The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, when a married couple killed 14 people celebrating the holidays in San Bernardino last Thursday, President Obama immediately used this terrible tragedy to renew his call for tougher gun restrictions. Never mind the fact that the shooting took place in California, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the Nation, or that authorities would quickly determine this rampage was an act of terrorism that appears to have been inspired by the Islamic State. This messaging blunder led to last night's televised address from the Oval Office where President Obama sought to reassure the American people that his administration is taking the threat of terrorism seriously. Sadly, the only thing he revealed was he has no comprehensive strategy to confront and defeat ISIS. The President continues to cling to failing policy. This week the House will vote on a bipartisan bill to update our visa waiver program to reduce the risk of an extremist entering the country from abroad. However, only the Commander in Chief can provide the wide- ranging plan that is necessary to eliminate the danger caused by radical Islamist terrorism. We need more from President Obama about what can be done with our military, our intelligence-gathering, and our international partners. We are facing a new era of violence and terrorism where danger exists both abroad and on American soil. We must do all that we can to eliminate the extremist threat. It is easy to see why the American people have no faith in the Federal Government. While the United States remains one step behind our enemy and Americans wonder if our country is safe, the Justice Department is undermining Congress' spending authority by funneling money to President Obama's political allies. The Justice Department prosecutes cases against corporate bad actors, and those companies agree to settlements that often include financial penalties. However, the Department has begun to mandate that at least some of that penalty money be paid in the form of donations to nonprofits that allegedly aid consumers and bolster neighborhoods. The purpose of financial penalties is to punish the bad actors and provide restitution to real victims. However, the list of government- approved nonprofit beneficiaries reads like a who's who of liberal activist groups. An investigation by the House Judiciary and Financial Services Committees revealed that DOJ has used mandatory donations to direct as much as half a billion dollars to these activist groups. These payments also occur entirely outside of the congressional appropriations and oversight process. The Miscellaneous Receipts Act requires money received by the government from any source to be deposited in the Treasury. Directing banks to give money to third parties evades that statute. Thank goodness the House passed an amendment by Chairman Goodlatte in June that blocks funding for negotiating settlements that require a defendant to donate to an organization or an individual not involved in the litigation. This commonsense amendment passed by voice vote and should absolutely be included in the omnibus spending bill we are expected to vote on this week. It is time for Republicans to confront this administration and restore the people's faith in their government. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [House] [Page H9015] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IT IS TIME TO RESTORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S FAITH IN GOVERNMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore.

They want to see leadership that will communicate the message: we are going to find you, we are going to destroy you, and we are going to destroy your networks. That is not what the President has been saying. My constituents see him as being very timid and very hesitant in this fight. They feel like that he just does not get it. They have a lot of questions that they are asking me: Why is it that he is so timid in fighting terrorism? Could it be that he does not possess the courage to call them out?

The President has promised no ground troops and more gun control. He called ISIS the JV team. They defied American airstrikes and expanded their caliphate, killing everyone in their way.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. General Leave Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is a Senate bill that we take up today, but there has actually been a House bill that is almost exactly the same for the last year or so. The story behind how this bill comes to the floor is one of those stories that should make folks confident that the system can work. I was on a Facebook townhall meeting about a year and a half ago and got a question from one of the constituents about all the money that they have heard the government wastes by paying the wrong people, paying dead people, or paying people way too much money. I remember it specifically, Mr. Speaker, because shortly after that, my uncle passed away. When my uncle passed away, I was named executor of his estate. It was the first time I have ever been the executor of an estate. One of the things I remember was that I got a notice 10 days after he had died, very shortly--2 weeks--from the Social Security Administration saying: You are going to get another check for your uncle. Don't cash it or else you can be in a lot of trouble. I thought that was really neat. Here is a Federal agency that is actually doing its job in very short order and very efficiently. And I filed that away. A couple months later, Mr. Speaker, my good friend from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows), who is the subcommittee chairman of the Government Operations on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, was having a hearing about all of these payments that we are not supposed to be making. I had a chance to ask some questions, and I told that story to the government witnesses from the executive branch who were there. I said: Look, how is it that this works so well in the Social Security Administration, but we have all these tales of all these improper payments going to other people? They said: Well, Mr. Congressman, that is because the Social Security Administration has a really, really good database, and they process the information very well when folks die. I asked what I thought was a relatively straightforward question: Why don't they share the information with the other Federal agencies? That was the genesis of this bill. What we set out to try and do is try and take circumstances, take examples of where the Federal Government actually does its job well and use that as a model that can be shared by other parts of the government. Mr. Speaker, the bill, by the way, that we are talking about is S. 614. There was a House version of it that I worked off of, just because I am a little bit more familiar with it. It is H.R. 2320. The language is almost exactly the same. I want to thank Mrs. Bustos, Mr. Connolly, and also Mr. Carter of Georgia and Mr. Westmoreland of Georgia, who are the original cosponsors of this. Mr. Speaker, the bill does two very specific, large things and one small thing. It expands that Social Security database. So it takes this, again, this example of something that actually works the way that it is supposed to, and lets other folks use the information. What does that mean? States will now be able to use it. State contractors will now be able to gain access to it. The judicial branch will be able to gain access to it, and the legislative branch will as well. So the example is that this really good information is not being shared broadly throughout governments--local, State, and Federal--and we are seeking to fix that in the bill. The other thing the bill does is to expand what is called the Do Not Pay portal. This is a database that is managed by the United States Department of the Treasury and contains, again, [[Page H9020]] really good information about who has passed away, how much money people should be receiving, who has moved, and who is entitled to benefits and who is not. By the way, there is a third thing that the bill does, Mr. Speaker. It seems inevitable that we cannot pass a bill here without asking for a report that goes along with it. But I think it is probably common sense to say that at some point in the future, we would like the Treasury to tell us if it is actually working. It is not very often, Mr. Speaker, that I come up here and tell you that there are examples of the Federal Government doing its job well; but when we do find those examples, I am very happy to get up and admit it. As a small government, conservative Republican, ordinarily I am the one that says government never does anything right; but here, actually, parts and parcels of the Federal Government are doing their job well. If we can take that example, take that model and expand it to other parts of the government, we would actually have a chance to solve what is a real problem. We spent about $125 billion last year on improper payments, payments to people who should not have received it, payments to people who have passed away, or payments to people in the wrong amount--$125 billion. We just had a major fight on this floor 2 weeks ago over spending $80 billion extra in the budget bill, yet we spend that much, half again, on improper payments every single year. In fact, it is one of the fastest growing line items in our budget. That $125 billion represents a 15 percent increase over the previous year. One of the fastest growing areas of our government is improper payments. So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank Mrs. Bustos, Mr. Connolly, Mr. Carter of Georgia, and Mr. Westmoreland in the House for helping bring this bill to the floor. Also, I want to thank Senator Carper from Delaware and Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin for shepherding it through the Senate. This is their bill that we are taking. I guess that is another inevitability, that, if the Senate has the same bill as the House does, the Senate gets all the credit. But sometimes it is interesting to see what you can actually accomplish around here, Mr. Speaker, if you don't worry about who gets the credit. I do want to thank the folks who took the time and the effort to shepherd this very sound, well-considered, and bipartisan bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Federal Improper Payments Coordination Act before the House this afternoon. I am pleased to join my friend from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) in sponsoring the House companion of this bipartisan legislation. He has already mentioned the cosponsors, Cheri Bustos, Buddy Carter, and Lynn Westmoreland among them. I also want to thank our Senate partners for their work on this important initiative. I want to assure my friend, Mr. Mulvaney, we are going to be marking up a companion bill to this tomorrow in our committee, and hopefully we will send it over to the Senate with a House number on it. Fair is fair. This is the latest in a series of commonsense, good-government laws we have enacted over the last decade as we work to reduce, if not outright eliminate, billions of taxpayer dollars in improper payments made by Federal agencies. The gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) pointed out just how large a number this is: $125 billion a year. Now, over a decade, that is $1.25 trillion. That exceeds all of sequestration. We wouldn't have to make any cuts to investments or raise any taxes to deal with sequestration if we just dealt with this. With the GAO reporting nearly $125 billion of improper payments, it is clear that more can and must be done to deal with government waste and fraud. Today's legislation would expand the use, as Mr. Mulvaney indicated, of the Do Not Pay Initiative to the legislative and judicial branches and to our State partners. That initiative was the result of the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012, which was also a product of our committee, and I was pleased to cosponsor it at that time. The Do Not Pay Initiative was launched by Treasury and leverages multiple data sources--many of which were formerly siloed--to create a central, comprehensive list that Federal agencies can quickly reference to determine whether an individual or organization is, in fact, eligible to receive a Federal grant, benefit, or contract; and it also allows them to verify such payments after the fact. For example, this initiative has prompted agencies to better share the reporting of death information to help reduce Federal payments to those, obviously, we have lost or for those who have had their identities stolen. Today's legislation would require the Departments of Defense and State to report information on deaths that occur overseas more quickly so that the agencies can better detect fraudulent payments or recoup improper payments if necessary. Just last week, Mr. Speaker, the Office of Management and Budget delivered its first report to Congress on the Do Not Pay Initiative, which it says resulted in more than $2 billion in stopped payments-- that is to say, savings for the U.S. taxpayer. Obviously, we can, with this bill, increase that number even more. Based on that early success, it makes good sense for us to expand the use of this valuable tool to the legislative and judicial branches, as well as our State partners, so they have the ability to quickly verify payments or the eligibility of recipients to receive such payments. This commonsense proposal was a welcomed suggestion from the GAO in its latest report on improper payments. I would also add that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee will continue this work, as I indicated, with a markup tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Mulvaney, for his leadership on this matter, and I urge our colleagues to support this important reform to our government in making it more efficient and accountable to the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), my good friend and the cosponsor of this legislation. Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Connolly and Congressman Mulvaney for their hard work on this. Mr. Speaker, as one of the Democratic coleaders of this legislation, I am so proud to rise in support of the Federal Improper Payments Coordination Act of 2015. The goal of this bill is straightforward: simply, to save taxpayer dollars that are currently going to waste and to make the Federal Government more effective and more efficient. Each year, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends billions of dollars in improper payments. This not only wastes taxpayer dollars, but it also erodes the public trust in government. Just last year, as my colleagues have pointed out, improper payments by the Federal Government rose to $125 billion. That is more than $1 trillion over a decade. That is according to the Office of Management and Budget. It is also an increase of 15 percent up from the year before, where it was $106 billion. So we are talking about real money here. In tough times, working families have to figure out how to cut costs to get their budgets in line. We all know that. I think it is time that Washington do the same thing. That is why our bill takes reasonable-- reasonable--steps to improve information sharing between Federal and State agencies to prevent these improper payments. This also helps modernize Federal agencies by putting 21st century data analytics to work in identifying and eliminating governmentwide waste and fraud. The status quo is, plain and simple, not acceptable. At a time when so many working families have to tighten their belts and cut costs, they expect Congress to act responsibly with their hard- earned taxpayer dollars. This bipartisan legislation represents a commonsense approach to a problem that is costing the taxpayers billions of dollars. This is undermining the effectiveness and the credibility of the Federal Government. I thank Congressman Mulvaney and Congressman Connolly. I think this is [[Page H9021]] an indication that we know how to work together. I want to applaud my colleagues for joining our efforts to protect taxpayers. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1600 Mr. CONNOLLY. Again, I want to thank my friend, Mrs. Bustos, for her leadership on this very important issue. I, also, in closing, just want to say to my friend from South Carolina, part of improper payments is also fraud, and the biggest chunk of that is Medicare fraud. We need the help of U.S. Attorney's Offices to go after that. I am aware of one U.S. Attorney's Office last year that identified and recovered $3 billion of Medicare fraud. Now, I believe there are 99 U.S. Attorney's Offices in the United States. If every one of them made going after this fraud a priority, I assure you, we could significantly reduce improper payments by a commensurate amount. I would be glad to work with him and my friend, Mrs. Bustos, on a bipartisan basis to address that aspect of it as well. Again, I want to thank Mr. Mulvaney for his leadership and for the bipartisan approach we have approached this legislation. We have no more speakers on our side, Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 614. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [House] [Pages H9018-H9021] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEDERAL IMPROPER PAYMENTS COORDINATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. MULVANEY.

One of the things I remember was that I got a notice 10 days after he had died, very shortly--2 weeks--from the Social Security Administration saying: You are going to get another check for your uncle. Don't cash it or else you can be in a lot of trouble. I thought that was really neat. Here is a Federal agency that is actually doing its job in very short order and very efficiently. And I filed that away. A couple months later, Mr. Speaker, my good friend from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows), who is the subcommittee chairman of the Government Operations on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, was having a hearing about all of these payments that we are not supposed to be making. I had a chance to ask some questions, and I told that story to the government witnesses from the executive branch who were there. I said: Look, how is it that this works so well in the Social Security Administration, but we have all these tales of all these improper payments going to other people? They said: Well, Mr. Congressman, that is because the Social Security Administration has a really, really good database, and they process the information very well when folks die. I asked what I thought was a relatively straightforward question: Why don't they share the information with the other Federal agencies? That was the genesis of this bill. What we set out to try and do is try and take circumstances, take examples of where the Federal Government actually does its job well and use that as a model that can be shared by other parts of the government. Mr. Speaker, the bill, by the way, that we are talking about is S. 614. There was a House version of it that I worked off of, just because I am a little bit more familiar with it. It is H.R. 2320. The language is almost exactly the same. I want to thank Mrs. Bustos, Mr. Connolly, and also Mr. Carter of Georgia and Mr. Westmoreland of Georgia, who are the original cosponsors of this. Mr. Speaker, the bill does two very specific, large things and one small thing. It expands that Social Security database. So it takes this, again, this example of something that actually works the way that it is supposed to, and lets other folks use the information. What does that mean? States will now be able to use it. State contractors will now be able to gain access to it. The judicial branch will be able to gain access to it, and the legislative branch will as well. So the example is that this really good information is not being shared broadly throughout governments--local, State, and Federal--and we are seeking to fix that in the bill. The other thing the bill does is to expand what is called the Do Not Pay portal. This is a database that is managed by the United States Department of the Treasury and contains, again, [[Page H9020]] really good information about who has passed away, how much money people should be receiving, who has moved, and who is entitled to benefits and who is not. By the way, there is a third thing that the bill does, Mr. Speaker. It seems inevitable that we cannot pass a bill here without asking for a report that goes along with it. But I think it is probably common sense to say that at some point in the future, we would like the Treasury to tell us if it is actually working. It is not very often, Mr. Speaker, that I come up here and tell you that there are examples of the Federal Government doing its job well; but when we do find those examples, I am very happy to get up and admit it. As a small government, conservative Republican, ordinarily I am the one that says government never does anything right; but here, actually, parts and parcels of the Federal Government are doing their job well. If we can take that example, take that model and expand it to other parts of the government, we would actually have a chance to solve what is a real problem. We spent about $125 billion last year on improper payments, payments to people who should not have received it, payments to people who have passed away, or payments to people in the wrong amount--$125 billion. We just had a major fight on this floor 2 weeks ago over spending $80 billion extra in the budget bill, yet we spend that much, half again, on improper payments every single year. In fact, it is one of the fastest growing line items in our budget. That $125 billion represents a 15 percent increase over the previous year. One of the fastest growing areas of our government is improper payments. So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank Mrs. Bustos, Mr. Connolly, Mr. Carter of Georgia, and Mr. Westmoreland in the House for helping bring this bill to the floor. Also, I want to thank Senator Carper from Delaware and Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin for shepherding it through the Senate. This is their bill that we are taking. I guess that is another inevitability, that, if the Senate has the same bill as the House does, the Senate gets all the credit. But sometimes it is interesting to see what you can actually accomplish around here, Mr. Speaker, if you don't worry about who gets the credit. I do want to thank the folks who took the time and the effort to shepherd this very sound, well-considered, and bipartisan bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Federal Improper Payments Coordination Act before the House this afternoon. I am pleased to join my friend from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) in sponsoring the House companion of this bipartisan legislation. He has already mentioned the cosponsors, Cheri Bustos, Buddy Carter, and Lynn Westmoreland among them. I also want to thank our Senate partners for their work on this important initiative. I want to assure my friend, Mr. Mulvaney, we are going to be marking up a companion bill to this tomorrow in our committee, and hopefully we will send it over to the Senate with a House number on it. Fair is fair. This is the latest in a series of commonsense, good-government laws we have enacted over the last decade as we work to reduce, if not outright eliminate, billions of taxpayer dollars in improper payments made by Federal agencies. The gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) pointed out just how large a number this is: $125 billion a year. Now, over a decade, that is $1.25 trillion. That exceeds all of sequestration. We wouldn't have to make any cuts to investments or raise any taxes to deal with sequestration if we just dealt with this. With the GAO reporting nearly $125 billion of improper payments, it is clear that more can and must be done to deal with government waste and fraud. Today's legislation would expand the use, as Mr. Mulvaney indicated, of the Do Not Pay Initiative to the legislative and judicial branches and to our State partners. That initiative was the result of the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012, which was also a product of our committee, and I was pleased to cosponsor it at that time. The Do Not Pay Initiative was launched by Treasury and leverages multiple data sources--many of which were formerly siloed--to create a central, comprehensive list that Federal agencies can quickly reference to determine whether an individual or organization is, in fact, eligible to receive a Federal grant, benefit, or contract; and it also allows them to verify such payments after the fact. For example, this initiative has prompted agencies to better share the reporting of death information to help reduce Federal payments to those, obviously, we have lost or for those who have had their identities stolen. Today's legislation would require the Departments of Defense and State to report information on deaths that occur overseas more quickly so that the agencies can better detect fraudulent payments or recoup improper payments if necessary. Just last week, Mr. Speaker, the Office of Management and Budget delivered its first report to Congress on the Do Not Pay Initiative, which it says resulted in more than $2 billion in stopped payments-- that is to say, savings for the U.S. taxpayer. Obviously, we can, with this bill, increase that number even more. Based on that early success, it makes good sense for us to expand the use of this valuable tool to the legislative and judicial branches, as well as our State partners, so they have the ability to quickly verify payments or the eligibility of recipients to receive such payments. This commonsense proposal was a welcomed suggestion from the GAO in its latest report on improper payments. I would also add that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee will continue this work, as I indicated, with a markup tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Mulvaney, for his leadership on this matter, and I urge our colleagues to support this important reform to our government in making it more efficient and accountable to the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), my good friend and the cosponsor of this legislation. Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Connolly and Congressman Mulvaney for their hard work on this. Mr. Speaker, as one of the Democratic coleaders of this legislation, I am so proud to rise in support of the Federal Improper Payments Coordination Act of 2015. The goal of this bill is straightforward: simply, to save taxpayer dollars that are currently going to waste and to make the Federal Government more effective and more efficient. Each year, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends billions of dollars in improper payments. This not only wastes taxpayer dollars, but it also erodes the public trust in government. Just last year, as my colleagues have pointed out, improper payments by the Federal Government rose to $125 billion. That is more than $1 trillion over a decade. That is according to the Office of Management and Budget. It is also an increase of 15 percent up from the year before, where it was $106 billion. So we are talking about real money here. In tough times, working families have to figure out how to cut costs to get their budgets in line. We all know that. I think it is time that Washington do the same thing. That is why our bill takes reasonable-- reasonable--steps to improve information sharing between Federal and State agencies to prevent these improper payments. This also helps modernize Federal agencies by putting 21st century data analytics to work in identifying and eliminating governmentwide waste and fraud. The status quo is, plain and simple, not acceptable. At a time when so many working families have to tighten their belts and cut costs, they expect Congress to act responsibly with their hard- earned taxpayer dollars. This bipartisan legislation represents a commonsense approach to a problem that is costing the taxpayers billions of dollars. This is undermining the effectiveness and the credibility of the Federal Government. I thank Congressman Mulvaney and Congressman Connolly. I think this is [[Page H9021]] an indication that we know how to work together. I want to applaud my colleagues for joining our efforts to protect taxpayers. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1600 Mr. CONNOLLY. Again, I want to thank my friend, Mrs. Bustos, for her leadership on this very important issue. I, also, in closing, just want to say to my friend from South Carolina, part of improper payments is also fraud, and the biggest chunk of that is Medicare fraud. We need the help of U.S. Attorney's Offices to go after that. I am aware of one U.S. Attorney's Office last year that identified and recovered $3 billion of Medicare fraud. Now, I believe there are 99 U.S. Attorney's Offices in the United States. If every one of them made going after this fraud a priority, I assure you, we could significantly reduce improper payments by a commensurate amount. I would be glad to work with him and my friend, Mrs. Bustos, on a bipartisan basis to address that aspect of it as well. Again, I want to thank Mr. Mulvaney for his leadership and for the bipartisan approach we have approached this legislation. We have no more speakers on our side, Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 614. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [House] [Pages H9018-H9021] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEDERAL IMPROPER PAYMENTS COORDINATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. MULVANEY.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. General Leave Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is a Senate bill that we take up today, but there has actually been a House bill that is almost exactly the same for the last year or so. The story behind how this bill comes to the floor is one of those stories that should make folks confident that the system can work. I was on a Facebook townhall meeting about a year and a half ago and got a question from one of the constituents about all the money that they have heard the government wastes by paying the wrong people, paying dead people, or paying people way too much money. I remember it specifically, Mr. Speaker, because shortly after that, my uncle passed away. When my uncle passed away, I was named executor of his estate. It was the first time I have ever been the executor of an estate. One of the things I remember was that I got a notice 10 days after he had died, very shortly--2 weeks--from the Social Security Administration saying: You are going to get another check for your uncle. Don't cash it or else you can be in a lot of trouble. I thought that was really neat. Here is a Federal agency that is actually doing its job in very short order and very efficiently.

carolina (mr. mulvaney) and the gentleman from virginia (mr. connolly) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from south carolina. general leave mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from south carolina? there was no objection. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, this is a senate bill that we take up today, but there has actually been a house bill that is almost exactly the same for the last year or so. the story behind how this bill comes to the floor is one of those stories that should make folks confident that the system can work. i was on a facebook townhall meeting about a year and a half ago and got a question from one of the constituents about all the money that they have heard the government wastes by paying the wrong people, paying dead people, or paying people way too much money. i remember it specifically, mr. speaker, because shortly after that, my uncle passed away. when my uncle passed away, i was named executor of his estate. it was the first time i have ever been the executor of an estate. one of the things i remember was that i got a notice 10 days after he had died, very shortly--2 weeks--from the social security administration saying: you are going to get another check for your uncle. don't cash it or else you can be in a lot of trouble. i thought that was really neat. here is a federal agency that is actually doing its job in very short order and very efficiently. and i filed that away. a couple months later, mr. speaker, my good friend from north carolina (mr. meadows), who is the subcommittee chairman of the government operations on the oversight and government reform committee, was having a hearing about all of these payments that we are not supposed to be making. i had a chance to ask some questions, and i told that story to the government witnesses from the executive branch who were there. i said: look, how is it that this works so well in the social security administration, but we have all these tales of all these improper payments going to other people? they said: well, mr. congressman, that is because the social security administration has a really, really good database, and they process the information very well when folks die. i asked what i thought was a relatively straightforward question: why don't they share the information with the other federal agencies? that was the genesis of this bill. what we set out to try and do is try and take circumstances, take examples of where the federal government actually does its job well and use that as a model that can be shared by other parts of the government. mr. speaker, the bill, by the way, that we are talking about is s. 614. there was a house version of it that i worked off of, just because i am a little bit more familiar with it. it is h.r. 2320. the language is almost exactly the same. i want to thank mrs. bustos, mr. connolly, and also mr. carter of georgia and mr. westmoreland of georgia, who are the original cosponsors of this. mr. speaker, the bill does two very specific, large things and one small thing. it expands that social security database. so it takes this, again, this example of something that actually works the way that it is supposed to, and lets other folks use the information. what does that mean? states will now be able to use it. state contractors will now be able to gain access to it. the judicial branch will be able to gain access to it, and the legislative branch will as well. so the example is that this really good information is not being shared broadly throughout governments--local, state, and federal--and we are seeking to fix that in the bill. the other thing the bill does is to expand what is called the do not pay portal. this is a database that is managed by the united states department of the treasury and contains, again, [[page h9020]] really good information about who has passed away, how much money people should be receiving, who has moved, and who is entitled to benefits and who is not. by the way, there is a third thing that the bill does, mr. speaker. it seems inevitable that we cannot pass a bill here without asking for a report that goes along with it. but i think it is probably common sense to say that at some point in the future, we would like the treasury to tell us if it is actually working. it is not very often, mr. speaker, that i come up here and tell you that there are examples of the federal government doing its job well; but when we do find those examples, i am very happy to get up and admit it. as a small government, conservative republican, ordinarily i am the one that says government never does anything right; but here, actually, parts and parcels of the federal government are doing their job well. if we can take that example, take that model and expand it to other parts of the government, we would actually have a chance to solve what is a real problem. we spent about $125 billion last year on improper payments, payments to people who should not have received it, payments to people who have passed away, or payments to people in the wrong amount--$125 billion. we just had a major fight on this floor 2 weeks ago over spending $80 billion extra in the budget bill, yet we spend that much, half again, on improper payments every single year. in fact, it is one of the fastest growing line items in our budget. that $125 billion represents a 15 percent increase over the previous year. one of the fastest growing areas of our government is improper payments. so, mr. speaker, i just want to thank mrs. bustos, mr. connolly, mr. carter of georgia, and mr. westmoreland in the house for helping bring this bill to the floor. also, i want to thank senator carper from delaware and senator ron johnson from wisconsin for shepherding it through the senate. this is their bill that we are taking. i guess that is another inevitability, that, if the senate has the same bill as the house does, the senate gets all the credit. but sometimes it is interesting to see what you can actually accomplish around here, mr. speaker, if you don't worry about who gets the credit. i do want to thank the folks who took the time and the effort to shepherd this very sound, well-considered, and bipartisan bill to the floor today. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. connolly. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the federal improper payments coordination act before the house this afternoon. i am pleased to join my friend from south carolina (mr. mulvaney) in sponsoring the house companion of this bipartisan legislation. he has already mentioned the cosponsors, cheri bustos, buddy carter, and lynn westmoreland among them. i also want to thank our senate partners for their work on this important initiative. i want to assure my friend, mr. mulvaney, we are going to be marking up a companion bill to this tomorrow in our committee, and hopefully we will send it over to the senate with a house number on it. fair is fair. this is the latest in a series of commonsense, good-government laws we have enacted over the last decade as we work to reduce, if not outright eliminate, billions of taxpayer dollars in improper payments made by federal agencies. the gentleman from south carolina (mr. mulvaney) pointed out just how large a number this is: $125 billion a year. now, over a decade, that is $1.25 trillion. that exceeds all of sequestration. we wouldn't have to make any cuts to investments or raise any taxes to deal with sequestration if we just dealt with this. with the gao reporting nearly $125 billion of improper payments, it is clear that more can and must be done to deal with government waste and fraud. today's legislation would expand the use, as mr. mulvaney indicated, of the do not pay initiative to the legislative and judicial branches and to our state partners. that initiative was the result of the improper payments elimination and recovery improvement act of 2012, which was also a product of our committee, and i was pleased to cosponsor it at that time. the do not pay initiative was launched by treasury and leverages multiple data sources--many of which were formerly siloed--to create a central, comprehensive list that federal agencies can quickly reference to determine whether an individual or organization is, in fact, eligible to receive a federal grant, benefit, or contract; and it also allows them to verify such payments after the fact. for example, this initiative has prompted agencies to better share the reporting of death information to help reduce federal payments to those, obviously, we have lost or for those who have had their identities stolen. today's legislation would require the departments of defense and state to report information on deaths that occur overseas more quickly so that the agencies can better detect fraudulent payments or recoup improper payments if necessary. just last week, mr. speaker, the office of management and budget delivered its first report to congress on the do not pay initiative, which it says resulted in more than $2 billion in stopped payments-- that is to say, savings for the u.s. taxpayer. obviously, we can, with this bill, increase that number even more. based on that early success, it makes good sense for us to expand the use of this valuable tool to the legislative and judicial branches, as well as our state partners, so they have the ability to quickly verify payments or the eligibility of recipients to receive such payments. this commonsense proposal was a welcomed suggestion from the gao in its latest report on improper payments. i would also add that the oversight and government reform committee will continue this work, as i indicated, with a markup tomorrow. mr. speaker, again, i want to thank my colleague, mr. mulvaney, for his leadership on this matter, and i urge our colleagues to support this important reform to our government in making it more efficient and accountable to the taxpayer. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from illinois (mrs. bustos), my good friend and the cosponsor of this legislation. mrs. bustos. mr. speaker, i thank congressman connolly and congressman mulvaney for their hard work on this. mr. speaker, as one of the democratic coleaders of this legislation, i am so proud to rise in support of the federal improper payments coordination act of 2015. the goal of this bill is straightforward: simply, to save taxpayer dollars that are currently going to waste and to make the federal government more effective and more efficient. each year, mr. speaker, the federal government spends billions of dollars in improper payments. this not only wastes taxpayer dollars, but it also erodes the public trust in government. just last year, as my colleagues have pointed out, improper payments by the federal government rose to $125 billion. that is more than $1 trillion over a decade. that is according to the office of management and budget. it is also an increase of 15 percent up from the year before, where it was $106 billion. so we are talking about real money here. in tough times, working families have to figure out how to cut costs to get their budgets in line. we all know that. i think it is time that washington do the same thing. that is why our bill takes reasonable-- reasonable--steps to improve information sharing between federal and state agencies to prevent these improper payments. this also helps modernize federal agencies by putting 21st century data analytics to work in identifying and eliminating governmentwide waste and fraud. the status quo is, plain and simple, not acceptable. at a time when so many working families have to tighten their belts and cut costs, they expect congress to act responsibly with their hard- earned taxpayer dollars. this bipartisan legislation represents a commonsense approach to a problem that is costing the taxpayers billions of dollars. this is undermining the effectiveness and the credibility of the federal government. i thank congressman mulvaney and congressman connolly. i think this is [[page h9021]] an indication that we know how to work together. i want to applaud my colleagues for joining our efforts to protect taxpayers. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1600 mr. connolly. again, i want to thank my friend, mrs. bustos, for her leadership on this very important issue. i, also, in closing, just want to say to my friend from south carolina, part of improper payments is also fraud, and the biggest chunk of that is medicare fraud. we need the help of u.s. attorney's offices to go after that. i am aware of one u.s. attorney's office last year that identified and recovered $3 billion of medicare fraud. now, i believe there are 99 u.s. attorney's offices in the united states. if every one of them made going after this fraud a priority, i assure you, we could significantly reduce improper payments by a commensurate amount. i would be glad to work with him and my friend, mrs. bustos, on a bipartisan basis to address that aspect of it as well. again, i want to thank mr. mulvaney for his leadership and for the bipartisan approach we have approached this legislation. we have no more speakers on our side, mr. speaker. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, i have no further speakers, and i urge adoption. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from south carolina (mr. mulvaney) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 614. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",21216

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1321) to prohibit the sale or distribution of cosmetics containing synthetic plastic microbeads, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1321 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF RINSE-OFF COSMETICS CONTAINING PLASTIC MICROBEADS. (a) In General.--Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 331) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(ddd)(1) The manufacture or the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a rinse-off cosmetic that contains intentionally-added plastic microbeads. ``(2) In this paragraph-- ``(A) the term `plastic microbead' means any solid plastic particle that is less than five millimeters in size and is intended to be used to exfoliate or cleanse the human body or any part thereof; and ``(B) the term `rinse-off cosmetic' includes toothpaste.''.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1321, the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015. I am pleased to have partnered with my friend, Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone from New Jersey, on this very important bill to begin the phaseout of plastic microbeads, which you can see in this picture, literally the size of a pinhead sometimes on a penny, to begin the phaseout of plastic microbeads from personal care products on July 1, 2017. Many folks might be wondering, what exactly is a microbead? Well, I am sure many of you here and at home are using products that contain microbeads without even realizing it. Microbeads are those tiny little scrubbers in cleansers, body scrubs, and even toothpaste. On their own, they are nearly invisible, smaller than a pinhead, as I indicated. But once they are flushed down the drain, that is when the problem really begins. They are so small they easily flow through the water filtration systems and end up in our bodies of water, obviously, including the Great Lakes, where I hail from. They are known to absorb pollutants and often mistaken as food by fish and wildlife. Simply put, microbeads are causing megaproblems. As someone who grew up on Lake Michigan and represents a large chunk of the Michigan coastline, I understand firsthand how important it is to maintain the beauty and integrity of our Great Lakes and all of our water systems. The Great Lakes have survived many a foe--severe pollution, oil spills, discharge from refineries, zebra mussels, and attempts to steal our water, just to name a few. We are going to fight any activity that puts our beloved Great Lakes in jeopardy. Many State and local governments have created a patchwork of differing laws, which creates problems for interstate commerce. This bipartisan legislation will also preempt all State and local laws related to microbeads in cosmetics, which will ensure certainty for manufacturers and other job creators across the country. I urge all my colleagues to join me in ending this pesky problem of microbeads. They are tiny plastic, but big time pollution. As Michigan's Holland Sentinel editorialized this past spring, ``There's no reason keeping our faces feeling clean should require us to trash our lakes.'' I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1321, the Microbead- Free Waters Act of 2015. This legislation sets up a strong Federal program to ban the use of plastic microbeads in personal care products. I would like to personally thank Chairman Fred Upton for working with me to introduce and move this important legislation. Plastic microbeads have been in use in cosmetic products, such as face washes and toothpaste, for many years. These tiny plastic beads are often used as exfoliants, removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. While these plastic particles are not harmful to the user of the product, in recent years, studies have shown that these tiny particles that are often washed down the drain are making it through the wastewater treatment process and ending up in our Nation's waterways. We must put a stop to this unnecessary and avoidable pollution. [[Page H9022]] Mr. Speaker, studies conducted in the Great Lakes, the world's largest source of freshwater, have turned up alarmingly high levels of microplastic. In addition to contributing to the buildup of plastic pollution in waterways, microbeads can often be mistaken by fish and other organisms as food. I have serious concerns about fish and other aquatic life potentially ingesting these particles and the effect this could have on humans who consume fish that have ingested the plastic. Numerous natural, biodegradable alternatives to plastic microbeads already exist in commerce and product supply chains, including apricot seeds, walnut shells, and pecan shell powder. Several personal care product companies have already announced plans to phase out the use of plastic microbeads in their products in favor of natural exfoliants. Beginning with Illinois in 2014, nine States have enacted some form of a ban on plastic microbeads in personal care products. Yet, in my opinion, we need a national solution. Our Nation's waterways do not always respect State boundaries. In order to put a stop to these plastic particles making their way into our oceans, lakes, and streams, we need to ban plastic microbeads in every State. The legislation before us today is the product of bipartisan input since it has moved through the committee process. Chairman Upton and I have worked to strengthen and clarify a number of provisions in the bill, most notably, by setting up an aggressive timetable for the phaseout of these products, which begins in 2017, earlier than any of the currently enacted State laws. The legislation exclusively bans the use of biodegradable plastic as an alternative ingredient, a loophole that has been discovered in a number of existing State laws. Many of the State laws contain a provision allowing companies to transition to biodegradable plastic as an alternative ingredient, and little is known about the ability of these biodegradable plastics to break down in a marine environment. The language we used to define the scope of this bill was carefully chosen. Plastic microbead is defined as any solid plastic particle that is less than 5 millimeters in size and is used to exfoliate or cleanse the human body. This definition limiting the scope to exfoliating products is also in all nine State-passed laws, and it focuses the prohibition on the products currently containing plastic microbeads that are being washed down the drain. The bill also includes preemption of State laws regulating plastic microbeads and cosmetics. While I am typically not a supporter of preempting State law, the strong Federal standard we have developed is more protective and implementation will occur sooner than in any State law in place. Mr. Speaker, limiting pollution in our Nation's waterways has always been one of my top priorities. It is an issue that helps further creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 after the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire. While much progress has been made, we must continue our efforts to protect America's waterways. And by banning plastic microbeads in personal care products, we are taking one more step towards a cleaner and healthier environment in America. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Again, thank our Chairman Upton, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this time to thank my colleague, Mr. Pallone. This was his legislation, which I cosponsored, as he indicated. We moved it through regular order, lots of hearings, a unanimous vote in subcommittee and full committee, and we want to get this bill to the President for him to sign. As I have talked to Members of the Great Lakes Coalition, our colleagues in the Great Lakes States--Republican and Democrat--but also our Senators from the Great Lakes as well, there is huge interest in getting this bill to the President. It will, indeed, make a difference. The phaseout time was appropriate, so, in essence, we are telling the manufacturers to stop making it, and a time then for them to see the products off the shelf, so that ultimately, they will not be in cosmetics or toothpaste and other personal care products. Again, I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this. I look forward to passing it on a bipartisan vote. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me thank the chairman again. As he pointed out, this truly has been a bipartisan effort. There is also a Senate bill that is bipartisan that this matches, which I think was a strong indication that we can get this bill not only passed here, but also in the Senate and get it to the President's desk. I should also point out that this is one of those occasions, which happens quite a bit, even though people don't realize it, where the industry is actually in cooperation with us, and the cosmetic products industry supports this initiative as well. For all those reasons, let's get the bill passed, and I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1321, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the manufacture and introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of rinse-off cosmetics containing intentionally-added plastic microbeads.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [House] [Pages H9021-H9022] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MICROBEAD-FREE WATERS ACT OF 2015 Mr. UPTON.

(c) Preemption of State Laws.--No State or political subdivision of a State may directly or indirectly establish under any authority or continue in effect restrictions with respect to the manufacture or introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of rinse-off cosmetics containing plastic microbeads (as defined in section 301(ddd) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as added by subsection (a)) that are not identical to the restrictions under such section 301(ddd) that have begun to apply under subsection (b). (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act (or the amendments made by this Act) shall be construed to apply with respect to drugs that are not also cosmetics (as such terms are defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321)). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1321, the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015. I am pleased to have partnered with my friend, Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone from New Jersey, on this very important bill to begin the phaseout of plastic microbeads, which you can see in this picture, literally the size of a pinhead sometimes on a penny, to begin the phaseout of plastic microbeads from personal care products on July 1, 2017. Many folks might be wondering, what exactly is a microbead? Well, I am sure many of you here and at home are using products that contain microbeads without even realizing it. Microbeads are those tiny little scrubbers in cleansers, body scrubs, and even toothpaste. On their own, they are nearly invisible, smaller than a pinhead, as I indicated. But once they are flushed down the drain, that is when the problem really begins. They are so small they easily flow through the water filtration systems and end up in our bodies of water, obviously, including the Great Lakes, where I hail from. They are known to absorb pollutants and often mistaken as food by fish and wildlife. Simply put, microbeads are causing megaproblems. As someone who grew up on Lake Michigan and represents a large chunk of the Michigan coastline, I understand firsthand how important it is to maintain the beauty and integrity of our Great Lakes and all of our water systems. The Great Lakes have survived many a foe--severe pollution, oil spills, discharge from refineries, zebra mussels, and attempts to steal our water, just to name a few. We are going to fight any activity that puts our beloved Great Lakes in jeopardy. Many State and local governments have created a patchwork of differing laws, which creates problems for interstate commerce. This bipartisan legislation will also preempt all State and local laws related to microbeads in cosmetics, which will ensure certainty for manufacturers and other job creators across the country. I urge all my colleagues to join me in ending this pesky problem of microbeads. They are tiny plastic, but big time pollution. As Michigan's Holland Sentinel editorialized this past spring, ``There's no reason keeping our faces feeling clean should require us to trash our lakes.'' I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1321, the Microbead- Free Waters Act of 2015. This legislation sets up a strong Federal program to ban the use of plastic microbeads in personal care products. I would like to personally thank Chairman Fred Upton for working with me to introduce and move this important legislation. Plastic microbeads have been in use in cosmetic products, such as face washes and toothpaste, for many years. These tiny plastic beads are often used as exfoliants, removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. While these plastic particles are not harmful to the user of the product, in recent years, studies have shown that these tiny particles that are often washed down the drain are making it through the wastewater treatment process and ending up in our Nation's waterways. We must put a stop to this unnecessary and avoidable pollution. [[Page H9022]] Mr. Speaker, studies conducted in the Great Lakes, the world's largest source of freshwater, have turned up alarmingly high levels of microplastic. In addition to contributing to the buildup of plastic pollution in waterways, microbeads can often be mistaken by fish and other organisms as food. I have serious concerns about fish and other aquatic life potentially ingesting these particles and the effect this could have on humans who consume fish that have ingested the plastic. Numerous natural, biodegradable alternatives to plastic microbeads already exist in commerce and product supply chains, including apricot seeds, walnut shells, and pecan shell powder. Several personal care product companies have already announced plans to phase out the use of plastic microbeads in their products in favor of natural exfoliants. Beginning with Illinois in 2014, nine States have enacted some form of a ban on plastic microbeads in personal care products. Yet, in my opinion, we need a national solution. Our Nation's waterways do not always respect State boundaries. In order to put a stop to these plastic particles making their way into our oceans, lakes, and streams, we need to ban plastic microbeads in every State. The legislation before us today is the product of bipartisan input since it has moved through the committee process. Chairman Upton and I have worked to strengthen and clarify a number of provisions in the bill, most notably, by setting up an aggressive timetable for the phaseout of these products, which begins in 2017, earlier than any of the currently enacted State laws. The legislation exclusively bans the use of biodegradable plastic as an alternative ingredient, a loophole that has been discovered in a number of existing State laws. Many of the State laws contain a provision allowing companies to transition to biodegradable plastic as an alternative ingredient, and little is known about the ability of these biodegradable plastics to break down in a marine environment. The language we used to define the scope of this bill was carefully chosen. Plastic microbead is defined as any solid plastic particle that is less than 5 millimeters in size and is used to exfoliate or cleanse the human body. This definition limiting the scope to exfoliating products is also in all nine State-passed laws, and it focuses the prohibition on the products currently containing plastic microbeads that are being washed down the drain. The bill also includes preemption of State laws regulating plastic microbeads and cosmetics. While I am typically not a supporter of preempting State law, the strong Federal standard we have developed is more protective and implementation will occur sooner than in any State law in place. Mr. Speaker, limiting pollution in our Nation's waterways has always been one of my top priorities. It is an issue that helps further creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 after the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire. While much progress has been made, we must continue our efforts to protect America's waterways. And by banning plastic microbeads in personal care products, we are taking one more step towards a cleaner and healthier environment in America. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Again, thank our Chairman Upton, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this time to thank my colleague, Mr. Pallone. This was his legislation, which I cosponsored, as he indicated. We moved it through regular order, lots of hearings, a unanimous vote in subcommittee and full committee, and we want to get this bill to the President for him to sign. As I have talked to Members of the Great Lakes Coalition, our colleagues in the Great Lakes States--Republican and Democrat--but also our Senators from the Great Lakes as well, there is huge interest in getting this bill to the President. It will, indeed, make a difference. The phaseout time was appropriate, so, in essence, we are telling the manufacturers to stop making it, and a time then for them to see the products off the shelf, so that ultimately, they will not be in cosmetics or toothpaste and other personal care products. Again, I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this. I look forward to passing it on a bipartisan vote. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me thank the chairman again. As he pointed out, this truly has been a bipartisan effort. There is also a Senate bill that is bipartisan that this matches, which I think was a strong indication that we can get this bill not only passed here, but also in the Senate and get it to the President's desk. I should also point out that this is one of those occasions, which happens quite a bit, even though people don't realize it, where the industry is actually in cooperation with us, and the cosmetic products industry supports this initiative as well. For all those reasons, let's get the bill passed, and I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1321, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the manufacture and introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of rinse-off cosmetics containing intentionally-added plastic microbeads.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [House] [Pages H9021-H9022] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MICROBEAD-FREE WATERS ACT OF 2015 Mr. UPTON.

the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from michigan (mr. upton) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1321, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. the title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``a bill to amend the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act to prohibit the manufacture and introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of rinse-off cosmetics containing intentionally-added plastic microbeads.''. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",12721

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8430,CREC-2015-12-07,114,GUN VIOLENCE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8430-S8431] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the devastating impact gun violence has on our families and our communities across America. Every day in America, we have a staggering amount of gun violence. On average, 297 people are shot in America each day, and 89 of them die. On a typical day, there are 31 murders and 55 suicides by gun, as well as several accidental shootings. And every day, on average, 151 Americans are shot and wounded in an assault and 45 are accidently shot but survive. We have had over 350 mass shootings in America just this year, meaning incidents where at least four people are shot, and we have had over 50 incidents this year where guns have been fired at a school--50 at a school. These statistics are sobering and a call to action. Most shootings in America have become so routine, they don't even make the news. Sadly, many Americans believe this staggering level of violence is just a normal day in America. But in recent weeks, horrific mass shootings at a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs, CO, and a holiday party in San Bernardino have brought the issue of gun violence back into the forefront. After high-profile mass shootings, we often hear the gun lobby and their political allies say: Any effort to pass a new gun law is just politicizing a tragedy. They say: We don't need any new gun laws; what we really should do is enforce the laws on the books. We saw this dynamic play out just last week. The day after the San Bernardino shooting, the vast majority of Senate Democrats voted for an amendment by Senator Feinstein to close the loophole that lets suspected terrorists buy firearms in America. The vast majority of Senate Republicans voted no. Senate Democrats also voted overwhelmingly for a bipartisan amendment offered by Senators Manchin and Toomey. This amendment would close the loopholes that allow guns to be sold without background checks either on the Internet or at gun shows. Again, the Senate Republicans overwhelmingly voted against a background check to keep firearms out of the hands of convicted felons and mentally unstable people. Make no mistake--the whole world saw what happened last week in San Bernardino, and the whole world now knows that people who want to commit acts of mass violence or terror in the United States sadly have easy access to an arsenal of guns. There are major loopholes in the laws on the books. This is a serious vulnerability, and Americans know we need to address it. The risk of terrorist-inspired mass shootings like Paris has never been higher. What are most effective ways to guard against this vulnerability? Well, I thought those two amendments we considered last week were a good start. Won't we agree--even those who own guns, value them, use them for sport, hunting, or self-defense--won't we agree that keeping guns out of the hands of convicted felons and mentally unstable people is the starting point? I think we should. The ATF did a review of the crime guns that were seized in the highest crime areas in the city of Chicago. They found out that 40 percent of the guns used in the commission of crime in some of the deadliest precincts of Chicago came from northwest Indiana gun shows. Why? Well, because you don't go through a background check if you buy from certain people at a gun show. So the thugs, the drug gangs, the drive-by shooters--all they have to do is take the Skyway over the border into Indiana, go to one of those gun shows, fill their trunks with guns, firearms, and ammunition, and drive back for a killing spree in Chicago. There are no background checks. Does that make sense? When they say, ``Well, you know, it is a shame they have so much gun violence in Chicago because you know they have some of the strictest laws on the books,'' well, those strict laws don't apply when you cross the State line into Indiana. Sadly, those laws don't apply as they should across the United States. So we called the amendment on the floor, a bipartisan amendment. Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia-- neither one of them liberal by self-definition--have come forward and said--Joe Manchin said: I learned a long time ago that if you want to own a gun in West Virginia, in my family, you didn't sell it to a stranger, you didn't sell it to a criminal, and you certainly didn't sell it to someone who was mentally unstable. He said that is just common sense. Well, it is common sense that escaped the support and attention of the Senate Republicans. They voted against that provision overwhelmingly, against background checks to keep firearms out of the hands of convicted felons and those who are mentally unstable. How would you explain that? Well, it might be easier to explain that than to explain the other amendment they voted against. [[Page S8431]] Listen to this one. If our government, in their investigation, comes up with the name of a person they believe is involved in terrorism and they put them on a no-fly list so they can't get on an airplane, guess what--they can still go to a licensed gun dealer in America and buy a firearm. These mad people in San Bernardino had AR-15s, semiautomatic and automatic weapons. They weren't on a terrorist watch list that I know of or a no-fly list, but if their names had been on a list, it wouldn't have slowed them down one bit in making a purchase. So Senator Feinstein of California offered this amendment, an amendment which had previously been offered by the late Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey repeatedly. Senator Feinstein took up his cause and brought this amendment to the floor for a vote last week in Washington. I went back and looked at the Congressional Record to see what the objections were of the people who said they had to vote against the amendment which would say if you are on a terrorist fly list, you cannot purchase firearms or explosives in the United States. I read some of the statements that were made by the senior Senator from Texas. In his argument against this, he said: If you believe the Federal Government should be able to deprive an American citizen of one of their core constitutional rights without notice and an opportunity to be heard, then you should vote for the Senator's amendment. The Senator from Texas continued: This is not the way we are supposed to do things in this country. If you think that the Federal Government never makes a mistake and that presumptively the decisions the Federal Government makes about putting you on a list because of some suspicions, then you should vote for this amendment. So as far as he is concerned--and I suppose those who joined him in voting against this amendment--if your name is on a terrorist watch list in America as somebody we suspect is involved in terrorism, you start off by presuming the government must be wrong and the government has to prove it. You start off, in their position, by saying that the first thing we should do is let that presumed terrorist buy a gun and then let's have a due process hearing. What? What is he thinking? If you thought there was a dangerous person in your city or your community who might engage in terrorism, would you want them to buy an assault weapon? Would you want them to buy explosives? I wouldn't. Let's err on the side of safety and security and say: No, if you are on that list, you cannot purchase a weapon or an explosive. If you protest being on the list and don't think you belong there, so be it. That is your right. You are entitled to a process to get your name off the list, and the Feinstein amendment provides such a process. And if you prove that our government is wrong, then proceed with buying the gun or the explosives. But the presumption on the other side is that you are always entitled to buy a gun, you are always entitled to buy explosives, and if the government says otherwise, they have to prove it. It doesn't sound like a recipe for safety in America, but that is what happened on the floor of the Senate. So we called this measure, and there were 45 who voted yes and 54 voted no--45 to 54 on whether someone on the terrorist watch list should be able to be prohibited from buying firearms and explosives. There has been a lot of tough talk lately about terrorism, this dozen--13, 14; I forget the number--running for President on the Republican side. They are trying to out trump one another and get tougher with terrorists. Yet when the moment came on the floor of the Senate and the Republicans in the Senate--including three or four running for President--had a chance to vote to keep firearms and explosives out of the hands of suspected terrorists, they voted no. How does that make us any safer? Oh, they are tough as can be in their speeches, but when it comes down to their votes, they are nowhere to be found. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8430-S8431] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE Mr. DURBIN.

Oh, they are tough as can be in their speeches, but when it comes down to their votes, they are nowhere to be found. ____________________",package_114_35.csv,9045,9045,9115,"[congressional record volume 161, number 176 (monday, december 7, 2015)] [senate] [pages s8430-s8431] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] gun violence mr. durbin. madam president, i rise to speak about the devastating impact gun violence has on our families and our communities across america. every day in america, we have a staggering amount of gun violence. on average, 297 people are shot in america each day, and 89 of them die. on a typical day, there are 31 murders and 55 suicides by gun, as well as several accidental shootings. and every day, on average, 151 americans are shot and wounded in an assault and 45 are accidently shot but survive. we have had over 350 mass shootings in america just this year, meaning incidents where at least four people are shot, and we have had over 50 incidents this year where guns have been fired at a school--50 at a school. these statistics are sobering and a call to action. most shootings in america have become so routine, they don't even make the news. sadly, many americans believe this staggering level of violence is just a normal day in america. but in recent weeks, horrific mass shootings at a planned parenthood office in colorado springs, co, and a holiday party in san bernardino have brought the issue of gun violence back into the forefront. after high-profile mass shootings, we often hear the gun lobby and their political allies say: any effort to pass a new gun law is just politicizing a tragedy. they say: we don't need any new gun laws; what we really should do is enforce the laws on the books. we saw this dynamic play out just last week. the day after the san bernardino shooting, the vast majority of senate democrats voted for an amendment by senator feinstein to close the loophole that lets suspected terrorists buy firearms in america. the vast majority of senate republicans voted no. senate democrats also voted overwhelmingly for a bipartisan amendment offered by senators manchin and toomey. this amendment would close the loopholes that allow guns to be sold without background checks either on the internet or at gun shows. again, the senate republicans overwhelmingly voted against a background check to keep firearms out of the hands of convicted felons and mentally unstable people. make no mistake--the whole world saw what happened last week in san bernardino, and the whole world now knows that people who want to commit acts of mass violence or terror in the united states sadly have easy access to an arsenal of guns. there are major loopholes in the laws on the books. this is a serious vulnerability, and americans know we need to address it. the risk of terrorist-inspired mass shootings like paris has never been higher. what are most effective ways to guard against this vulnerability? well, i thought those two amendments we considered last week were a good start. won't we agree--even those who own guns, value them, use them for sport, hunting, or self-defense--won't we agree that keeping guns out of the hands of convicted felons and mentally unstable people is the starting point? i think we should. the atf did a review of the crime guns that were seized in the highest crime areas in the city of chicago. they found out that 40 percent of the guns used in the commission of crime in some of the deadliest precincts of chicago came from northwest indiana gun shows. why? well, because you don't go through a background check if you buy from certain people at a gun show. so the thugs, the drug gangs, the drive-by shooters--all they have to do is take the skyway over the border into indiana, go to one of those gun shows, fill their trunks with guns, firearms, and ammunition, and drive back for a killing spree in chicago. there are no background checks. does that make sense? when they say, ``well, you know, it is a shame they have so much gun violence in chicago because you know they have some of the strictest laws on the books,'' well, those strict laws don't apply when you cross the state line into indiana. sadly, those laws don't apply as they should across the united states. so we called the amendment on the floor, a bipartisan amendment. patrick toomey of pennsylvania and joe manchin of west virginia-- neither one of them liberal by self-definition--have come forward and said--joe manchin said: i learned a long time ago that if you want to own a gun in west virginia, in my family, you didn't sell it to a stranger, you didn't sell it to a criminal, and you certainly didn't sell it to someone who was mentally unstable. he said that is just common sense. well, it is common sense that escaped the support and attention of the senate republicans. they voted against that provision overwhelmingly, against background checks to keep firearms out of the hands of convicted felons and those who are mentally unstable. how would you explain that? well, it might be easier to explain that than to explain the other amendment they voted against. [[page s8431]] listen to this one. if our government, in their investigation, comes up with the name of a person they believe is involved in terrorism and they put them on a no-fly list so they can't get on an airplane, guess what--they can still go to a licensed gun dealer in america and buy a firearm. these mad people in san bernardino had ar-15s, semiautomatic and automatic weapons. they weren't on a terrorist watch list that i know of or a no-fly list, but if their names had been on a list, it wouldn't have slowed them down one bit in making a purchase. so senator feinstein of california offered this amendment, an amendment which had previously been offered by the late senator lautenberg of new jersey repeatedly. senator feinstein took up his cause and brought this amendment to the floor for a vote last week in washington. i went back and looked at the congressional record to see what the objections were of the people who said they had to vote against the amendment which would say if you are on a terrorist fly list, you cannot purchase firearms or explosives in the united states. i read some of the statements that were made by the senior senator from texas. in his argument against this, he said: if you believe the federal government should be able to deprive an american citizen of one of their core constitutional rights without notice and an opportunity to be heard, then you should vote for the senator's amendment. the senator from texas continued: this is not the way we are supposed to do things in this country. if you think that the federal government never makes a mistake and that presumptively the decisions the federal government makes about putting you on a list because of some suspicions, then you should vote for this amendment. so as far as he is concerned--and i suppose those who joined him in voting against this amendment--if your name is on a terrorist watch list in america as somebody we suspect is involved in terrorism, you start off by presuming the government must be wrong and the government has to prove it. you start off, in their position, by saying that the first thing we should do is let that presumed terrorist buy a gun and then let's have a due process hearing. what? what is he thinking? if you thought there was a dangerous person in your city or your community who might engage in terrorism, would you want them to buy an assault weapon? would you want them to buy explosives? i wouldn't. let's err on the side of safety and security and say: no, if you are on that list, you cannot purchase a weapon or an explosive. if you protest being on the list and don't think you belong there, so be it. that is your right. you are entitled to a process to get your name off the list, and the feinstein amendment provides such a process. and if you prove that our government is wrong, then proceed with buying the gun or the explosives. but the presumption on the other side is that you are always entitled to buy a gun, you are always entitled to buy explosives, and if the government says otherwise, they have to prove it. it doesn't sound like a recipe for safety in america, but that is what happened on the floor of the senate. so we called this measure, and there were 45 who voted yes and 54 voted no--45 to 54 on whether someone on the terrorist watch list should be able to be prohibited from buying firearms and explosives. there has been a lot of tough talk lately about terrorism, this dozen--13, 14; i forget the number--running for president on the republican side. they are trying to out trump one another and get tougher with terrorists. yet when the moment came on the floor of the senate and the republicans in the senate--including three or four running for president--had a chance to vote to keep firearms and explosives out of the hands of suspected terrorists, they voted no. how does that make us any safer? oh, they are tough as can be in their speeches, but when it comes down to their votes, they are nowhere to be found. ____________________",9045
CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8427-6,CREC-2015-12-07,114,FIGHTING ISIS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8427-S8428] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FIGHTING ISIS Mr. REID. Mr. President, last night, President Obama spoke in stark terms about the threat terrorism poses to the United States. He detailed the extraordinary efforts our government is taking to protect Americans. He also outlined a strong plan for continuing to combat terrorism at home and abroad. President Obama is right to say the first thing Congress should do is close the loophole that lets the FBI terror suspects buy assault weapons such as those used in the San Bernardino shooting. Senate Democrats support President Obama's plan to fight ISIS and protect America. President Obama has made it clear that Democrats do not believe we should put thousands of troops on the ground in the middle of another civil war in the Middle East. But we do support the President's strategy of continuing to go after ISIS in the air with our coalition partners, targeting their leadership, oil infrastructure, and heavy weapons. We know that it must be the local forces on the ground that ultimately fight for and hold their ground because it is their land. Senate Democrats understand that the Syrian war will only be resolved diplomatically, with all parties supporting the removal of Assad. We also know that we can do more to address the threats from terrorists. That is why beginning today Senate Democrats will unveil a series of proposals to take the fight to ISIS while enhancing our protection of Americans at home. There are a few important steps we must take in order to combat ISIS's terrorism. The Democratic plan would create a new ISIS czar, one person who is fully empowered and unifies the Federal Government's efforts in fighting ISIS. We did it with Ebola. We certainly can do it with this scourge that is facing our country, ISIS. I am pleased that President Obama has taken a first step in that direction. To continue targeted airstrikes on ISIS strongholds and oil supplies and to increase support for anti-ISIS local fighters on the ground are part of the plan. We must also cut off ISIS money through new sanctions. ISIS runs its reign of terror in Iraq and Syria through extortion, oil sales, and theft. Senate Democrats' legislation imposes new sanctions--and they are tough--including a cutoff from the U.S. and international financial systems if people knowingly facilitate financial transactions with ISIS. One of the things that would help is that we have a person who has been waiting for hundreds of days to be confirmed. What is his job? He works in the Treasury Department with the State Department to stop financing of terrorism. The Republicans--for reasons totally not understood by anyone--are blocking voting on this person. The job is vacant. We also believe that we should improve intelligence training between the United States and our allies in the fight against ISIS. Some of that has started, of course. [[Page S8428]] We believe we must screen and support migrants in Europe and the Middle East. Europe is facing an unprecedented number of migrants landing on their shores, almost 1 million this year. Their screening systems have been overwhelmed by the large number of migrants. Our bill would respond to Europeans' request to provide them with technical assistance to screen migrants and improve their own border security and our security as well. In the Middle East, the Democrats' plan will help Jordan, a strong U.S. ally at the forefront of the migrant crisis. Four million people are displaced in the region, creating instability in Jordan, our ally, and also harming the neighboring countries. Democrats' legislation includes a new stabilization fund for Jordan and Lebanon, helping those fleeing the conflict in Syria stay in the region, closer to home. These are just a few of the components of our plan to degrade and destroy ISIS, but we are equally committed to thwarting terrorism here at home. The Democratic plan would close the terrorist's gun loophole. As of today, there is a legal loophole that prevents law enforcement from verifying that potential gun buyers are not FBI terror suspects. That means if a person has pledged allegiance to ISIS online and is barred from flying due to the threat they pose, that man or woman can still walk into any gunshop and purchase weapons and ammunition. They can do that today, right now. That is wrong. Last Thursday Democrats tried to pass legislation to give law enforcement the tools needed to prevent the sale of guns to suspected terrorists. Republicans blocked our commonsense measure. We are not finished. We will bring this vote to the floor as often as we can. That is the way it should be. We need to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program. It was amazing to see the Republicans running for President waffle and weasel out of why someone who is on a flight-risk status, someone who cannot fly, should be able to buy a gun. It was interesting to see on the Sunday shows the Republicans waffle and weasel through answers on this subject. We need to strengthen the Visa Waiver Program so ISIS fighters cannot access the program and travel to our country. This includes requiring visa waiver travelers to use machine-readable passports, requiring information sharing rules with visa waiver countries and requiring visa waiver countries to enter into agreements regarding the air marshal program and to comply with U.S. aviation and airport security standards. We must improve aviation security. We must work to secure our airports. We saw all the news when ISIS brought down a Russian plane with hundreds of passengers aboard. A recent report from the Homeland Security inspector general found that 73 workers with access to secure areas in airports had links to terrorism--stunning. Our legislation authorizes new vetting for aviation workers and new security measures for the most important areas of our airports. We must lock down radiological materials to stop a dirty bomb. With both ISIS and Al Qaeda saying they want to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction, it is disturbing that there are 2,300 sites around the United States with radiological material. Our legislation requires a new plan for locking down those materials at the places where they are held, such as universities and hospitals, so we can reduce the threat of a dirty bomb. Our legislation is concerned--and we are going to do everything we can--with preventing homegrown terrorists by creating an office within the Department of Homeland Security tasked with countering extremism. We must address encryption by directing the National Academy of Sciences, the intelligence community, and the private sector to work together to identify new encryption technology and how it is used to make sure that our national security needs and technology policies are not working at cross purposes. Finally, Senate Democrats are proposing legislation to provide law enforcement agencies with grant money to help prepare for active shooter situations. We know how critical first responders are to containing and ending active shooter attacks. So we should ensure they have all the tools necessary. This is the plan that we, Senate Democrats, are putting forward. It is comprehensive. It addresses international and domestic concerns. The consequences of inaction are too grave for us to waste time seeking political gain. The security of our Nation and the decimation of ISIS depend on the steps we take now. So I hope Republicans will join us to implement these logical reforms that place the security of Americans first and address the threat of ISIS around the world. Mr. President, I see no one on the floor wishing to speak. Would the Chair announce the program for the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8427-S8428] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FIGHTING ISIS Mr. REID.

[[page s8428]] we believe we must screen and support migrants in europe and the middle east. europe is facing an unprecedented number of migrants landing on their shores, almost 1 million this year. their screening systems have been overwhelmed by the large number of migrants. our bill would respond to europeans' request to provide them with technical assistance to screen migrants and improve their own border security and our security as well. in the middle east, the democrats' plan will help jordan, a strong u.s. ally at the forefront of the migrant crisis. four million people are displaced in the region, creating instability in jordan, our ally, and also harming the neighboring countries. democrats' legislation includes a new stabilization fund for jordan and lebanon, helping those fleeing the conflict in syria stay in the region, closer to home. these are just a few of the components of our plan to degrade and destroy isis, but we are equally committed to thwarting terrorism here at home. the democratic plan would close the terrorist's gun loophole. as of today, there is a legal loophole that prevents law enforcement from verifying that potential gun buyers are not fbi terror suspects. that means if a person has pledged allegiance to isis online and is barred from flying due to the threat they pose, that man or woman can still walk into any gunshop and purchase weapons and ammunition. they can do that today, right now. that is wrong. last thursday democrats tried to pass legislation to give law enforcement the tools needed to prevent the sale of guns to suspected terrorists. republicans blocked our commonsense measure. we are not finished. we will bring this vote to the floor as often as we can. that is the way it should be. we need to strengthen the visa waiver program. it was amazing to see the republicans running for president waffle and weasel out of why someone who is on a flight-risk status, someone who cannot fly, should be able to buy a gun. it was interesting to see on the sunday shows the republicans waffle and weasel through answers on this subject. we need to strengthen the visa waiver program so isis fighters cannot access the program and travel to our country. this includes requiring visa waiver travelers to use machine-readable passports, requiring information sharing rules with visa waiver countries and requiring visa waiver countries to enter into agreements regarding the air marshal program and to comply with u.s. aviation and airport security standards. we must improve aviation security. we must work to secure our airports. we saw all the news when isis brought down a russian plane with hundreds of passengers aboard. a recent report from the homeland security inspector general found that 73 workers with access to secure areas in airports had links to terrorism--stunning. our legislation authorizes new vetting for aviation workers and new security measures for the most important areas of our airports. we must lock down radiological materials to stop a dirty bomb. with both isis and al qaeda saying they want to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction, it is disturbing that there are 2,300 sites around the united states with radiological material. our legislation requires a new plan for locking down those materials at the places where they are held, such as universities and hospitals, so we can reduce the threat of a dirty bomb. our legislation is concerned--and we are going to do everything we can--with preventing homegrown terrorists by creating an office within the department of homeland security tasked with countering extremism. we must address encryption by directing the national academy of sciences, the intelligence community, and the private sector to work together to identify new encryption technology and how it is used to make sure that our national security needs and technology policies are not working at cross purposes. finally, senate democrats are proposing legislation to provide law enforcement agencies with grant money to help prepare for active shooter situations. we know how critical first responders are to containing and ending active shooter attacks. so we should ensure they have all the tools necessary. this is the plan that we, senate democrats, are putting forward. it is comprehensive. it addresses international and domestic concerns. the consequences of inaction are too grave for us to waste time seeking political gain. the security of our nation and the decimation of isis depend on the steps we take now. so i hope republicans will join us to implement these logical reforms that place the security of americans first and address the threat of isis around the world. mr. president, i see no one on the floor wishing to speak. would the chair announce the program for the day. ____________________",7884

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8431,CREC-2015-12-07,114,REFUGEES,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8431-S8432] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REFUGEES Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there is also a question about what we can do to keep our country safe in terms of people coming into our country. Each year we admit about 70,000 refugees from all over the world. The No. 1 country providing refugees to the United States--Burma. Most people wouldn't have guessed that. About one-fourth of our refugees come from Burma. How do they get into the United States as refugees? They are first identified by the United Nations Council on Refugees, and then they start a process, a background check and process. This goes on for 18 months to 24 months. It involves repetitive fingerprinting and checking, interviews, examinations, questions. Then, finally, after 24 months, they may be allowed to come to the United States as a refugee. About 70,000 a year come into our country. I have met a lot of them. They are from all over the world--Africa, Asia, all over the world. And now we have a focus on them, a laserlike focus on them. Some are arguing that the way to keep America safe is to stop refugees from coming in from Syria. Well, we know Syria has been engaged in a civil war for more than 4 years. We know some 4 million people have been displaced. I was in Greece a few weeks back and saw numbers coming across the Aegean Sea from Turkey into Greece. These Syrian and some Iraqi refugees are desperate people. You literally see a family walking--mother, father, carrying babies, walking toddlers-- with all that they own on their backs. That is it. We stopped to talk to some of them, and they told the story of what it was like to live in Syria amidst a civil war, what it was like to have barrel bombs going off in your town--the damage that it did, the killing that it did. Many of them had lost members of their families. They were running away from that violence--not only from Assad, the head of Syria, but from ISIL as well. Some of them decide to ask to become refugees in the United States. They know that if they ask, they are in for a long, long haul--18 to 24 months. Some have made it, fewer than 2,000, during the last 4 years. Some have made it. Not a single Syrian refugee coming into the United States since this war began has ever been charged with terrorism. It just hasn't happened. What happens with other visitors to the United States? Well, we welcome visitors. Certainly we do. Many of us look forward to visiting their countries too. About 55 million foreign travelers come to the United States each year; about 20 million are from visa waiver countries--38 countries where we have a special relationship and say: You don't need a specific visa to come to our country because we have this agreement between us; you may freely travel to the United States on what we call a visa waiver. That is about 20 million of the 55 million. We can do better when it comes to these visitors on both sides-- Americans traveling overseas and foreigners coming into this country. We need to make sure that before a person gets on a plane, we check their fingerprints, for example. That is a pretty easy thing to do these days. Just put your hands down; it reads them and cross-checks against the data bank of suspected people, suspected criminals, and suspected terrorists. Obviously, the overwhelming majority of people will have no problem whatsoever, but it is a way, just like taking off your shoes, to make sure that we are safer. It is a little inconvenient but worth it. What we have said on the Democratic side is that if you want to make America safe--and we all do--it is far better to focus on foreign travelers and visa waivers, and make sure we are doing the proper checks before the person gets on the airplane. I believe we should do that. When I travel to their countries, I am prepared to face the same fingerprint check. It is not too much to ask in the 21st century, with the terrorism and violence that we face. All these things will make us safer, but focusing on 70,000 refugees, among which a few hundred are Syrian, instead of looking at the larger group of 55 million foreign travelers--did you know that most of the terrorists in Paris, France, were carrying European passports which would have allowed them to come to the United States without a visa? So if we want to make our country safer--and I do--let's do things that are practical and thoughtful. [[Page S8432]] Incidentally, those who come to the United States on visa waivers from 38 countries around the world can currently legally buy firearms. What is that all about? Our law prevents foreign visitors who come in on a visa from buying firearms, but a loophole allows those who qualify under the Visa Waiver Program to come as visitors to buy a firearm. I think we can do better there as well. Let's tighten up the Visa Waiver Program, and make sure we do the proper checks so dangerous people don't ever get on the plane to come to the United States. Let's make sure as well that if you have a visa waiver and you come to the United States as a visitor, you are not going to be purchasing firearms. Finally, if you are on a suspected terrorist no-fly list, you should be disqualified from buying a gun or an explosive, period. Those are three practical steps. I think we ought to move forward and do that on a bipartisan basis. It will be something to keep in mind and make America much safer. In closing, some of the suggestions being made as these Republican Presidential candidates try to out-trump one another are very sad. They reflect the ignorance of history and a willingness to ignore the values of this country. When I hear some of the awful things being said about people of the Islamic faith--I think about a dinner I went to Saturday night. It was in Chicago; it was by the Children's Heart Research Foundation. They were saluting a number of doctors in the Chicago area who were extraordinary in saving the lives of children. One of them is a current surgeon. He started with Children's Memorial Hospital; he is now with the Advocate hospital system. He is considered to be the best in Chicago. If your baby--and 1 out of 100 are--is born with a congenital heart defect, this is the doctor you want to see the child; this is the surgeon you want to save your child's life. This doctor is a Muslim. He is an American. He is an important part of America. Those who are making negative statements about all people in the Islamic faith, calling for registration or exclusion or whatever it may be-- their statements and views are not consistent with who we are as Americans. The President said as much last night, and I agree. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8431-S8432] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REFUGEES Mr. DURBIN.

[[page s8432]] incidentally, those who come to the united states on visa waivers from 38 countries around the world can currently legally buy firearms. what is that all about? our law prevents foreign visitors who come in on a visa from buying firearms, but a loophole allows those who qualify under the visa waiver program to come as visitors to buy a firearm. i think we can do better there as well. let's tighten up the visa waiver program, and make sure we do the proper checks so dangerous people don't ever get on the plane to come to the united states. let's make sure as well that if you have a visa waiver and you come to the united states as a visitor, you are not going to be purchasing firearms. finally, if you are on a suspected terrorist no-fly list, you should be disqualified from buying a gun or an explosive, period. those are three practical steps. i think we ought to move forward and do that on a bipartisan basis. it will be something to keep in mind and make america much safer. in closing, some of the suggestions being made as these republican presidential candidates try to out-trump one another are very sad. they reflect the ignorance of history and a willingness to ignore the values of this country. when i hear some of the awful things being said about people of the islamic faith--i think about a dinner i went to saturday night. it was in chicago; it was by the children's heart research foundation. they were saluting a number of doctors in the chicago area who were extraordinary in saving the lives of children. one of them is a current surgeon. he started with children's memorial hospital; he is now with the advocate hospital system. he is considered to be the best in chicago. if your baby--and 1 out of 100 are--is born with a congenital heart defect, this is the doctor you want to see the child; this is the surgeon you want to save your child's life. this doctor is a muslim. he is an american. he is an important part of america. those who are making negative statements about all people in the islamic faith, calling for registration or exclusion or whatever it may be-- their statements and views are not consistent with who we are as americans. the president said as much last night, and i agree. madam president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",7148
CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8428-3,CREC-2015-12-07,114,FAST ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8428-S8429] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAST ACT Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the tremendous work that has been done over the course of this year to pass a bipartisan, 5-year, $305 billion highway bill, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, known as the FAST Act. Transportation infrastructure is an essential part of the U.S. economy. It serves as the foundation to support our country's economic global competitiveness and connects communities, people, and markets. Federal investment in transportation and other infrastructure has, unfortunately, lagged in recent decades, with public expenditures on infrastructure as a percentage of GDP steadily declining to its lowest levels in 20 years. I have consistently called for a highway bill that ensures steady and reliable funding for States so they can make long- term plans for improving our crumbling infrastructure. For too long, stopgap measures to prop up the highway trust fund for just a few months at a time have failed to provide the stability necessary to grow our economy. The FAST Act comes at a critical time. This legislation will improve our Nation's infrastructure, make our Federal surface transportation programs work better for States, and address our Nation's infrastructure priorities by focusing on critical commerce corridors and emerging freight corridors as well. The FAST Act also makes key investments in something I am very passionate about, and that is the future of mobility in the United States. Today, the auto industry is working hand in hand with tech, telecom, and software companies and their partners in academia and Federal agencies to collaborate and contribute to the transportation system of the future. This future will be dominated by connected and autonomous vehicles--on-demand services such as ride-sharing and car- sharing--and innovations in vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Vehicle-to-infrastructure communications technologies--known as V2I-- have the potential to deliver incredible safety, mobility, environmental, and operational benefits to the driving public. For example, V2I technologies will allow bridges that are icing up to be able to communicate directly with an automobile before it gets to the bridge and, as a result, will prevent an accident before it even occurs. Today, stakeholders are working to develop and test V2I technologies, and widespread deployment is expected in the coming years. We have to make sure the States are making plans for their future in V2I technologies. That is why I introduced [[Page S8429]] legislation earlier this year with Senators Stabenow and Blunt that promotes investment in vehicle-to-infrastructure technology by authorizing States to use existing surface and highway transportation funding to invest in V2I projects as they upgrade their highway infrastructure. It is called the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Safety Technology Investment Flexibility Act of 2015, and today I am proud to say this legislation passed as part of the FAST Act. My vehicle-to-infrastructure provision and the broader bill's other major investments in research and development represent the type of forward-thinking policymaking on which Congress should be focused. By committing now to help usher in the future of mobility and by providing the funding and time to execute these programs, we have the ability to transform our society for the better. The FAST Act also contains several provisions to improve rail safety in the United States. I am pleased that legislation I authored, in the wake of the devastating Amtrak No. 188 crash earlier this year in Philadelphia that unfortunately took the lives of 8 people and injured over 200, was included in the FAST Act. My provision requires the Department of Transportation, Amtrak, and the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct a post-accident assessment of the Amtrak No. 188 crash to determine if Amtrak followed its emergency preparedness and family assistance response plans and to determine if and how these plans can be improved for the future. Finally, the FAST Act reauthorizes the Export-Import Bank. Since the beginning of July, the jobs supported by the Ex-Im Bank have been unnecessarily jeopardized. The Ex-Im Bank helps level the playing field for American companies in a tough global market. Last year it supported more than $27.4 billion in U.S. exports and 164,000 jobs. More than $10 billion of that total--nearly 40 percent--represented exports by small businesses, and 90 percent of its overall transactions directly supported small businesses, including many that serve as suppliers for large companies. In Michigan, for example, the Ex-Im Bank has supported 229 exporter businesses selling $11 billion worth of goods to places such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Canada. This support is particularly important for our manufacturing industry, and the majority of Michigan exporters using Ex-Im Bank are manufacturers of motor vehicles and parts, machinery and chemicals--basically the backbone of Michigan's economy. I am proud to see that with the FAST Act's passage, we can get back to the business of doing what makes sense for the economy and for jobs in America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, while my colleague from Michigan is here, let me say that we appreciate so much his participation in the commerce committee, especially the expertise he brings to the table with regard to all things automotive since, in fact, his State is the automotive State. He is a valued member of our commerce committee. I thank the Senator from Michigan. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8428-S8429] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAST ACT Mr. PETERS.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8429,CREC-2015-12-07,114,FIGHTING ISIS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8429-S8430] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FIGHTING ISIS Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, Americans are understandably frightened by the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. As we mourn the loss of the victims, our hearts go out to their friends and families. We were shocked 14 years ago, on September 11, when foreign terrorists struck our homeland. For the first time, two big oceans did not protect us from foreign terrorists. Now we know we have to be prepared to meet the threat not only abroad but here at home. First, that means we have to see the threat clearly. It doesn't just come from shadowy foreign terrorist groups such as ISIS or Al Qaeda; now we see that it comes from a lone wolf or wolves, individuals who get radicalized. We saw that in the case at Fort Hood. We have seen it in other cases. We saw it in the case that was averted in Times Square, from someone who had come all the way across the country. They are extremely hard to detect. Of course, ISIS uses the Internet to spread its propaganda, its influence, and to try to inspire disaffected young people with its propaganda far beyond where ISIS is located over in the Middle East. That means we have to use all the tools at our disposal to collect actionable intelligence, harden our defenses, counter radicalization, counter propaganda, and stiffen our resolve. We ought to ensure that terrorists can't exploit the Visa Waiver Program. There are 38 countries with which we share this visa waiver. We ought to ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the access they need to the terrorists' electronic communications to disrupt the attacks--that is a big order--all the while protecting Americans' privacy and constitutional rights. That is why this Senator thinks it was a mistake to change the previous law, as we did earlier this year, which allowed telecom business bulk records to be readily accessed to trace terrorist communications. We have done this. We do not have the ready access of those bulk business records. Again, I remind our listeners we are not talking about the contents of communications--telephone calls or content of the Internet messages. We are talking about the bulk records which are business records that such and such a number or such and such an IP address on such and such a date transmitted a message to another number or another IP address. In the past, through a court order, those bulk records were held by the NSA, granting ready access so that if we were trying to stop a terrorist by getting intel ahead of time, we could go back and see where those communications were and with whom and how many hops it had gone in order to try to break up the terrorist activity. The problem with the lone wolf is that if they are disguising their operations, they are not communicating with anybody. That is why it makes it so much more difficult to intercept the lone wolf who has been inspired by ISIS. Recently we saw that ISIS has claimed the responsibility for the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt, and it reminds us that our planes and airports remain a target for terror attacks. That is why I am introducing, and will explain tomorrow, legislation to tighten internal security at airports across the country. We had some good examples of that a year ago in Atlanta. Unbelievably, for several months, guns were brought into the Atlanta airport by airport workers, were transferred to a passenger who had already gone through TSA security, and they were actually transported over a number of months from Atlanta to New York. It is the lack of security on the perimeter of allowing workers into the airport proper that needs to be tightened up at all of our 300 airports. Two have already done that over the last several years, and I am very proud of the Miami airport and the Orlando airport that they have done it and done it very successfully. Because ISIS exploits war in Syria and the instability and sectarian conflict in Iraq, meeting the terrorist threat means the use of military force as well. With the help of our coalition partners, as we speak, our forces are striking ISIS from the air and training local forces to fight ISIS on the ground. We are intensifying airstrikes against ISIS leadership, against heavy weapons, against oil tankers and oil wells, and have recently deployed U.S. Special Operations forces to help local forces build the necessary battlefield momentum to take back territory. Special Operations forces will be central to the fight in order to avoid the large-scale deployment of U.S. ground forces. These forces are trained to conduct surgical strikes against terrorist leaders. There are press reports that GEN Joseph Votel, the current commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, in the next year will become the next commander of Central Command, responsible for operations against ISIS. He already works side by side with General Austin--the commander of U.S. Central Command in Tampa at MacDill Air Force Base--and he will bring tremendous experience to the job. The Congress is not doing our job. We should authorize the use of military force. It is our responsibility. I believe the President has the responsibility to fight ISIS in Iraq or Syria or wherever, but the unity of the Congress backing the President in law is constitutionally [[Page S8430]] required. We ought to debate these proposals and vote. The authorization would show the world that the United States is united in defeating ISIS. The military fight is one piece of a broader effort to destroy ISIS and bring about a political transition in Syria to a government where finally Bashar al-Assad will have finally left. That is critical to ending the war, ending the resulting humanitarian crisis, and stemming the flow of the refugees. Our efforts will take time and commitment, but they are clearly necessary to protect our national security. This is going to be a long, hard war. We can't do it overnight. There has been success in the war effort. We brought together 65 nations. Twelve thousand terrorist fighters have been killed. We have shrunk the territory ISIS occupies and has sanctuary. I want to show the Senate this map. It has been shown before. It is not classified. All the area in green is what ISIS used to occupy, along with the area in orange--there along the Euphrates River. All of that area in green ISIS occupied but no longer does because of the coalition efforts. There has been success. Someone needs to talk about that success. Going forward, we are going to have to use more Special Operations troops. We are going to have to insist on our Arab neighbors picking up the fight and doing the fighting on the ground, and we do not need to make the mistake of tens of thousands of Americans on the ground because that plays right into ISIS's hands because it looks like--and ISIS would portray it as--it is the United States versus Muslims. We should treat Muslims with respect here at home in America; treat them with the respect they deserve. Don't overreact. Otherwise that plays to ISIS's advantage of the image of Americans; in other words, it is us versus them. We are accelerating the fight. We have more and more intense coalition partners. We have extensive intel sharing. We have an outreach to Muslims about the truth of ISIS, and we insist our partners share their intel with us. That includes the visa waiver of those 38 nations. Fear at this time--like San Bernardino--is a natural response. It happens at times such as this, but we cannot let fear get the best of us. We must overcome the fear and not let it compromise who we are as Americans by overreacting. We need to nail down a truth that our government has no greater obligation than to keep us safe.

Isn't it time to remember that Latin phrase that is up there above the President's desk, ``e pluribus unum''--out of many, one. It is time to come together. God bless America.

Mr. President, Americans are understandably frightened by the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. As we mourn the loss of the victims, our hearts go out to their friends and families. We were shocked 14 years ago, on September 11, when foreign terrorists struck our homeland. For the first time, two big oceans did not protect us from foreign terrorists. Now we know we have to be prepared to meet the threat not only abroad but here at home. First, that means we have to see the threat clearly. It doesn't just come from shadowy foreign terrorist groups such as ISIS or Al Qaeda; now we see that it comes from a lone wolf or wolves, individuals who get radicalized. We saw that in the case at Fort Hood. We have seen it in other cases. We saw it in the case that was averted in Times Square, from someone who had come all the way across the country. They are extremely hard to detect. Of course, ISIS uses the Internet to spread its propaganda, its influence, and to try to inspire disaffected young people with its propaganda far beyond where ISIS is located over in the Middle East. That means we have to use all the tools at our disposal to collect actionable intelligence, harden our defenses, counter radicalization, counter propaganda, and stiffen our resolve. We ought to ensure that terrorists can't exploit the Visa Waiver Program. There are 38 countries with which we share this visa waiver. We ought to ensure that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the access they need to the terrorists' electronic communications to disrupt the attacks--that is a big order--all the while protecting Americans' privacy and constitutional rights. That is why this Senator thinks it was a mistake to change the previous law, as we did earlier this year, which allowed telecom business bulk records to be readily accessed to trace terrorist communications. We have done this. We do not have the ready access of those bulk business records. Again, I remind our listeners we are not talking about the contents of communications--telephone calls or content of the Internet messages. We are talking about the bulk records which are business records that such and such a number or such and such an IP address on such and such a date transmitted a message to another number or another IP address. In the past, through a court order, those bulk records were held by the NSA, granting ready access so that if we were trying to stop a terrorist by getting intel ahead of time, we could go back and see where those communications were and with whom and how many hops it had gone in order to try to break up the terrorist activity. The problem with the lone wolf is that if they are disguising their operations, they are not communicating with anybody. That is why it makes it so much more difficult to intercept the lone wolf who has been inspired by ISIS. Recently we saw that ISIS has claimed the responsibility for the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt, and it reminds us that our planes and airports remain a target for terror attacks. That is why I am introducing, and will explain tomorrow, legislation to tighten internal security at airports across the country. We had some good examples of that a year ago in Atlanta. Unbelievably, for several months, guns were brought into the Atlanta airport by airport workers, were transferred to a passenger who had already gone through TSA security, and they were actually transported over a number of months from Atlanta to New York. It is the lack of security on the perimeter of allowing workers into the airport proper that needs to be tightened up at all of our 300 airports. Two have already done that over the last several years, and I am very proud of the Miami airport and the Orlando airport that they have done it and done it very successfully. Because ISIS exploits war in Syria and the instability and sectarian conflict in Iraq, meeting the terrorist threat means the use of military force as well. With the help of our coalition partners, as we speak, our forces are striking ISIS from the air and training local forces to fight ISIS on the ground. We are intensifying airstrikes against ISIS leadership, against heavy weapons, against oil tankers and oil wells, and have recently deployed U.S. Special Operations forces to help local forces build the necessary battlefield momentum to take back territory. Special Operations forces will be central to the fight in order to avoid the large-scale deployment of U.S. ground forces. These forces are trained to conduct surgical strikes against terrorist leaders. There are press reports that GEN Joseph Votel, the current commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, in the next year will become the next commander of Central Command, responsible for operations against ISIS. He already works side by side with General Austin--the commander of U.S. Central Command in Tampa at MacDill Air Force Base--and he will bring tremendous experience to the job. The Congress is not doing our job. We should authorize the use of military force. It is our responsibility. I believe the President has the responsibility to fight ISIS in Iraq or Syria or wherever, but the unity of the Congress backing the President in law is constitutionally [[Page S8430]] required. We ought to debate these proposals and vote. The authorization would show the world that the United States is united in defeating ISIS. The military fight is one piece of a broader effort to destroy ISIS and bring about a political transition in Syria to a government where finally Bashar al-Assad will have finally left. That is critical to ending the war, ending the resulting humanitarian crisis, and stemming the flow of the refugees. Our efforts will take time and commitment, but they are clearly necessary to protect our national security. This is going to be a long, hard war. We can't do it overnight.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8432-3,CREC-2015-12-07,114,PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8432-S8433] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIL Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, last evening President Obama addressed the Nation concerning the threat ISIL poses to our people. Unfortunately, the American people did not hear of a strategy or a plan to defeat and destroy this terrorist army. Instead, they heard a restatement of a military campaign crafted to contain--contain--ISIL within Iraq and Syria. Following the attacks in Paris and California, and the downing of a Russian airliner, about 60 percent of the American people disapprove of the President's handling of terrorism. Nearly two-thirds disapprove of his handling of ISIL. The American people understand intuitively that ISIL and the wider terrorist threat have not been contained but, rather, that they have evolved into something increasingly more serious and more challenging. Americans also know that the operational concept ordered by the President is insufficient to defeat ISIL. It is not just the American people saying this. It is not just Republicans saying it, either. President Obama's last Defense Secretary recently criticized his approach; so have several other former Obama administration officials. Here is a sampling of what they have said over just the last week or two: One called on the Obama administration to ``wake up'' to the threat. Another said that the Obama administration ``seems to be really flailing and tone deaf to this latest challenge.'' A third called on the President to ``change your strategy'' because ``by any measure, our strategy in Iraq and Syria is not succeeding.'' And then there is President Obama's former Secretary of State, Secretary Clinton, who put it plainly: ``We're not winning.'' Hillary Clinton said: ``We're not winning.'' The President had a real opportunity last night to show the American people that defeating ISIL is his priority. He had an opportunity to demonstrate his willingness to adapt to the threat. He had an opportunity to explain how he can better prepare our Nation for a fight that will inevitably be passed on to his successor, but he didn't do that. He didn't do it last night. The American people were looking for a serious strategy and a real vision last night, not a recap of an approach that clearly hasn't worked. Last night was only the President's third Oval Office address, and by any measure a missed opportunity. Look, throughout his time as Commander in Chief, President Obama has shown an inflexible adherence to policies he advocated as a candidate for office in 2008, most specifically to end our Nation's War on Terror. In his first days in office he issued a series of Executive orders designed to weaken the ability of our warfighter and intelligence community to gather targeted information, to capture terrorists, interrogate, and detain them to advance our understanding of terrorist networks and plans, as well as to protect the American people. Although the President conceded that the complete withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan would be harmful to our national security interests and slowed our withdrawal in the face of Al Qaeda and Taliban resistance, he inflexibly clung to a fixed date for our drawdown of forces in Iraq, which allowed for the growth of ISIL. As the President inflexibly pursued an end to the War on Terror, the terrorist threat evolved and adapted as Al Qaeda affiliates advanced in presence and capability and Al Qaeda in Iraq grew into the terrorist army we now know as ISIL. ISIL's use of social media and encrypted communications burgeoned at the very moment the President and his allies were working to take away critical electronic surveillance tools from our intelligence community. Here is what we need from the President now. What we need from the President is for him to clearly outline what it is he aims to achieve, how he aims to achieve it, and what authorities he thinks he will need to make that happen. He needs to match strategic objectives to the means to reach the goals. The President needs to tell us what authorities he needs to defeat encrypted online communications. The President needs to tell us what is needed to establish our capture, interrogation, and surveillance capabilities. The President needs to tell us how the coalition or NATO will forge a ground force capable of not only trying to contain ISIL but actually driving it from Raqqa. The President needs to tell us the force structure and the funding our commanders will need to rebuild our conventional capabilities so we can continue and expand this fight while facing other global threats. The President should also explain why he will not use the secure facility at Guantanamo Bay to safely hold and interrogate newly captured terrorists in order to help prevent the next plot against Americans. These are the kinds of things the American people are looking for, and by leading on them, President Obama [[Page S8433]] can demonstrate his commitment to protecting our Nation and leaving it better prepared for his successor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8432-S8433] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIL Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, on another matter, last November the American people elected a new Congress to get Washington working again. Nearly every day seems to bring more signs that we are. Over the weekend, President Obama signed the FAST Act, a multiyear highway bill, into law. It represents a significant departure from years of short- term extensions and congressional inaction. In fact, the FAST Act is the longest term highway bill to pass Congress in almost two decades, providing 5 full years of highway funding. Here is what Kentuckians for Better Transportation--a top transportation advocacy organization in my State--had to say about it: After many, many years of short term continuing resolutions we finally have a long term authorization that will give our states the opportunity to plan for and implement major road projects. . . . We can [now] plan for the future. That is because in a new and more open Senate, Senator Inhofe, a Republican, and Senator Boxer, a Democrat, were able to work together for its passage. Senator Boxer herself called it ``a major accomplishment.'' Here is another major accomplishment: the Every Student Succeeds Act. It is a bipartisan, reformist replacement for No Child Left Behind. Pundits in Washington could never agree on how to replace No Child Left Behind. The issue went unresolved for many years, but in a new and more open Senate, Senator Alexander, a Republican, and Senator Murray, a Democrat, worked hard and found success in the bill before us. The House already passed it, 359 to 64. The Senate previously passed a very similar version of the bill, 81 to 17. Tomorrow we should work together to pass it for a second and final time and send it to the President for his signature. It will be the latest important achievement for the American people from a new Congress that is back to work and back on their side. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8433-3,CREC-2015-12-07,114,SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8433-S8435] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we are on the downward trajectory of this year's Congress, the 114th Congress, and I thought it would be appropriate to take a few minutes to talk about what this Chamber has been able to accomplish since we convened in January. I know there is a lot of cynicism and indeed outright fear about the way the Federal Government has been operating, and unfortunately I think a lot of that is attributable to the fact that this President has shown a complete unwillingness to work with Congress in many areas; for example, such as immigration reform. So when people see the President acting unilaterally--thank goodness the courts have stopped it, [[Page S8434]] but it causes them to lose confidence in the Federal Government's ability to address the problems they live with day in and day out and which they have a right to see us do our very best to address. I can't help but think about this time last year and how, with great anticipation and high expectations, the American people decided to give our side of the aisle, the Republican side, the opportunity to serve in the majority. Our task was a daunting one. The Senate had basically been ground to a halt, and I think Members on both sides of the aisle came back in January ready to change the way we do things around here. I think some of our friends across the aisle found that the do-nothing strategy didn't work for them either, even though they were in the majority, because a number of Senate incumbents--having to face the voters without anything to show--ended up being defeated in last November's election. It didn't work for the American people. So it didn't work for the American people, and it didn't work for those Senators. As I said, the American people deserve better. We tried to do better, and I think we have made some progress. We have been getting a few things done, delivering on promises made to the American people and working to find real solutions to the problems faced by those whom we are honored to represent. One of those areas that has been particularly important to me is doing something about an issue that plagues every State in our country; that is, human trafficking. At the beginning of last year, I was honored to lead a bipartisan effort to pass legislation designed to help victims of human trafficking get a helping hand and hopefully find a path to healing. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which is now the law of the land, will help these victims, who are too often children, be treated like the victims they are instead of common criminals. After about a month on the floor of the Senate, that bill ultimately ended up passing, 99 to 0, and it was signed into law by the President. It points out that the Congress can work with the President on a bipartisan basis to fight some of the most tragic and troubling issues that face our Nation. There are other examples. In the fall we passed a major cyber security bill that will help protect the American people from cyber attacks. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act fosters information sharing to help address the growing cyber threats we face. Of course we read about them in the news, if we haven't experienced them in person ourselves. The need for this legislation couldn't have been more pressing because over the summer the administration confirmed that hackers had accessed sensitive background information of more than 21 million people on the computer systems of the Office of Personnel Management--21 million Americans. That followed a similar breach at the Internal Revenue Service in which the personal data of more than 100,000 taxpayers was stolen. So passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act was the right thing to do, and it was done on a bipartisan basis. We are now engaged in a conference discussion with the House to try to reconcile the differences between those bills before it goes to the President. That is the way we ought to be doing business around here--trying to find solutions that make America stronger and make our cyber infrastructure more resilient. Another example was from last week. Last week we passed a multiyear highway bill for the first time in more than a decade. My State is blessed to be a fast-growing State, and of course that has encouraged a lot of people to move there--voting with their feet, as I like to say, and coming from places where jobs aren't being produced because the economy is not growing. This bill helps Texas on the State and local level to prepare for those growing infrastructure needs that come with this increased growth. Just as significantly, it will help the rest of the country as well by creating jobs to build and maintain that infrastructure as well as the commerce that travels on that infrastructure and the environment which will be served by avoiding unnecessary congestion. This bill also specifically grants States like Texas the flexibility to invest in infrastructure projects--in our case, along the border. We have a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico. It is a unique part of our country. I like to kid my constituents back home. I say: What most of my colleagues in Washington know about the border they read in novels or saw in a movie somewhere. It is a unique and wonderful part of our State, but it is also one that deserves our undivided attention because of the security threats, drug trafficking, and other illegal activity. It is no small thing for the Nation's top exporting State, one that shares almost 1,200 miles with Mexico, to be able to direct some of these funds to help build and maintain that infrastructure. By the way, I know people frequently talk about Mexico and our relationship with Mexico in a negative way, but we also understand there are enormous benefits to our proximity to Mexico and our shared border. There are about 6 million jobs in America that depend on binational trade with Mexico. While Mexico has its problems--and they certainly have serious problems--we are working with them on their security and corruption issues and the like. It will take all of our efforts in order to address them. By promoting better border infrastructure, Texas can build on our strong trade record, which already includes the export of more than $100 billion in goods to Mexico each year and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs--6 million jobs nationwide. This multiyear highway bill will also give Texas and other States across the country more certainty. Before this we had been looking at temporary patches, which makes it impossible to plan, and it also makes the expenditure of those dollars enormously inefficient. This bill gives us greater certainty to make sure our States can deliver projects to facilitate greater volumes of trade and travel along interstates and other critical transportation corridors. An area where we have not yet achieved success but where I think there is great promise--there are other areas, such as criminal justice reform, where I believe we can in the months ahead register another success, again for the benefit of the people we represent. Last week, at the President's invitation, I joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of legislators to come to the White House to discuss a way forward for bringing substantive criminal justice reform to our country. For too long, in my State we learned that we treated prisons like warehouses, warehousing people and ignoring the fact--or perhaps just not recognizing the significance of the fact--that sooner or later most of them were going to get out of prison. So what we decided to do in Texas in 2007 was to get smart on crime, not just tough on crime. Nobody doubted how tough we were on crime. But what we realized is that some of the money we spent on corrections could be plowed back into educational programs that would help willing inmates actually learn job skills, deal with their drug and alcohol problems, if they had those, and, in short, better prepare for life on the outside so they didn't end up a frequent flyer or in that turnstile, going from prison to the outside and then back again. So we have been working on this issue for some time, based on the success we enjoyed in Texas and in other States. The product is a bill called the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 15 to 5. I know Chairman Goodlatte in the House of Representatives is working on a bipartisan bill in that Chamber as well. So I think this is one of those pivotal moments where folks across the political spectrum see the advantage of working together in favor of bringing real progress that will benefit the American people by making our criminal justice system more effective and our communities safer. By the way, we can save money at the same time. On another matter where we have seen significant progress, this week we will be voting on the conference report that accompanies the Every Child Achieves Act. This is the bill that actually fixes No Child Left Behind. This legislation was passed here in the Senate by wide margins over the summer. Chairman Alexander and the conference committee and Ranking Member Murray were able to achieve an [[Page S8435]] amazing thing in this divided, polarized political environment we are in, with, I believe, a 39-to-1 vote in the conference committee for a bill that combines both the House and the Senate product. This is really landmark education legislation that will help parents and local communities take control of their children's education instead of ceding to the Federal Government. Certainly, this bill is another win for the American people. Where I come from, people like the fact that we essentially have repealed the common core mandate, that we have eliminated the Federal Government as a national school board, and that we have sent the power back where it belongs, which is to parents and teachers and local school districts, and ceded more of that authority from here in Washington, DC, back to them. I could continue with this list of legislative accomplishments by noting that the Chamber has also passed legislation that replaced the flawed Medicare payment system for physicians. This is the notorious doc fix. This is another example where for years and years we passed temporary patches and never solved the underlying problem. But Congress did, and I think that is another thing we can be proud of, along with the first budget passed since 2009, and there is more I could add to the list. But my point is there is a difference in the new 114th Congress, and elections do make a difference. We have worked together on a bipartisan basis where we can to make progress to solve problems for the American people during this first year of the 114th Congress. A lot of this is due to the steady leadership of the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, and all the hard work our colleagues have put in to make this such a productive year. So we are on track to continue with this momentum into the new year, and with just another week or so of work to do before we break for the holidays, I think we can take some pride in these accomplishments but yet know that there is a lot more we have to do, not only for the remainder of this year but into next year as well. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8433-S8435] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS Mr. CORNYN.

We have been getting a few things done, delivering on promises made to the American people and working to find real solutions to the problems faced by those whom we are honored to represent. One of those areas that has been particularly important to me is doing something about an issue that plagues every State in our country; that is, human trafficking. At the beginning of last year, I was honored to lead a bipartisan effort to pass legislation designed to help victims of human trafficking get a helping hand and hopefully find a path to healing. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which is now the law of the land, will help these victims, who are too often children, be treated like the victims they are instead of common criminals. After about a month on the floor of the Senate, that bill ultimately ended up passing, 99 to 0, and it was signed into law by the President. It points out that the Congress can work with the President on a bipartisan basis to fight some of the most tragic and troubling issues that face our Nation. There are other examples. In the fall we passed a major cyber security bill that will help protect the American people from cyber attacks. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act fosters information sharing to help address the growing cyber threats we face. Of course we read about them in the news, if we haven't experienced them in person ourselves. The need for this legislation couldn't have been more pressing because over the summer the administration confirmed that hackers had accessed sensitive background information of more than 21 million people on the computer systems of the Office of Personnel Management--21 million Americans. That followed a similar breach at the Internal Revenue Service in which the personal data of more than 100,000 taxpayers was stolen. So passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act was the right thing to do, and it was done on a bipartisan basis. We are now engaged in a conference discussion with the House to try to reconcile the differences between those bills before it goes to the President. That is the way we ought to be doing business around here--trying to find solutions that make America stronger and make our cyber infrastructure more resilient. Another example was from last week. Last week we passed a multiyear highway bill for the first time in more than a decade. My State is blessed to be a fast-growing State, and of course that has encouraged a lot of people to move there--voting with their feet, as I like to say, and coming from places where jobs aren't being produced because the economy is not growing. This bill helps Texas on the State and local level to prepare for those growing infrastructure needs that come with this increased growth. Just as significantly, it will help the rest of the country as well by creating jobs to build and maintain that infrastructure as well as the commerce that travels on that infrastructure and the environment which will be served by avoiding unnecessary congestion. This bill also specifically grants States like Texas the flexibility to invest in infrastructure projects--in our case, along the border. We have a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico. It is a unique part of our country. I like to kid my constituents back home. I say: What most of my colleagues in Washington know about the border they read in novels or saw in a movie somewhere. It is a unique and wonderful part of our State, but it is also one that deserves our undivided attention because of the security threats, drug trafficking, and other illegal activity. It is no small thing for the Nation's top exporting State, one that shares almost 1,200 miles with Mexico, to be able to direct some of these funds to help build and maintain that infrastructure. By the way, I know people frequently talk about Mexico and our relationship with Mexico in a negative way, but we also understand there are enormous benefits to our proximity to Mexico and our shared border. There are about 6 million jobs in America that depend on binational trade with Mexico. While Mexico has its problems--and they certainly have serious problems--we are working with them on their security and corruption issues and the like. It will take all of our efforts in order to address them. By promoting better border infrastructure, Texas can build on our strong trade record, which already includes the export of more than $100 billion in goods to Mexico each year and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs--6 million jobs nationwide. This multiyear highway bill will also give Texas and other States across the country more certainty. Before this we had been looking at temporary patches, which makes it impossible to plan, and it also makes the expenditure of those dollars enormously inefficient. This bill gives us greater certainty to make sure our States can deliver projects to facilitate greater volumes of trade and travel along interstates and other critical transportation corridors. An area where we have not yet achieved success but where I think there is great promise--there are other areas, such as criminal justice reform, where I believe we can in the months ahead register another success, again for the benefit of the people we represent. Last week, at the President's invitation, I joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of legislators to come to the White House to discuss a way forward for bringing substantive criminal justice reform to our country. For too long, in my State we learned that we treated prisons like warehouses, warehousing people and ignoring the fact--or perhaps just not recognizing the significance of the fact--that sooner or later most of them were going to get out of prison. So what we decided to do in Texas in 2007 was to get smart on crime, not just tough on crime. Nobody doubted how tough we were on crime. But what we realized is that some of the money we spent on corrections could be plowed back into educational programs that would help willing inmates actually learn job skills, deal with their drug and alcohol problems, if they had those, and, in short, better prepare for life on the outside so they didn't end up a frequent flyer or in that turnstile, going from prison to the outside and then back again. So we have been working on this issue for some time, based on the success we enjoyed in Texas and in other States. The product is a bill called the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 15 to 5. I know Chairman Goodlatte in the House of Representatives is working on a bipartisan bill in that Chamber as well. So I think this is one of those pivotal moments where folks across the political spectrum see the advantage of working together in favor of bringing real progress that will benefit the American people by making our criminal justice system more effective and our communities safer. By the way, we can save money at the same time. On another matter where we have seen significant progress, this week we will be voting on the conference report that accompanies the Every Child Achieves Act. This is the bill that actually fixes No Child Left Behind. This legislation was passed here in the Senate by wide margins over the summer. Chairman Alexander and the conference committee and Ranking Member Murray were able to achieve an [[Page S8435]] amazing thing in this divided, polarized political environment we are in, with, I believe, a 39-to-1 vote in the conference committee for a bill that combines both the House and the Senate product. This is really landmark education legislation that will help parents and local communities take control of their children's education instead of ceding to the Federal Government. Certainly, this bill is another win for the American people. Where I come from, people like the fact that we essentially have repealed the common core mandate, that we have eliminated the Federal Government as a national school board, and that we have sent the power back where it belongs, which is to parents and teachers and local school districts, and ceded more of that authority from here in Washington, DC, back to them. I could continue with this list of legislative accomplishments by noting that the Chamber has also passed legislation that replaced the flawed Medicare payment system for physicians. This is the notorious doc fix. This is another example where for years and years we passed temporary patches and never solved the underlying problem. But Congress did, and I think that is another thing we can be proud of, along with the first budget passed since 2009, and there is more I could add to the list. But my point is there is a difference in the new 114th Congress, and elections do make a difference. We have worked together on a bipartisan basis where we can to make progress to solve problems for the American people during this first year of the 114th Congress. A lot of this is due to the steady leadership of the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, and all the hard work our colleagues have put in to make this such a productive year. So we are on track to continue with this momentum into the new year, and with just another week or so of work to do before we break for the holidays, I think we can take some pride in these accomplishments but yet know that there is a lot more we have to do, not only for the remainder of this year but into next year as well. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

congress, the 114th congress, and i thought it would be appropriate to take a few minutes to talk about what this chamber has been able to accomplish since we convened in january. i know there is a lot of cynicism and indeed outright fear about the way the federal government has been operating, and unfortunately i think a lot of that is attributable to the fact that this president has shown a complete unwillingness to work with congress in many areas; for example, such as immigration reform. so when people see the president acting unilaterally--thank goodness the courts have stopped it, [[page s8434]] but it causes them to lose confidence in the federal government's ability to address the problems they live with day in and day out and which they have a right to see us do our very best to address. i can't help but think about this time last year and how, with great anticipation and high expectations, the american people decided to give our side of the aisle, the republican side, the opportunity to serve in the majority. our task was a daunting one. the senate had basically been ground to a halt, and i think members on both sides of the aisle came back in january ready to change the way we do things around here. i think some of our friends across the aisle found that the do-nothing strategy didn't work for them either, even though they were in the majority, because a number of senate incumbents--having to face the voters without anything to show--ended up being defeated in last november's election. it didn't work for the american people. so it didn't work for the american people, and it didn't work for those senators. as i said, the american people deserve better. we tried to do better, and i think we have made some progress. we have been getting a few

Mr. President, today, in the United States Senate, I wish to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the founding of Cave City, KY. Next year in 2016, 150 years will have passed since Cave City was first incorporated in 1866. Located in the south central region of the Commonwealth, Cave City is proud to be known worldwide as the home of Mammoth Cave, the world's longest known cave system with more than 400 miles explored underground. It is one of the oldest tourist attractions in the United States. Cave City may only have about 2,500 residents, but more than 2 million visitors flock to Mammoth Cave National Park every year. Cave City is proud to host so many visitors from across the globe and present to them their special brand of Kentucky hospitality and charm. Cave City is not only the gateway to Mammoth Cave, but also home to fine shops and restaurants, privately owned caves open for tours, and many other tourist attractions and places of interest. It is the zip line capital of Kentucky, with three zip line tours close to town. And the Cave City Convention Center is one of the premier meeting and convention venues in the region. The year 2016 will be a busy year for Cave City. Not only is it the 150th anniversary of the town's founding, it is also the 200th anniversary of the earliest known organized tours being given at Mammoth Cave, the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, and the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Mammoth Cave National Park. Therefore, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing that 2016 is the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Cave City and in extending a heartfelt congratulations to the people of Cave City as they celebrate this important milestone. I am proud to be their voice here in the Senate as Cave City represents the very best of what Kentucky has to offer our Nation and the world.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8433-2,CREC-2015-12-07,114,PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8433] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last night the President addressed the Nation. It was one of the few times during his Presidency that he addressed the Nation from the Oval Office, signifying that this was going to be an important address by the Commander in Chief. Unfortunately, what the President communicated was that little, if any, change will be made in the current administration's approach on terrorism following the attack on San Bernardino last week. The President's approach to eradicating this terrorist threat has only resulted in a tactical stalemate that has kept the morale of ISIS high and their recruitment efforts robust, as we have seen. In the wake of the shootings last week, an event the President himself called an act of terrorism, the American people deserve a credible and aggressive strategy to combat this terror threat that clearly poses a danger not just over there but over here. A good start would be for the President to listen to his own military leadership as well as members of the intelligence community. If the reports are true--and they certainly haven't been denied--the President has turned a deaf ear to his own military leadership and leaders of the intelligence community on how to fight and defeat the ISIS threat. Despite the President's rhetoric on his so-called strategy against ISIS, one thing is clear: It is not working. So our country clearly needs to change course, and that should start with a real plan and real candor from the Commander in Chief on how he intends to defend our interests abroad and at home to keep our people safe. While I was eager to hear what the President might say about the bad results from his current strategy, unfortunately, we didn't hear it last night. However, what we did hear was this recent theme from some of our colleagues across the aisle--as we voted on the repeal-ObamaCare set of votes last week--as well as from the President himself during his weekly address, the Democratic leader, and some other Members of the Senate, that what they are basically trying to do is to change the subject. You will recall that one way they tried to do that was by offering an amendment that said people on watch lists would be denied their core constitutional rights under the Bill of Rights, and in this case it happened to be the Second Amendment; that is, you are presumed to be guilty without the necessity of having to go to court and actually prove what you are claiming is true. I was struck by the fact that the New York Times, back in 2014, noted in an editorial entitled ``Terror Watch Lists Run Amok'' that ``A 2007 audit found that more than half of the 71,000 names on the no-fly list were wrongly included.'' This is the New York Times making the case that basically I and others argued for, which is that there cannot be any presumption of guilt just because the government includes your name on a list, particularly when it comes to denying your core constitutional rights. If the Second Amendment isn't strong enough to withstand this so-called presumption, neither is the freedom to worship according to the dictates of your conscience, the First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of association. You get my drift. Rather than address the real problem, which flowed from another speech the President gave a few years ago out of the Oval Office where he announced the precipitous withdrawal of our troops in Iraq that created the vacuum that is now being filled by ISIS and Al Qaeda-- rather than talk about the lessons learned and how a new and different strategy was going to be employed after consultation with our military leadership and members of the intelligence community, the President and his supporters decided to try to change the subject and produce a red herring that has nothing to do with the fight to degrade and defeat ISIS. Of course the threat is not only about people traveling from abroad to our country, it is about Americans here and other people on visas, perhaps from visa waiver countries, traveling from the Middle East to the United States. Perhaps the most dangerous of all is the radicalization of people already in the United States. If the preliminary indications prove to be true, that seems to be the thread that connects so many of these attacks, whether it is in San Bernardino or Garland, TX, a short time back, or MAJ Nidal Hasan at Fort Hood back in 2009. What we need and what the American people deserve from their Commander in Chief is candor and the willingness to show a little humility and say: You know what. The way we have been handling things really isn't working very well. Instead, the President tries to play partisan politics, and he tries to distract the American people by suggesting that our Constitution is too generous when it comes to the right to keep and bear arms.

It was one of the few times during his Presidency that he addressed the Nation from the Oval Office, signifying that this was going to be an important address by the Commander in Chief. Unfortunately, what the President communicated was that little, if any, change will be made in the current administration's approach on terrorism following the attack on San Bernardino last week. The President's approach to eradicating this terrorist threat has only resulted in a tactical stalemate that has kept the morale of ISIS high and their recruitment efforts robust, as we have seen. In the wake of the shootings last week, an event the President himself called an act of terrorism, the American people deserve a credible and aggressive strategy to combat this terror threat that clearly poses a danger not just over there but over here. A good start would be for the President to listen to his own military leadership as well as members of the intelligence community. If the reports are true--and they certainly haven't been denied--the President has turned a deaf ear to his own military leadership and leaders of the intelligence community on how to fight and defeat the ISIS threat. Despite the President's rhetoric on his so-called strategy against ISIS, one thing is clear: It is not working. So our country clearly needs to change course, and that should start with a real plan and real candor from the Commander in Chief on how he intends to defend our interests abroad and at home to keep our people safe. While I was eager to hear what the President might say about the bad results from his current strategy, unfortunately, we didn't hear it last night. However, what we did hear was this recent theme from some of our colleagues across the aisle--as we voted on the repeal-ObamaCare set of votes last week--as well as from the President himself during his weekly address, the Democratic leader, and some other Members of the Senate, that what they are basically trying to do is to change the subject. You will recall that one way they tried to do that was by offering an amendment that said people on watch lists would be denied their core constitutional rights under the Bill of Rights, and in this case it happened to be the Second Amendment; that is, you are presumed to be guilty without the necessity of having to go to court and actually prove what you are claiming is true. I was struck by the fact that the New York Times, back in 2014, noted in an editorial entitled ``Terror Watch Lists Run Amok'' that ``A 2007 audit found that more than half of the 71,000 names on the no-fly list were wrongly included.'' This is the New York Times making the case that basically I and others argued for, which is that there cannot be any presumption of guilt just because the government includes your name on a list, particularly when it comes to denying your core constitutional rights. If the Second Amendment isn't strong enough to withstand this so-called presumption, neither is the freedom to worship according to the dictates of your conscience, the First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of association. You get my drift. Rather than address the real problem, which flowed from another speech the President gave a few years ago out of the Oval Office where he announced the precipitous withdrawal of our troops in Iraq that created the vacuum that is now being filled by ISIS and Al Qaeda-- rather than talk about the lessons learned and how a new and different strategy was going to be employed after consultation with our military leadership and members of the intelligence community, the President and his supporters decided to try to change the subject and produce a red herring that has nothing to do with the fight to degrade and defeat ISIS. Of course the threat is not only about people traveling from abroad to our country, it is about Americans here and other people on visas, perhaps from visa waiver countries, traveling from the Middle East to the United States. Perhaps the most dangerous of all is the radicalization of people already in the United States. If the preliminary indications prove to be true, that seems to be the thread that connects so many of these attacks, whether it is in San Bernardino or Garland, TX, a short time back, or MAJ Nidal Hasan at Fort Hood back in 2009. What we need and what the American people deserve from their Commander in Chief is candor and the willingness to show a little humility and say: You know what. The way we have been handling things really isn't working very well. Instead, the President tries to play partisan politics, and he tries to distract the American people by suggesting that our Constitution is too generous when it comes to the right to keep and bear arms. For the sake of all Americans, I hope the President reconsiders his flawed strategy and produces a more effective one to eradicate ISIS soon because the safety of the American people is clearly at stake. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8433] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS Mr. CORNYN.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8436,CREC-2015-12-07,114,TRIBUTE TO TED BEATTIE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8436] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO TED BEATTIE Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to acknowledge Ted A. Beattie, president and chief executive officer of the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, IL. Earlier this year, Ted announced that he would be retiring from the world's largest indoor aquarium in late 2016. The Shedd Aquarium is home to 32,500 fish habitats and attracts more than 2 million people every year. It is an educational and cultural treasure in Chicago--and the most popular family and tourist attraction in the city. Under Ted Beattie's leadership, the Shedd Aquarium was Chicago's top attended paid cultural attraction for 17 of the last 21 years, welcoming more than 33 million guests. It is an extraordinary accomplishment. After a 35-year affiliation with Shedd, Ted is leaving this beloved institution in good shape. Since joining Shedd in 1994 as the third president and CEO in the aquarium's history, here are just some of his many accomplishments: Ted developed and opened six permanent exhibits, only the second expansion since the aquarium opened its doors in 1930. He created eight special exhibits, the latest being ``Amphibians,'' opening next May, and established the Daniel P. Haerther Center for Conservation and Research, which has grown to include 18 global field research programs. Ted also oversaw the addition of Shedd's onsite animal hospital and lab facilities housed in the A. Watson Armour III Center for Aquatic Animal Health and Welfare. Throughout his time at Shedd, Ted Beattie demonstrated an exceptional ability to engage and inspire the next generation. As president, Ted opened a teen learning lab, a free, collaborative space for teens-- developed by teens--to enhance critical thinking skills while exploring environmental interests and science. Prior to joining Shedd, Ted Beattie served as director for both the Knoxville Zoo and Fort Worth Zoo and held positions at the Chicago Zoological Society's Brookfield Zoo and Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. During his tenure as president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, AZA, he spent 15 years teaching management courses as part of AZA's professional management schools and received AZA's highest award for professional excellence--the R. Marlin Perkins Award for Professional Excellence. Time and time again, Ted found creative ways to get around obstacles and make good things happen for Shedd and other zoos and aquariums across the country. I know this is not the final chapter for Ted Beattie. He will continue to be a passionate advocate for conversation and educational initiatives through the Penny Beattie Leadership Fund, a professional development scholarship program established in honor of Ted's late wife. I congratulate Ted Beattie on his distinguished career and thank him for dedicating a large part of his career to the Shedd Aquarium and the people of Chicago. It has been a pleasure to support his work, and I wish him all the best in the next chapter of his life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8436] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO TED BEATTIE Mr. DURBIN.

Since its inception, this program has offered the opportunity for schools in every State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments in closing the achievement gaps among student groups. Farmersville Elementary School continues to be one of the best performing schools in the State of Indiana. It has been named an Indiana Four Star School multiple times. In 2014, Farmersville Elementary School's ISTEP+ pass rate for English/Language Arts scores increased by more than 5 percent to 99 percent. Mathematics scores increased to approximately 97 percent and above for third through fifth grades. Farmersville Elementary School's effectiveness can be found in its holistic approach and dedication to student achievement. Farmersville staff and students' families work together to teach and instill values that develop strong character including responsibility, goal setting, commitment, and communication. With some of the highest English and mathematics scores in Indiana, Farmersville Elementary School is a stellar example of the benefits that result from dedication, motivation, collaboration, and family partnership in education. I would like to acknowledge Farmersville Elementary School principal Dr. Elizabeth Johns, the entire staff, the student body, and their families.

A bill to improve the administration of certain programs in the insular areas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise with Senator Cantwell of Washington State to introduce the Omnibus Territories Act of 2015, which relates to the U.S. territory of American Samoa, as well as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau--collectively known as the Freely Associated States. Sections 2 and 3 of the legislation are introduced at the request of the administration and section 4 at the request of the governments of the three Freely Associated States. Section 2 would permit the use of resettlement and relocation funds provided to the people of Bikini Atoll to be used within or outside of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. As a result of nuclear weapons testing by the United States in the northern islands and atolls of the Marshall Islands, Congress, through Public Law 97-257 in 1982, provided the people of Bikini Atoll a relocation and resettlement trust fund to be used by the people of Bikini to resettle from their traditional homeland of Bikini Atoll to other islands within the Marshall Islands. Currently, most members of the [[Page S8440]] community live on the islands of Kili and Ejit. Today, however, the people on these islands have limited living space, lack suitable sustainable resources to provide water and food for their population, and they are exposed to tidal flooding on an increasingly frequent basis. Under current Federal law, citizens of the Freely Associated States, including the people of Bikini, are able to enter into, reside, work, and study in the United States as nonimmigrants without visas. This section would allow the people of Bikini to use the resettlement and relocation trust funds for relocation and resettlement outside of the Marshall Islands, whether in the United States or elsewhere, if they so choose. Section 3 seeks to improve air service capabilities in American Samoa. There are currently no U.S. airlines that provide flight service within American Samoa between the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a. The U.S. Department of Transportation has granted a foreign air carrier emergency service capability to provide this service, but that designation must be renewed every thirty days under statutory requirement. This section would amend current statute to allow for a foreign carrier to operate between the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a without the need for an emergency service capability designation. Section 4 would amend the REAL ID Act of 2005, Public Law 109-13, to allow citizens of the Freely Associated States to document their lawful resident status in the United States in conformance with the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and each of these three nations. Section 141 of the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003, Public Law 108-188, and the law that implemented the Compact of Free Association with Palau, Public Law 101-219, permits citizens of the FAS to enter into the United States to lawfully engage in occupations and establish residence as nonimmigrants. However, the REAL ID Act of 2005 did not provide a means for FAS citizens to document their lawful status in the United States. As a consequence, FAS citizens are denied anything more than a temporary ID valid only for one year, resulting in practical difficulties in their ability to maintain employment and engage in other lawful activities where they reside. Giving FAS citizens the ability to document their lawful status and obtain a State-issued driver's license or identification card would facilitate employment and provide more stability and certainty as they engage in lawful activity as legal residents in the United States. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8439-S8440] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Ms. Cantwell) (by request): S. 2360.

Whereas the Jasmine Revolution in January 2011 was the spark that led to the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East and North Africa, ultimately leading to the departure of President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali and the end of his authoritarian rule; Whereas the Quartet is a coalition of 4 civil society organizations: The Tunisian General Labor Union; The Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade, and Handicrafts; The Tunisian Human Rights League;

Whereas Tunisia continues to face serious threats to its security from violent extremist groups operating within Tunisia as well as in neighboring countries; Whereas a terrorist attack on November 24, 2015 on Tunisia's Presidential Guard killed 12 people and represents another effort to undermine democracy and stability in Tunisia;

Mr. President, earlier today Donald Trump called for the United States to ban all Muslims from entering our Nation. This is the single worst idea I have heard from any Presidential candidate, ever. It is inconsistent with our American values. It is inconsistent with our national history. The Nation has looked back on events in our past--for example, the Chinese Exclusion Act or the internment of Japanese American citizens-- and realized it was a huge mistake to make one significant group our enemy. It is inconsistent with the vision of our Constitution, in which all came to the United States seeking to escape persecution and to be able to practice whichever religion they chose. The Founders of the United States did not seek to make our Nation one in which only a single religion could be practiced. They did not seek to establish one religion as a preeminent religion. They instead wanted a safe haven where people could worship as they pleased, which is the heart of our First Amendment. This idea is wrong and wrongheaded. It is wrong in the context that we are not at war with Islam. In fact, we are working in partnership with Islamic nations to take on a terrorist group known as ISIS. It is wrong in that all patriotic Americans of every religion are working together to take on this terrorist group known as ISIS. In addition to being wrong, it is wrongheaded in that making Islam the enemy is playing straight out of ISIS's playbook, which wants to create a war between America and Islam. In that sense, this type of irresponsible statement endangers our national security rather than strengthens it. So let others stand up and embrace our citizens of every religion and recognize the partnership we are in together to take on terrorist forces, that we are working in partnership with a variety of nations that have a whole variety of religions, including Islam, to take on the terrorist force known as ISIS.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgS8441-8,CREC-2015-12-07,114,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR (Executive Session),"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8441-S8443] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read the nomination of Travis Randall McDonough, of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 minutes of debate. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the nomination of Travis McDonough to be a Federal district judge in the Eastern District of Tennessee. He was nominated over a year ago, and his nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote nearly 5 months ago. Despite having the support of his home State Republican Senators, Mr. McDonough's nomination has nevertheless been held up by Republican leadership for no good reason. [[Page S8442]] I will further note that, while Mr. McDonough's vote is long overdue, Republican leadership has skipped over Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo--who is ahead of Mr. McDonough on the Executive Calendar. I recall Republican leadership promising regular order when they took over the majority, so they should explain how skipping over a consensus and eminently qualified nominee with bipartisan support is following regular order. Judge Restrepo was nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the third circuit over a year ago. If confirmed, he would be the first ever Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania on the third circuit. Judge Restrepo has the strong support of the Hispanic National Bar Association and has bipartisan support from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and Senator Casey. Senator Toomey has said not only that he strongly supports Judge Restrepo's confirmation, but that he also recommended him to the President. I cannot explain why Senate Republicans are not allowing Judge Restrepo to be confirmed today. As we approach the end of the year, the Senate Republican majority is coming closer and closer to matching the record for confirming the fewest number of judicial nominees in more than half a century. While most Senators I have served with over the last 40 years would shudder at this fact, the current Republican leadership seems content to accomplish as little as possible when it comes to confirming nominees to our third branch of government. In the 11 months that Republicans have controlled the Senate, only 11 judges will have received a confirmation vote, including today. When Senate Democrats were in the majority during the seventh year of the Bush Presidency, we had already confirmed 36 judges by this point. We should take action right now and hold confirmation votes on the 19 other judicial nominees pending on the floor. Confirming the remaining 19 nominees would fulfill a basic duty of the Senate and would result in a total of 30 judicial nominees confirmed this year. That number is still short of the 36 nominees that Senate Democrats confirmed at the same point of the George W. Bush administration, but it would mark a significant effort by this Senate to reduce vacancies. There is no reason not to do this. All 19 of the nominees were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote, but Republicans still refuse to bring them up for a vote. This obstruction has resulted in needless delays for hard-working Americans who seek justice in our Federal courts. Currently pending on the Senate floor are nominees who would fill judicial emergency vacancies in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Minnesota, New Jersey, Iowa, New York, and California. Senate Republicans have not responded to the urgent needs of those States to the detriment of their own constituents. Throughout his tenure, President Obama has worked with Senators to have the Federal judiciary better reflect the people they serve. Today there are more women and minorities than ever before on the Federal bench. This is an accomplishment that helps ensure the public's confidence in their court system. Unfortunately, that meaningful progress has slowed down under the Senate's Republican control. Today, several nominees of color with outstanding qualifications are being held up for no good reason, including Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo. Senate Republicans are also holding up four exceptional African- American district court nominees and an exceptional Hispanic district court nominee. Two of the African-American nominees--Waverly Crenshaw and Edward Stanton--have been nominated to district court positions in Tennessee. Both have the support of their home State Republican Senators and were unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote; yet they continue to wait for the majority leader to schedule their votes. The three other nominees of color being held up-- Wilhelmina Wright to the District of Minnesota, and John Vazquez and Julien Neals to the District of New Jersey--are all nominated to judicial emergency vacancies. They also all have the support of their home State Senators and were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. In addition to the article III nominees, five nominees to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, who were all nominated more than a year ago, continue to be held up by a single Republican Senator--the junior Senator of Arkansas. The Court of Federal Claims has been referred to as ``the People's Court'' because it allows citizens to seek prompt justice against our government. Of the five nominees, one is a Cuban American who has devoted his entire career to public service at the U.S. Department of Justice; another is an African-American woman who spent over two decades serving as a judge advocate general and as a military judge. All five were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote, but Senator Cotton continues to object to any of them receiving an up-or-down vote. He claims to have concerns with the caseload, but a recent letter from the chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims to the Judiciary Committee has indicated that only one of the nine senior judges is willing to be recalled for full-time duty, and the other three would only agree to be recalled on a limited basis. Moreover, the court's overall caseload has increased 9 percent over the last year. There are no good reasons for Senator Cotton to continue blocking these nominees. They deserve to have their confirmation votes scheduled. Senators can vote for or against them, but they should not be denied a simple up-or-down vote. In a letter dated December 2, 2015, from the American Bar Association to Majority Leader McConnell, the president of the ABA states that ``our courts are unfortunately worse off today than they were at the start of this Congress.'' The letter urges the majority leader to schedule votes on the confirmation of all the article III judicial nominees currently pending on the Executive Calendar. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. The process of confirming judges is about ensuring that the American people have a fully functioning judiciary. Because of Republican obstruction, judicial vacancies have increased by more than 50 percent since they took over the majority, and caseloads are piling up in courts throughout the country. Judicial emergencies have more than doubled since the beginning of this year. I am concerned that the Republican leadership's refusal to confirm judicial nominations this year is undermining the judicial branch and harming the American people who seek justice. I urge Senate Republicans to conclude this year by showing leadership and by scheduling confirmation votes on the remaining judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: American Bar Association, Chicago, IL, December 2, 2015. Hon. Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC. Hon. Harry Reid, Senate Democratic Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC. Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Reid: On behalf of the American Bar Association, I write to urge you to schedule votes on the confirmation of 15 nominees pending on the Senate floor before the Senate recesses for the year. Seven of the pending nominees have the backing of their Republican home-state senators and all 15 have been reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice votes. Most importantly, if confirmed, nine of the pending nominees would fill vacancies that have been declared judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Courts with emergency vacancies have too few judges to handle their workload effectively and deliver timely justice. Regardless of how one views confirmation data comparisons among recent presidents or the fact that the vacancy rate has not reached crisis proportion, our courts are unfortunately worse off today than they were at the start of this Congress. There are 22 more vacancies (with three more in the pipeline this month) and more than twice the number of judicial emergencies today than there were this past January. In some of our courts with judicial emergencies, litigants have to put their businesses or private lives on hold indefinitely while waiting for their day in court. This is unnecessary and unfair. Action on the 15 pending nominees has proceeded slowly to date. Most of them received their nominations over 200 days ago and had to wait over 4 months to be voted out of committee without objection. Even though we appreciate the Senate's full agenda and the short amount of time remaining in the session, we urge you to give [[Page S8443]] every pending nominee a floor vote before you leave for your recess. Absent legitimate concerns over a nominee's qualifications, we believe that this can best be accomplished over the next few weeks by voting on multiple nominees at a time. We know from the daily experience of our more than 400,000 members that vacancies must be filled promptly so that courts have the resources to deliver timely, impartial justice. By putting politics aside, an opportunity is provided for the Senate to use its time in the next two weeks to afford considerable relief to the federal courts. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the American Bar Association. Sincerely, Paulette Brown, President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8441-S8443] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read the nomination of Travis Randall McDonough, of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 minutes of debate. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the nomination of Travis McDonough to be a Federal district judge in the Eastern District of Tennessee. He was nominated over a year ago, and his nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote nearly 5 months ago. Despite having the support of his home State Republican Senators, Mr. McDonough's nomination has nevertheless been held up by Republican leadership for no good reason. [[Page S8442]] I will further note that, while Mr. McDonough's vote is long overdue, Republican leadership has skipped over Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo--who is ahead of Mr. McDonough on the Executive Calendar. I recall Republican leadership promising regular order when they took over the majority, so they should explain how skipping over a consensus and eminently qualified nominee with bipartisan support is following regular order. Judge Restrepo was nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the third circuit over a year ago. If confirmed, he would be the first ever Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania on the third circuit. Judge Restrepo has the strong support of the Hispanic National Bar Association and has bipartisan support from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and Senator Casey. Senator Toomey has said not only that he strongly supports Judge Restrepo's confirmation, but that he also recommended him to the President. I cannot explain why Senate Republicans are not allowing Judge Restrepo to be confirmed today. As we approach the end of the year, the Senate Republican majority is coming closer and closer to matching the record for confirming the fewest number of judicial nominees in more than half a century. While most Senators I have served with over the last 40 years would shudder at this fact, the current Republican leadership seems content to accomplish as little as possible when it comes to confirming nominees to our third branch of government. In the 11 months that Republicans have controlled the Senate, only 11 judges will have received a confirmation vote, including today. When Senate Democrats were in the majority during the seventh year of the Bush Presidency, we had already confirmed 36 judges by this point. We should take action right now and hold confirmation votes on the 19 other judicial nominees pending on the floor. Confirming the remaining 19 nominees would fulfill a basic duty of the Senate and would result in a total of 30 judicial nominees confirmed this year. That number is still short of the 36 nominees that Senate Democrats confirmed at the same point of the George W. Bush administration, but it would mark a significant effort by this Senate to reduce vacancies. There is no reason not to do this. All 19 of the nominees were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote, but Republicans still refuse to bring them up for a vote. This obstruction has resulted in needless delays for hard-working Americans who seek justice in our Federal courts. Currently pending on the Senate floor are nominees who would fill judicial emergency vacancies in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Minnesota, New Jersey, Iowa, New York, and California. Senate Republicans have not responded to the urgent needs of those States to the detriment of their own constituents. Throughout his tenure, President Obama has worked with Senators to have the Federal judiciary better reflect the people they serve. Today there are more women and minorities than ever before on the Federal bench. This is an accomplishment that helps ensure the public's confidence in their court system. Unfortunately, that meaningful progress has slowed down under the Senate's Republican control. Today, several nominees of color with outstanding qualifications are being held up for no good reason, including Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo. Senate Republicans are also holding up four exceptional African- American district court nominees and an exceptional Hispanic district court nominee. Two of the African-American nominees--Waverly Crenshaw and Edward Stanton--have been nominated to district court positions in Tennessee. Both have the support of their home State Republican Senators and were unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote; yet they continue to wait for the majority leader to schedule their votes. The three other nominees of color being held up-- Wilhelmina Wright to the District of Minnesota, and John Vazquez and Julien Neals to the District of New Jersey--are all nominated to judicial emergency vacancies. They also all have the support of their home State Senators and were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. In addition to the article III nominees, five nominees to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, who were all nominated more than a year ago, continue to be held up by a single Republican Senator--the junior Senator of Arkansas. The Court of Federal Claims has been referred to as ``the People's Court'' because it allows citizens to seek prompt justice against our government.

When we empower the men and women in the Intelligence Community with the resources, tools, and capabilities they need, they are able to do their jobs and protect our nation. It is in the finest traditions of Congress that there has been such close cooperation between the House and Senate in undertaking our oversight responsibilities, and also productive collaboration with the Intelligence Community. As always, in the Committee's work of providing guidance to the Intelligence Community, we continue to recommend fiscal responsibility through increased efficiency and the elimination of unnecessary programs. All of this is done with a close eye to protecting every American's Constitutional rights. I do not need to remind anyone that the threats facing the United States are real and dangerous. I applaud the decision to empower our intelligence agencies with potent tools, all the while focused on protecting privacy, to ensure that our interests and our way of life are protected in these uncertain times. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1713] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 ______ speech of HON.

PETER J. VISCLOSKY of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and enthusiasm that I congratulate Ivy Tech Community College and its regional partners who recently celebrated their 11th Annual Northwest Indiana Innovation Induction Ceremony. At the ceremony, which reflects the ``Spirit of Innovation'' in Indiana, eleven individuals and fifteen teams were inducted as members of the 2015-2016 Class of The Society of Innovators of Northwest Indiana. Of these individuals, several members were inducted as Society Fellows for their exceptional efforts in innovation. These individuals are Erin Argyilan, Ph.D., Marilyn Brunk, Tom Clark, Joseph Coar, Joseph Ferrandino, Ph.D., and Donald Galbreath. Also honored were two Chanute Prize recipients, the Green Abilities Team at The Arc Northwest Indiana, and Indiana University Health La Porte Hospital. In addition, the ``Accelerating Greatness'' award was presented to Edgewater Behavioral Health Services and Methodist Hospital, Northlake Campus, for its level III ``in the process'' trauma center. For their truly remarkable contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana and their continuous efforts to cultivate a culture of innovation, these honorees were inducted at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana, on Thursday, October 22, 2015. The Society of Innovators of Northwest Indiana was created by Ivy Tech Northwest with the goal of highlighting and encouraging innovative individuals and groups within the not-for-profit, public, and private sectors, as well as building a ``culture of innovation'' in Northwest Indiana. The importance of innovation in Northwest Indiana, as well as globally, is crucial in today's ever-changing economy. The fellows selected by the Society of Innovators were chosen for their extraordinary innovative leadership and the impact of their accomplishments throughout Northwest Indiana and beyond. Erin Argyilan, Ph.D., is a geologist at Indiana University Northwest. Dr. Argyilan established a new model of a previously unknown geological hazard in sand dunes. Her discovery is called a ``dune decomposition chimney or tunnel,'' and her extensive research helped to explain why six-year-old Nathan Woessner was trapped in a hole on Mount Baldy in 2013. Marilyn Brunk is a teacher at Griffith High School. Marilyn launched a computer science and programming class involving video games, which is the first of its kind in Northwest Indiana and possibly the entire state. Griffith students are excited about this innovative class and enrollment continues to grow each year. Tom Clark is a teacher at Lake Central High School. Tom started the Gold Star Honor Roll Project thirty years ago, and it is among the longest running experimental learning projects in the state and one of the largest in the nation. The project, which is celebrated by students and faculty, involves learning through the gathering of historic memorabilia, validating records, and visiting families of American soldiers killed in combat. Joseph Coar, of Tonn and Blank Construction, spearheaded a carpenter's apprenticeship program that put Indiana in the forefront of innovative curricula for high school students. In addition, his support led to the implementation of the program at A.K. Smith Career Center in La Porte, the first career center in Indiana to offer this program. Joseph [[Page E1714]] Ferrandino, Ph.D., associate professor of criminal justice at Indiana University Northwest, founded the Northwest Indiana Public Safety Data Consortium, which transforms how public safety communicates throughout the region. This truly innovative project connects data and imaging among nearly thirty participating agencies and across four counties. Donald Galbreath has been an innovator in the waste handling industry for the past sixty years. He is best known for inventing ``the most user friendly roll-off hoist in his industry.'' The majority of roll- off hoists used in the waste, scrap, and construction hauling industries were influenced by his inventions. The recipients of the Chanute Prize for Team Innovation should be commended for their contributions. The Green Abilities Team at The Arc Northwest Indiana received this honor for its truly innovative and successful on-site training program in which special needs individuals are taught how to recycle granite remnants into landscaping pavers, tile veneers, and other repurposed products. Indiana University Health La Porte Hospital also received this honor for implementing initiatives that promote a ``fair and just culture'' in which employees are encouraged to report problems. In addition, the hospital launched Rapid Improvement Events in which skilled teams, including physicians, spend a full week focusing on a single opportunity for improvement. These solutions are tested and then implemented within a timeframe goal of thirty days. The Accelerating Greatness Award for Team Innovation included two recipients. Edgewater Behavioral Health Services is the first in the state to develop a program that helps to provide immediate attention to people in psychiatric crisis. The Rapid Access Center allows adults experiencing these types of problems to get help in a short amount of time regardless of their ability to pay for services. Methodist Hospital, Northlake Campus, was also honored with this award for opening the first level III ``in the process'' trauma center in Northwest Indiana, which is the sixteenth in the state. This has been a goal for Methodist Hospitals for more than a decade. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding innovators. The contributions they have made to society here in Northwest Indiana and worldwide are immeasurable and lifelong. For their truly brilliant innovative ideas, projects, and leadership, each recipient is worthy of the highest commendation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1713-E1714] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE SOCIETY OF INNOVATORS OF NORTHWEST INDIANA ______ HON.

PETER J. VISCLOSKY of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and enthusiasm that I congratulate Ivy Tech Community College and its regional partners who recently celebrated their 11th Annual Northwest Indiana Innovation Induction Ceremony. At the ceremony, which reflects the ``Spirit of Innovation'' in Indiana, eleven individuals and fifteen teams were inducted as members of the 2015-2016 Class of The Society of Innovators of Northwest Indiana. Of these individuals, several members were inducted as Society Fellows for their exceptional efforts in innovation. These individuals are Erin Argyilan, Ph.D., Marilyn Brunk, Tom Clark, Joseph Coar, Joseph Ferrandino, Ph.D., and Donald Galbreath. Also honored were two Chanute Prize recipients, the Green Abilities Team at The Arc Northwest Indiana, and Indiana University Health La Porte Hospital. In addition, the ``Accelerating Greatness'' award was presented to Edgewater Behavioral Health Services and Methodist Hospital, Northlake Campus, for its level III ``in the process'' trauma center. For their truly remarkable contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana and their continuous efforts to cultivate a culture of innovation, these honorees were inducted at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana, on Thursday, October 22, 2015. The Society of Innovators of Northwest Indiana was created by Ivy Tech Northwest with the goal of highlighting and encouraging innovative individuals and groups within the not-for-profit, public, and private sectors, as well as building a ``culture of innovation'' in Northwest Indiana. The importance of innovation in Northwest Indiana, as well as globally, is crucial in today's ever-changing economy. The fellows selected by the Society of Innovators were chosen for their extraordinary innovative leadership and the impact of their accomplishments throughout Northwest Indiana and beyond. Erin Argyilan, Ph.D., is a geologist at Indiana University Northwest. Dr. Argyilan established a new model of a previously unknown geological hazard in sand dunes. Her discovery is called a ``dune decomposition chimney or tunnel,'' and her extensive research helped to explain why six-year-old Nathan Woessner was trapped in a hole on Mount Baldy in 2013. Marilyn Brunk is a teacher at Griffith High School. Marilyn launched a computer science and programming class involving video games, which is the first of its kind in Northwest Indiana and possibly the entire state. Griffith students are excited about this innovative class and enrollment continues to grow each year. Tom Clark is a teacher at Lake Central High School. Tom started the Gold Star Honor Roll Project thirty years ago, and it is among the longest running experimental learning projects in the state and one of the largest in the nation. The project, which is celebrated by students and faculty, involves learning through the gathering of historic memorabilia, validating records, and visiting families of American soldiers killed in combat. Joseph Coar, of Tonn and Blank Construction, spearheaded a carpenter's apprenticeship program that put Indiana in the forefront of innovative curricula for high school students. In addition, his support led to the implementation of the program at A.K. Smith Career Center in La Porte, the first career center in Indiana to offer this program. Joseph [[Page E1714]] Ferrandino, Ph.D., associate professor of criminal justice at Indiana University Northwest, founded the Northwest Indiana Public Safety Data Consortium, which transforms how public safety communicates throughout the region. This truly innovative project connects data and imaging among nearly thirty participating agencies and across four counties. Donald Galbreath has been an innovator in the waste handling industry for the past sixty years. He is best known for inventing ``the most user friendly roll-off hoist in his industry.'' The majority of roll- off hoists used in the waste, scrap, and construction hauling industries were influenced by his inventions. The recipients of the Chanute Prize for Team Innovation should be commended for their contributions. The Green Abilities Team at The Arc Northwest Indiana received this honor for its truly innovative and successful on-site training program in which special needs individuals are taught how to recycle granite remnants into landscaping pavers, tile veneers, and other repurposed products. Indiana University Health La Porte Hospital also received this honor for implementing initiatives that promote a ``fair and just culture'' in which employees are encouraged to report problems. In addition, the hospital launched Rapid Improvement Events in which skilled teams, including physicians, spend a full week focusing on a single opportunity for improvement. These solutions are tested and then implemented within a timeframe goal of thirty days. The Accelerating Greatness Award for Team Innovation included two recipients. Edgewater Behavioral Health Services is the first in the state to develop a program that helps to provide immediate attention to people in psychiatric crisis. The Rapid Access Center allows adults experiencing these types of problems to get help in a short amount of time regardless of their ability to pay for services. Methodist Hospital, Northlake Campus, was also honored with this award for opening the first level III ``in the process'' trauma center in Northwest Indiana, which is the sixteenth in the state. This has been a goal for Methodist Hospitals for more than a decade. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding innovators. The contributions they have made to society here in Northwest Indiana and worldwide are immeasurable and lifelong. For their truly brilliant innovative ideas, projects, and leadership, each recipient is worthy of the highest commendation. ____________________",package_114_35.csv,6267,6267,6337,"[congressional

Major Shulman has been selected for promotion to Lieutenant Colonel as he will be accepting a new assignment abroad serving our country in the coming year. Major Shulman's Air Force career began when he was first commissioned as a Distinguished Graduate from Saint Louis University in 2003. He has served with distinction as an F-16 Instructor Pilot, Mission Commander, and a Flight Examiner in the AT-38C. Additionally he has served as an Aide-de-Camp to two Four-Star General officers as well as a fellow at RAND Corporation. Major Shulman has flown the F-16 operationally during Operation NOBLE EAGLE and Operation ENDURING FREEDOM and has 170 combat hours in the F-16 and over 1,500 hours in fighter aircraft. Major Shulman quickly became a valued and respected member of my staff, and was responsible for making invaluable contributions to several major legislative projects, including preserving and protecting military test and training ranges in the Western United States against various types of encroachments and undue restrictions. Major Shulman is truly representative of some of the finest of his generation serving in the United States military, and I believe that his actions and conduct so far in his career have demonstrated a commitment to the Air Force's core values of integrity, service before self, and excellence in all he does.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgE1714,CREC-2015-12-07,114,VETERANS DAY AND AN AMERICAN POW OF JAPAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1714-E1715] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY AND AN AMERICAN POW OF JAPAN ______ HON. DARRELL E. ISSA of california in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the veterans of my district. In particular, I want to call attention to my constituent from Carlsbad, California, Dr. Lester Tenney, 95, a proud member of the 192nd Tank Battalion of the U.S. Army that fought in the defense of Bataan, the Philippines against Imperial Japan in the first battles of World War II. Surrendered by his commanders on April 9, 1942, he survived the infamous 65-mile Bataan Death March, a Hellship to Japan, and nearly three years of brutal, slave labor in a Mitsui coal in southern Japan that is today an UNESCO World Industrial Heritage site. On this 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, it is important to call attention to Dr. Tenney's most important achievement. This has been to forgive his capturers and to forge meaningful friendships with Japanese citizens. In 2008, Dr. Tenney sat down with Japan's ambassador to the United States Ichiro Fujisaki with two simple requests: 1) an official apology to the Allied POWs for the prohibited abuse and slave labor they experienced in the care of Imperial Japan; and 2) a visitation program to Japan to initiate healing and reconciliation. In 2009, the apology was delivered and in 2010 the annual trips began. The result of efforts and experiences by men like Dr. Tenney is that for 70 years Japan has enjoyed a prosperous peace and the United States and Japan have become unshakeable allies. Dr. Tenney reflects upon this and his POW experiences in his occasional articles for The Wall Street Journal. For this year's anniversary of surrender on the USS Missouri, Dr. Tenney wrote what that time meant to him and the other POWs who had been liberated. He rightly points out that the war and the peace is composed of the deeds and sacrifices of many: foot soldier to general; sailor to fisherman; mother to widow. None should be forgotten. With profound respect, I submit Dr. Tenney's essay in which he eloquently reminds us to honor our veterans and implores us to pass on and teach future generations of the legacy of World War II in the Pacific. [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 1, 2015] Japan's War Legacy The postwar generation may now be the majority in Japan, but they too must know the atrocities of war (By Lester Tenney) Imperial Japan became history on Sept. 2, 1945. Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's unconditional surrender on the deck of the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, ending World War II. For me, nearly 600 miles south in a prisoner of war camp outside Nagasaki, unaware of these historic events, I simply remember the pure joy of liberation. What was V-J Day like for POWs? For those of us in Fukuoka No. 17-B POW Camp, the war ended on Aug. 15, when our Mitsui company overseers, without explanation, stopped sending us down into their coal mine. We were returned to camp for an unusual midday meal of limitless rice and recognizable vegetables. We received our first full Red Cross boxes. And the camp guards said ``hello'' in English instead of striking us with their rifle butts for not bowing. After lunch, the camp commander, flanked by trucks mounted with machine guns, gathered us on the camp's parade ground. He curtly announced, ``America and Japan now friends. War is over.'' There is no accurate way to describe how it feels to be a slave one moment--starved and abused, forced to work long hours in a treacherous mine, beaten daily for not working fast enough or not bowing low enough--and a free man the next. After more than two years underground in the dark, narrow seams of a coal mine, it was glorious to be in the sun. American planes soon appeared overhead and with them came parachutes carrying 55-gallon drums of food, clothing, medicines and magazines. One parachute failed to open, its cargo of fruit salad spilling out onto the camp yard. We happily and immediately dined on the scattered remains. Baron Mitsui, a 1915 Dartmouth graduate who owned our coal mine and many others, hosted a series of dinners for senior Allied commanding officers of our POW camp. The baron had often visited his captive village and was aware of the grim conditions. Over the meals, he reportedly asked the officers for their tolerance and thanked them for their efforts. Photos from the dinner series show a wary indulgence in the eyes of the American, Australian, British and Dutch guests. Fast forward to last month, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe used the same word--tolerance--in his statement on the 70th anniversary of the war's end. ``How much emotional struggle must have existed and what great efforts must have been necessary . . . for the former POWs who experienced unbearable sufferings caused by the Japanese military in order for them to be so tolerant nevertheless?'' Mr. Abe marveled. While I welcome any step, however modest, the Japanese make in addressing war crimes committed against POWs, this word stops me short. It makes a war crime a matter of inconvenience. I can tolerate someone cutting me off in traffic. But being a POW was not a matter of tolerance. It was a matter of life or death--mostly death. The denial of water and food on the Bataan Death March didn't simply inconvenience us; it killed thousands of soldiers. My fellow prisoners and I didn't tolerate nor have we forgotten the beatings and torture, the starvation and broken bones, or the filth and stench of dying men. What tolerance did I have watching my buddy tortured so viciously that he had to have both legs amputated? And what of today? Our wait for Japan's apology, offered officially in February 2009, wasn't tolerance. It was patience. Patience for justice. Still, Mr. Abe's awkward statement on Aug. 15 suggests that our patience may not be in vain. His mention of POWs is the only reference in the statement that clearly matches a noun of wrongdoing to a verb of responsibility. He correctly points out that ``unbearable suffering'' was ``caused'' by Imperial Japan's military. Acknowledging the perpetrator of a crime and the crime itself is the first step toward reconciliation. For me, the war is hard to forget. But as Mr. Abe points out, the postwar generations are now the majority in Japan. Japanese today aren't responsible for what happened more than 70 years ago. But they also cannot forget or distort the past. Japan owes me, the descendants of its victims and its own citizens the truth. As Mr. Abe said, ``We Japanese, across generations, must squarely face the history of the past. We have the responsibility to inherit the past, in all humbleness, and pass it on to the future.'' Imperial Japan tormented, enslaved and defiled many people. This is a grave legacy to pass on and to teach future generations. But it is vital to keep memories like mine alive. It's one thing to remember great deeds done by great men, like Gen. MacArthur in Tokyo Bay. But World War II's history is composed of the suffering of many individuals in different circumstances. This, too, should not be forgotten, or else the lessons of the war will be incomplete.

As Mr. Abe said, ``We Japanese, across generations, must squarely face the history of the past. We have the responsibility to inherit the past, in all humbleness, and pass it on to the future.'' Imperial Japan tormented, enslaved and defiled many people. This is a grave legacy to pass on and to teach future generations. But it is vital to keep memories like mine alive. It's one thing to remember great deeds done by great men, like Gen. MacArthur in Tokyo Bay. But World War II's history is composed of the suffering of many individuals in different circumstances. This, too, should not be forgotten, or else the lessons of the war will be incomplete.

DARRELL E. ISSA of california in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the veterans of my district. In particular, I want to call attention to my constituent from Carlsbad, California, Dr. Lester Tenney, 95, a proud member of the 192nd Tank Battalion of the U.S. Army that fought in the defense of Bataan, the Philippines against Imperial Japan in the first battles of World War II. Surrendered by his commanders on April 9, 1942, he survived the infamous 65-mile Bataan Death March, a Hellship to Japan, and nearly three years of brutal, slave labor in a Mitsui coal in southern Japan that is today an UNESCO World Industrial Heritage site. On this 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, it is important to call attention to Dr. Tenney's most important achievement. This has been to forgive his capturers and to forge meaningful friendships with Japanese citizens. In 2008, Dr. Tenney sat down with Japan's ambassador to the United States Ichiro Fujisaki with two simple requests: 1) an official apology to the Allied POWs for the prohibited abuse and slave labor they experienced in the care of Imperial Japan; and 2) a visitation program to Japan to initiate healing and reconciliation. In 2009, the apology was delivered and in 2010 the annual trips began. The result of efforts and experiences by men like Dr. Tenney is that for 70 years Japan has enjoyed a prosperous peace and the United States and Japan have become unshakeable allies. Dr. Tenney reflects upon this and his POW experiences in his occasional articles for The Wall Street Journal. For this year's anniversary of surrender on the USS Missouri, Dr. Tenney wrote what that time meant to him and the other POWs who had been liberated. He rightly points out that the war and the peace is composed of the deeds and sacrifices of many: foot soldier to general; sailor to fisherman; mother to widow. None should be forgotten. With profound respect, I submit Dr. Tenney's essay in which he eloquently reminds us to honor our veterans and implores us to pass on and teach future generations of the legacy of World War II in the Pacific. [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 1, 2015] Japan's War Legacy The postwar generation may now be the majority in Japan, but they too must know the atrocities of war (By Lester Tenney) Imperial Japan became history on Sept. 2, 1945. Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's unconditional surrender on the deck of the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, ending World War II. For me, nearly 600 miles south in a prisoner of war camp outside Nagasaki, unaware of these historic events, I simply remember the pure joy of liberation. What was V-J Day like for POWs? For those of us in Fukuoka No. 17-B POW Camp, the war ended on Aug. 15, when our Mitsui company overseers, without explanation, stopped sending us down into their coal mine. We were returned to camp for an unusual midday meal of limitless rice and recognizable vegetables. We received our first full Red Cross boxes. And the camp guards said ``hello'' in English instead of striking us with their rifle butts for not bowing. After lunch, the camp commander, flanked by trucks mounted with machine guns, gathered us on the camp's parade ground. He curtly announced, ``America and Japan now friends. War is over.'' There is no accurate way to describe how it feels to be a slave one moment--starved and abused, forced to work long hours in a treacherous mine, beaten daily for not working fast enough or not bowing low enough--and a free man the next. After more than two years underground in the dark, narrow seams of a coal mine, it was glorious to be in the sun. American planes soon appeared overhead and with them came parachutes carrying 55-gallon drums of food, clothing, medicines and magazines. One parachute failed to open, its cargo of fruit salad spilling out onto the camp yard. We happily and immediately dined on the scattered remains. Baron Mitsui, a 1915 Dartmouth graduate who owned our coal mine and many others, hosted a series of dinners for senior Allied commanding officers of our POW camp. The baron had often visited his captive village and was aware of the grim conditions. Over the meals, he reportedly asked the officers for their tolerance and thanked them for their efforts. Photos from the dinner series show a wary indulgence in the eyes of the American, Australian, British and Dutch guests. Fast forward to last month, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe used the same word--tolerance--in his statement on the 70th anniversary of the war's end. ``How much emotional struggle must have existed and what great efforts must have been necessary . . . for the former POWs who experienced unbearable sufferings caused by the Japanese military in order for them to be so tolerant nevertheless?'' Mr. Abe marveled. While I welcome any step, however modest, the Japanese make in addressing war crimes committed against POWs, this word stops me short. It makes a war crime a matter of inconvenience. I can tolerate someone cutting me off in traffic. But being a POW was not a matter of tolerance. It was a matter of life or death--mostly death. The denial of water and food on the Bataan Death March didn't simply inconvenience us; it killed thousands of soldiers. My fellow prisoners and I didn't tolerate nor have we forgotten the beatings and torture, the starvation and broken bones, or the filth and stench of dying men. What tolerance did I have watching my buddy tortured so viciously that he had to have both legs amputated? And what of today? Our wait for Japan's apology, offered officially in February 2009, wasn't tolerance. It was patience. Patience for justice. Still, Mr. Abe's awkward statement on Aug. 15 suggests that our patience may not be in vain. His mention of POWs is the only reference in the statement that clearly matches a noun of wrongdoing to a verb of responsibility. He correctly points out that ``unbearable suffering'' was ``caused'' by Imperial Japan's military. Acknowledging the perpetrator of a crime and the crime itself is the first step toward reconciliation. For me, the war is hard to forget. But as Mr. Abe points out, the postwar generations are now the majority in Japan. Japanese today aren't responsible for what happened more than 70 years ago. But they also cannot forget or distort the past. Japan owes me, the descendants of its victims and its own citizens the truth. As Mr. Abe said, ``We Japanese, across generations, must squarely face the history of the past. We have the responsibility to inherit the past, in all humbleness, and pass it on to the future.''

champion, and from where does it all so come and how is one so born into this among and where does such a splendid gift originate from and how may we pass on these gifts of love, to our sons for its only through our love and time, and life lessons find, what we have won for our days on this earth, are the shortest of all ones so cherish each moment with your sons for its all about what we leave behind, when all is said and done so who will we touch before our last suns to raise a son and instill in him all his of hopes and dreams, and values to come to bestow upon him all your gifts of love, to help him rise above one of our lord's most precious gifts, is to raise a child of love no greater blessing on the wings of a dove because a child is the brightest of all lights. passing onto him all our wisdom and love. watching him grow up into a fine man, is the culmination of all our dreams begun there was once a little boy sitting on his father's knee, as his dad spoke to him about his future dreams, and what he could be. ``listen my son, you are the one, believe'' ``and little man, you will go favre and football is in your blood and she'll give you all you need!'' and from that first day as was completed, such a warm bond in hearts to succeed it a catch with dad, a fine father and son, as such a love story grew on fields of green like father like son into this winning team as a father and a coach passed onto him his creed showing him what he would need and what it was to be a man, hitting pay dirt in the game of life . . . td a pat on the back, extending a warm hand, and respect to demand, to lead his heart towards his future dreams and throughout the years, those bumps and bruises here nights at home with broken bones, and contusions as a love story grew so dear. pop warner, high school ball, and then a college comes to call, and soon the big leagues brett's name would fear to be a pro, at the top, to be the best, as brett's leadership they could not contest as the cream of the crop, is an almost impossible quest, to be in the hall of fame one day as one of the very best in football, the very heart of any team is but the quarterback the point from which, all leadership on fields of green attacks where the toughest of the tough react with only micro seconds to counteract, on coming mammoths of size and speed as all around you 300lb men come crashing in, trying to make you bleed and throughout the years, many great names have here played on fields of green like johnny its u, the young man too, the montana man, in the namath of football whose legend grew, that shaw of football terry too, and peyton's place, marino, captain comeback stauback, a cool brees, brady, rocket rogers a list of greats he, and bart a star of the who's who and now its brave brett, that gunslinger with the quad threat history pursued and when we close the door on number ``4'' in the hall of fame him we will view a ``4'' threat man who can beat you with his feet, his arm, his head, and his heart too. because on fields of green, brett is one of greatest warriors seen smashing all known records as he deemed a gunslinger who could hit any target, dislocating receivers fingers on his team and it did not happen by luck or by circumstance, but because of a father's love which gave him the chance who helped him shape his future dreams, as reflections of him in brett are seen because of this great love which convened. which helped him weather the storms of life, when days turned mean. as he grew up strong and tall, to compete on those fields of green for football is such a splendid game, where her life lessons with us remain where a father and son's reflections, into future generation can be seen the year was 2003, as across our country a great love story was about to convene as the power of a father and son's love, our nation was about to glean as brett went deep on the tv screen just like the gipper of old, a new love story was about to unfold as a nation for his son so grieved to win one for dad on fields of green with tears in eyes, brett showed us all why, in life what the most so really means as we saw what his dad had given him, so deep down inside that which gleams solid gold, molding one of the greatest of all time so. bringing tears to eyes in life, no greater victory can be achieved. then the love of a parent and child believe from end to end, no greater drive could be conceived sadly though, some children will never know such a friend so very deep to arm a child, with their love all the while to compete. to realize his dreams to seek up in heaven this day brett your dad is working out a long term contract with vince and our lord for when you come up to play where, you can walk with your best friend and talk football and go fishing once again. for heaven my friends, is the real super bowl for all us to contend. and there can be no greater gift, then all of this in a child's heart to help him rise above and that's why in the game of life, brett always went deep armed with his father's love. ____________________",5810

EARL BLUMENAUER of oregon in the house of representatives Thursday, December 3, 2015 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the passage of H.R. 22, Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, is a significant accomplishment. It ends the embarrassing string of 37 short-term extensions. It provides five years of certainty with modest, but important, increased spending levels. There are provisions that deal with safety, innovation, and integrating passenger rail into overall surface transportation, among many other notable items. I am pleased that a number of provisions that I have authored and championed have found their way into the final version of this legislation. One of the unheralded provisions potentially has the most significant, far-reaching consequences--the expansion of work on an alternative user-fee to replace the gas tax. This reflects legislation I have introduced that builds upon the Oregon pilot project on road user charges. There is also a specific title dealing with innovation. The next five years will see unparalleled changes in transportation practices and technology that can have a transformational effect on our way of life, and this bill embraces this. Unfortunately, Congress continues to refuse to address a Highway Trust Fund that is inadequate and losing purchasing power by the month. Refusing to increase the gas tax for 22 years or to have any other source of revenue has complicated passage of a long-term bill. Instead, the collection of budget gimmicks paying for the legislation are, in many cases, questionable. For example, using private bill collectors to hound low-income taxpayers who run into financial difficulty is a money loser, as well as ineffective and unpopular. This is one of many ways the bill is paid for, basically to disguise the use of the Treasury's general fund instead of the traditional user fee model. I am hopeful that we can use the next five years to build upon the positive framework of the legislation and for Congress to accept the overwhelming consensus of the people who build, maintain, and use our surface transportation system. They want to increase user fees to adequately fund transportation, and so should we as well. I will vote for this bill because the positive policy features are compelling and because it gives us an opportunity to use this five-year period of stability to get it right. I will spare no effort to do so, and I hope I'm joined by my colleagues so that the next reauthorization truly enables us to rebuild and renew America, put millions of Americans to work at family wage jobs, and strengthen communities from coast to coast. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1716] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 22, SURFACE TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION AND REFORM ACT OF 2015 ______ speech of HON.

LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD of california in the house of representatives Thursday, December 3, 2015 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Conference Report on H.R. 22, The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. This agreement is long overdue, as communities across the country have been clamoring for a long-term funding bill that provides certainty to infrastructure projects across the country, rather than trying to pay for these projects with flat-line funding and short-term extensions. This legislative measure provides $281 billion in guaranteed funding for highway, transit, and transportation safety programs for five years. This funding will keep these programs solvent for the entire five-year period. In addition, the agreement provides $24 billion from the General Fund, including $11.5 billion to be used for transit New Starts projects and $10.4 billion for Amtrak and intercity passenger rail grants. Thanks to this measure, California will receive $19.4 billion in highway funding and $6.8 billion in transit funding over the five-year period. I am also proud to support the four-year reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank included in this conference report. This bank supports millions of dollars in exports by 40th District businesses, and helps level the playing field for American businesses to better compete in today's ever-growing, interconnected economy. I applaud the bipartisan effort which was so critical to including the bank's reauthorization in this agreement, and I look forward to witnessing the bank's further success and its continued support for American businesses. However, this package is not perfect. The reality is our country needs an even more robust investment in infrastructure than what is provided through this measure. I also have concerns about the funding provisions in this bill. For example, it indexes Customs User Fees to inflation and uses them to offset the cost of the bill at a time when these fees are needed for expenses related to staffing at our borders. Nevertheless, I hope that the funding stability this agreement provides will allow us to look ahead to the long-term solvency of the highway and transit programs. Congress should utilize the five-year authorization period to develop a reliable and reasonable funding mechanism to pay for future reauthorizations that eliminates the need for multiple short-term extensions. I believe this bipartisan legislation is a step in the right direction, and I urge all members to support this agreement.

That said, once again, Congress missed an opportunity. We had the chance to responsibly and sustainably fund our transportation system with real revenue sources. Instead, we cobbled together one-time funding sources that will put us right back where we are today when the bill expires: in the midst of a funding shortfall and a crisis. I had long advocated for funding our transportation bill by collecting taxes on corporate profits trapped overseas. This would be a step towards fixing our broken tax system and would discourage American companies from moving overseas. Doing so also would have provided a significant source of funding for the bill, and created the momentum to reform our international tax code. Instead, our tax code is still broken, and we no longer have the leverage of a must-pass transportation bill to fix it. Passage of this bill means we're better off than we were before. States and local transportation agencies have the certainty they need to map out the infrastructure improvement projects our nation sorely needs. And our public transit system will be strengthened.

Instead, our tax code is still broken, and we no longer have the leverage of a must-pass transportation bill to fix it. Passage of this bill means we're better off than we were before. States and local transportation agencies have the certainty they need to map out the infrastructure improvement projects our nation sorely needs. And our public transit system will be strengthened. I remain committed to finding a more responsible way to fund these programs and to fixing our tax system. ____________________",package_114_35.csv,2294,2294,2364,"[congressional record volume 161, number 176 (monday, december 7, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1716] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] conference report on h.r. 22, surface transportation reauthorization and reform act of 2015 ______ speech of hon. john c. carney, jr. of delaware in the house of representatives thursday, december 3, 2015 mr. carney. mr. speaker, i submit this statement regarding house passage of fixing america's surface transportation (fast) act. with many reservations and a sense of frustration, i will vote for this bill. i believe in the bill's core goals--investing in our infrastructure and providing stability to our transportation system. the legislation raises funding levels to meet the needs of our crumbling roads and bridges and avoids the short-term patches that have plagued the bill for years. i'm also glad it's the result of a bipartisan effort, and supports infrastructure projects and programs like the high density transit program and the export-import bank. that said, once again, congress missed an opportunity. we had the chance to responsibly and sustainably fund our transportation system with real revenue sources. instead, we cobbled together one-time funding sources that will put us right back where we are today when the bill expires: in the midst of a funding shortfall and a crisis. i had long advocated for funding our transportation bill by collecting taxes on corporate profits trapped overseas. this would be a step towards fixing our broken tax system and would discourage american companies from moving overseas. doing so also would have provided a significant source of funding for the bill, and created the momentum to reform our international tax code. instead, our tax code is still broken, and we no longer have the leverage of a must-pass transportation bill to fix it. passage of this bill means we're better off than we were before. states and local transportation agencies have the certainty they need to map out the infrastructure improvement projects our nation sorely needs. and our public transit system will be strengthened. i remain committed to finding a more responsible way to fund these programs and to fixing our tax system. ____________________",2294

BILL PASCRELL, JR. of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to your attention the achievements of an outstanding faith community, the Cedar Cliff United Methodist Church (UMC), which celebrated their ministry's 125th Anniversary of successful service to the community of Haledon on Sunday, December 6, 2015. Since December 7, 1890, when it first opened its doors, the church has stood in its current location, serving as a house of worship in the town of Haledon, on 18 Zabriskie Street. The church has its own unique piece of history, through their bell which was donated by U.S. Vice President Barret A. Hobart. Many members of the church have also served in the military since World War I. Cedar Cliff UMC is located in a neighborhood that is ethnically diverse and constantly changing. It has one traditional Sunday morning worship service. Current ministries within the church include the prayer shawl ministry, Bible study, Monday night yoga classes, a food pantry and joint fellowship events with a partner church that shares its facilities. The church has also been home to many Boys & Girls Scout troops throughout the years. The church has been a place where many babies have been baptized, a place where couples get married, and also a place where family members have laid their loved ones to rest in their sanctuary. But most importantly, many lives have been changed by the people that have called Cedar Cliff UMC home since 1890. The ministry has been a major part of the Haledon community and continues to serve all. The Church members and organizers have worked passionately to build many bridges between different groups within the faith community. The Cedar Cliff UMC has had many leaders throughout its years. Today, it is led by Reverend Pamela Grant James, who has inspired many to follow the path of faith and kindness. Reverend James has helped shape our society and is deserving of every bit of recognition for her selfless actions. It gives me pride to recognize the excellence of the Cedar Cliff UMC and I thank them for servicing the residents of Haledon. I am grateful to represent the Church and its congregation within the 9th Congressional District of New Jersey. The job of a United States Congressman involves much that is rewarding, yet nothing compares to recognizing and commemorating the achievements of faith communities such as the Cedar Cliff UMC. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, and the Cedar Cliff UMC in celebrating their 125th Anniversary and recognizing their leadership, dedication and loyalty to serving the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1716] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CEDAR CLIFF UNITED METHODIST CHURCH ______ HON.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgE1717,CREC-2015-12-07,114,CONGRATULATING THE ROMEO BULLDOGS FOOTBALL TEAM ON WINNING THE DIVISION 1 MICHIGAN STATE CHAMPIONSHIP,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1717] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING THE ROMEO BULLDOGS FOOTBALL TEAM ON WINNING THE DIVISION 1 MICHIGAN STATE CHAMPIONSHIP ______ HON. CANDICE S. MILLER of michigan in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to recognize a special achievement recently accomplished by the Romeo Bulldogs High School Football Team. Romeo capped off a remarkable and extremely memorable 2015 season by taking home to Macomb County the school's first ever Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) Division 1 State Championship. After a hard fought, one loss regular season the Bulldogs charged into the playoffs facing great adversity, challenging weather conditions and tough competition before upsetting the number four ranked Detroit Cass Tech Technicians at Ford Field. In 2002, Romeo was in need of a football coach. Assistant coaches Curt Rienas and Jason Couch both applied for the job and were named co- coaches. Coaches Rienas and Couch had Romeo Bulldogs football in their veins, first meeting each other as teammates on the field and the friendship grew. The two had made it to the semifinals together, but never further until this team. Coach Curt Rienas and Coach Jason Couch became the first co-coaches in playoff history to win a state championship. The Bulldogs played strong hard-nosed football focusing on the basic fundamentals and taking each play one at a time. This meant each player executing his designated assignment and beating the man in front of him. This also included playing sound defense with solid tackling and implementing an offensive scheme that would make an NFL playbook look elementary. The Bulldogs kept constant pressure on their opponents by blocking a punt, recovering an onside kick and making big plays on offense. Before making it to the State Championship game, the Romeo Bulldogs played what will probably be remembered as the second most memorable game of the season. The Romeo Bulldogs faced off against Grand Ledge in Brighton, Michigan for a game of the ages. Over a half foot of snow fell during the game and the Bulldogs ended Grand Ledge's historic undefeated season with a 48-21 victory. With victories against current state champion Clarkston, Lapeer, Detroit Catholic Central and finally Grand Ledge, the Bulldogs were ready for their final challenge against the Detroit Cass Tech Technicians. The team brushed aside any potential distractions and purely focused on winning the game. Despite the best efforts of Detroit Cass Tech, the Romeo Bulldogs would not be denied because this was their day alone. After an exciting first quarter and a 13-7 Bulldogs lead, the game remained close at the half with the Bulldogs holding on to a 19-14 lead. Romeo started the second half off by recovering the opening onside kick. The Bulldogs would use the favorable field position to drive 48 yards to the end zone putting the Bulldogs ahead 26-14. On Cass Tech's next possession, the Technicians went three-and-out which forced a punting situation. Romeo blocked the punt, again giving the Bulldogs excellent field position. The following play was a 20-yard run for a touchdown to put the Bulldogs in the lead by a score of 33-14. Nearing the end of the third quarter, Cass Tech would put six points on the board and follow it up with a touchdown halfway through the fourth quarter cutting the Bulldogs lead to 33-27. The Romeo Bulldogs would continue to pressure and push the play, resulting in a touchdown with 1:29 left in the game to seal the victory and make school history. The Bulldogs throughout the year exhibited the intangible ingredients which make up a winning football team: heart, discipline and a positive attitude. As legendary Hall of Fame Green Bay Packers Coach Vince Lombardi once said, ``A man can be as great as he wants to be. If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the determination, the dedication, the competitive drive and if you are willing to sacrifice the little things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done.'' I applaud these young men for remaining both mentally and physically ready to compete. In addition, I want to commend the Bulldogs for staying energized and focused each time they stepped on to the gridiron. I understand this can be an extremely difficult task considering the numerous pressures and distractions high school student-athletes can encounter. Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize the hard work and sportsmanship displayed by all the members of this football team. I also want to congratulate administrators, teachers, cheerleaders, parents, students and fans alike for their assistance and for making this an unforgettable season. The Bulldogs proved they had the talent, fortitude and resilience to rise to the challenge and accomplish their ultimate goal--a State Championship. Teamwork, perseverance and friendship all contributed to this title as well. I know the community takes great pride in what these young men were able to achieve. In closing Mr. Speaker, I share that same pride. I want to offer my personal congratulations and best wishes. All the accolades, awards and trophies are rightfully deserved. Way to go Bulldogs. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1717] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING THE ROMEO BULLDOGS FOOTBALL TEAM ON WINNING THE DIVISION 1 MICHIGAN STATE CHAMPIONSHIP ______ HON.

CRESSY, EdD. ______ HON. TODD C. YOUNG of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend Dr. Peter H. Cressy, Ed.D., the President and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States on his remarkable career and wish him well as he is set to retire from this position in January. Dr. Cressy has led an impressive career that includes 28 years of service to our nation in the United States Navy which concluded with his retirement as a Rear Admiral. His leadership roles continued with some of the nation's most prestigious academic institutions, and in government service roles where he held senior positions at the State Department, on Capitol Hill, and the Pentagon. Dr. Cressy's most recent leadership role at the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States has led to a stronger, more responsible, and transparent industry. Under his leadership the distilled spirits industry has grown both domestically and internationally all while placing an emphasis on and commitment to responsible and transparent practices. This commitment is evident in the industry's advertising and marketing Code of Responsible Practices which has been referenced as a model of responsible industry self-regulation as well as the Council's efforts to work with retailers and wholesalers, universities, and [[Page E1717]] health professionals to support programs to prevent alcohol abuse. Dr. Cressy's leadership has demonstrated the value of transparent and responsible ethics and has resulted in tangible successes across all facets of the industry. Dr. Cressy's passion for responsible business practices and the expansion of business are tremendous but he also takes great pride in preserving the storied history and heritage of the U.S. distilled spirits industry. One of his most notable successes with respect to historical preservation was his leadership in undertaking the $1.6 million dollar reconstruction of George Washington's Distillery at Historic Mount Vernon. Since the project's completion the Council and the industry have maintained an ongoing relationship with the estate which now carries out a historic preservation and educational mission. In fact it is where they hold their annual industry Spirit of Mount Vernon dinner gala which has raised over $4 million to advance the educational mission at Mount Vernon. Dr. Cressy's leadership will be sorely missed at the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States and by those who have come to know him through his work, but I know the entire distilled spirits industry and many others join me in recognizing his career full of achievements and wishing him the best as he moves into a new chapter of his life. Again congratulations to Dr. Cressy on his retirement and a job well done. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1716-E1717] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING PETER H.

MIKE THOMPSON of california in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor Belinda Espinosa, the City Manager of Pinole, California. After more than thirty years, Ms. Espinosa is retiring from public service. Ms. Espinosa's city management career has spanned over four cities and two states. Beginning in the cities of San Antonio and Grand Prairie, Texas, Ms. Espinosa worked on budget and financial issues, managed infrastructure projects, and oversaw hundreds of millions of dollars in bond funds. In 1994, Ms. Espinosa moved to California to become City Manager for the City of Soledad, where she supervised critical water and wastewater projects, the construction of new affordable housing, and the completion of the Soledad Community Library. In 2000, Ms. Espinosa moved to the City of Pinole, California. Initially hired as the Assistant City Manager, she was promoted four years later to City Manager and Chief Executive Officer, overseeing the police and fire departments, public works planning, wastewater services, recreation and redevelopment. Ms. Espinosa spearheaded several efforts to revitalize Pinole, including the construction of the Pinole Shores Industrial Business Park, the Pinole Valley Shopping Center and the Kaiser Permanente Medical Office. Under her leadership, Pinole voters approved two half-cent sales tax measures, which generate $3.6 million for public safety and other supplemental services. Ms. Espinosa also successfully negotiated Pinole's first Project Labor Agreement, for the $48 million Pinole-Hercules Wastewater Treatment Plant project. Ms. Espinosa has received numerous accolades for her years of public service, including the 1996 Monterey County Public Administrator Award, the 2007 Contra Costa College Woman of the Year Award, and the 2009 Distinguished Project Award. Ms. Espinosa has also served as President of the Pinole Rotary Club and the International Hispanic Network, and was the first female President of the Grand Prairie Kiwanis Club. Ms. Espinosa has long worked under a philosophy of approaching problems with collaboration, honesty and understanding. She is well-known for being forthright in her dealings, and has always maintained the highest integrity in serving her constituencies. Mr. Speaker, Belinda Espinosa has had a long and remarkable career in public service. It is fitting and proper that we honor her here today, and wish her the best in retirement.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgE1718,CREC-2015-12-07,114,IN RECOGNITION OF CHERYL JENNINGS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1718] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF CHERYL JENNINGS ______ HON. JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor one of the most recognizable, watched and listened-to women in the Bay Area: Cheryl Jennings has been in the 5 o'clock news anchor chair at ABC7 KGO-TV for 27 years and worked at the station for 36 years. It is safe to say that she is one of the most trusted and admired reporters/anchors in our area and I am one of her staunchest fans. Cheryl is ostensibly slowing down, but not quite. She will continue to host her weekend show Beyond the Headlines and report more long-format stories like the series she recently did in Afghanistan. Over the decades Cheryl has reported on just about every topic, but all of her stories have one thing in common: she always finds an angle to help people. Cheryl is one of the most giving, empathetic and genuine people I know. The word ``no'' doesn't exist in her vocabulary. I have had the distinct honor to work with Cheryl on countless occasions. For years, she has been the masterful emcee at Professional Businesswomen of California and other programs. She has been the keynote speaker at my Congressional events for middleschoolers and seniors. As a journalist, she is warm and inviting, but always professional and insistent on the truth. I took on the issue of rape and sexual assault in the military about five years ago. Many stories have been written and produced about this horrendous epidemic, but it was Cheryl Jennings who produced, wrote and reported the most comprehensive and powerful piece on the subject that I have seen. Cheryl learned the value of hard work, perseverance and public service early on. She was one of seven children born to a father who served in the U.S. Army and a mother who raised her and her siblings. As the oldest, Cheryl had lots of opportunity to change diapers, feed and take care of babies. The military sent Cheryl's family all over the world. By the time she started high school, she had changed schools more than a dozen times. She says that part was tough, but prepared her well for life in TV. Her original plans to become a teacher changed when she started college at City College of San Francisco. Her advisor told her to look for another career path because there were too many teachers. Cheryl interviewed two very rare women for a story in the college newspaper. They both worked in television, on air--almost unheard of in that era. The rest is history. Reporting was not an easy path. While she was earning her Bachelor's degree from San Francisco State University, she was rejected for volunteer-entry-level positions at TV stations 19 out of 20 times. Finally, a woman at the local NBC station hired her to work 50 hours a week while she continued to go to school. Her pay? Nothing. But her hard work and perseverance eventually paid off. The NBC station hired her as a paid receptionist, she worked her way into the newsroom, and in 1979, KGO TV hired her as a night reporter. The entire Bay Area became her classroom and she has taught her lessons exceptionally well. Cheryl has travelled the world to tell stories--Mexico, Kosovo, Afghanistan, South Africa, Korea, Israel and the West Bank. Here at home, one of the most memorable stories she covered was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. She was the first local reporter on the air thanks to the station's quick power generator. KGO's coverage earned the team two of the most prestigious broadcast awards, a George Foster Peabody Award and the Radio Television News Directors Association Edward R. Murrow Award. Cheryl says this was the moment she understood just how vital television is in providing public service. Doing good is what drives Cheryl. In 2003, she co-founded the Roots for Peace Children's Penny Campaign, a non-profit that removes landmines in war-torn countries and builds and repairs schools. She works with the Taylor Family Foundation and the Okizu Foundation to help children with life-threatening illnesses. She lends her voice and passion to many non-profit events that raise awareness and funds. All of this amazing work has earned Cheryl many awards, including six Gracie Awards, but what matters most to her are the children and families whose lives she has touched. Cheryl has been married to the love of her life Richard Pettibone for 29 years. They enjoy sharing adventures together, whether it's a safari in Africa or a hike on a local beach. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor Cheryl Jennings, a first-rate journalist and extraordinary woman whom I am honored to call a dear friend. I know that she will continue her outstanding work on the air and off the air. Cheryl is a true treasure to her family, our local community and the world. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1718] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF CHERYL JENNINGS ______ HON.

Many stories have been written and produced about this horrendous epidemic, but it was Cheryl Jennings who produced, wrote and reported the most comprehensive and powerful piece on the subject that I have seen. Cheryl learned the value of hard work, perseverance and public service early on. She was one of seven children born to a father who served in the U.S. Army and a mother who raised her and her siblings. As the oldest, Cheryl had lots of opportunity to change diapers, feed and take care of babies. The military sent Cheryl's family all over the world. By the time she started high school, she had changed schools more than a dozen times. She says that part was tough, but prepared her well for life in TV. Her original plans to become a teacher changed when she started college at City College of San Francisco. Her advisor told her to look for another career path because there were too many teachers. Cheryl interviewed two very rare women for a story in the college newspaper. They both worked in television, on air--almost unheard of in that era. The rest is history. Reporting was not an easy path. While she was earning her Bachelor's degree from San Francisco State University, she was rejected for volunteer-entry-level positions at TV stations 19 out of 20 times. Finally, a woman at the local NBC station hired her to work 50 hours a week while she continued to go to school. Her pay? Nothing. But her hard work and perseverance eventually paid off. The NBC station hired her as a paid receptionist, she worked her way into the newsroom, and in 1979, KGO TV hired her as a night reporter. The entire Bay Area became her classroom and she has taught her lessons exceptionally well. Cheryl has travelled the world to tell stories--Mexico, Kosovo, Afghanistan, South Africa, Korea, Israel and the West Bank. Here at home, one of the most memorable stories she covered was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. She was the first local reporter on the air thanks to the station's quick power generator. KGO's coverage earned the team two of the most prestigious broadcast awards, a George Foster Peabody Award and the Radio Television News Directors Association Edward R. Murrow Award. Cheryl says this was the moment she understood just how vital television is in providing public service. Doing good is what drives Cheryl. In 2003, she co-founded the Roots for Peace Children's Penny Campaign, a non-profit that removes landmines in war-torn countries and builds and repairs schools. She works with the Taylor Family Foundation and the Okizu Foundation to help children with life-threatening illnesses. She lends her voice and passion to many non-profit events that raise awareness and funds. All of this amazing work has earned Cheryl many awards, including six Gracie Awards, but what matters most to her are the children and families whose lives she has touched. Cheryl has been married to the love of her life Richard Pettibone for 29 years. They enjoy sharing adventures together, whether it's a safari in Africa or a hike on a local beach. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor Cheryl Jennings, a first-rate journalist and extraordinary woman whom I am honored to call a dear friend. I know that she will continue her outstanding work on the air and off the air. Cheryl is a true treasure to her family, our local community and the world. ____________________",package_114_35.csv,5056,5056,5126,"[congressional record volume 161, number 176 (monday, december 7, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1718] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in recognition of cheryl jennings ______ hon. jackie speier of california in the house of representatives monday, december 7, 2015 ms. speier. mr. speaker, i rise to honor one of the most recognizable, watched and listened-to women in the bay area: cheryl jennings has been in the 5 o'clock news anchor chair at abc7 kgo-tv for 27 years and worked at the station for 36 years. it is safe to say that she is one of the most trusted and admired reporters/anchors in our area and i am one of her staunchest fans. cheryl is ostensibly slowing down, but not quite. she will continue to host her weekend show beyond the headlines and report more long-format stories like the series she recently did in afghanistan. over the decades cheryl has reported on just about every topic, but all of her stories have one thing in common: she always finds an angle to help people. cheryl is one of the most giving, empathetic and genuine people i know. the word ``no'' doesn't exist in her vocabulary. i have had the distinct honor to work with cheryl on countless occasions. for years, she has been the masterful emcee at professional businesswomen of california and other programs. she has been the keynote speaker at my congressional events for middleschoolers and seniors. as a journalist, she is warm and inviting, but always professional and insistent on the truth. i took on the issue of rape and sexual assault in the military about five years ago. many stories have been written and produced about this horrendous epidemic, but it was cheryl jennings who produced, wrote and reported the most comprehensive and powerful piece on the subject that i have seen. cheryl learned the value of hard work, perseverance and public service early on. she was one of seven children born to a father who served in the u.s. army and a mother who raised her and her siblings. as the oldest, cheryl had lots of opportunity to change diapers, feed and take care of babies. the military sent cheryl's family all over the world. by the time she started high school, she had changed schools more than a dozen times. she says that part was tough, but prepared her well for life in tv. her original plans to become a teacher changed when she started college at city college of san francisco. her advisor told her to look for another career path because there were too many teachers. cheryl interviewed two very rare women for a story in the college newspaper. they both worked in television, on air--almost unheard of in that era. the rest is history. reporting was not an easy path. while she was earning her bachelor's degree from san francisco state university, she was rejected for volunteer-entry-level positions at tv stations 19 out of 20 times. finally, a woman at the local nbc station hired her to work 50 hours a week while she continued to go to school. her pay?

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today to recognize the importance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). As a graduate of the Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University (FAMU), I know all too well the importance HBCUs play in the fabric of our country. They prepare students for careers that span all disciplines, teach students the value of self-worth, the importance of culture, history, and legacy. Growing up during a time when colleges were not readily available for African-Americans, HBCUs played a vital role in educating African American youth. They continue to play an important role in educating students from all walks of life. They offer students, regardless of race, an opportunity to develop their skills and talents to serve both domestically and internationally. According to the United Negro College Fund. HBCUs are responsible for producing approximately 70% of all black doctors and dentists, 50% of black engineers and public school teachers, and 35% of black lawyers. I am extremely proud of all the HBCU Caucus is doing to recognize the importance of HBCUs and proud to be a member of the caucus. As a member of the caucus and an HBCU alumnus, I am committed to continue funding these critical institutions and ensuring our nation's youth have access to quality affordable education. Mr. Speaker, I once again want to stress the importance of HBCUs and urge my colleagues to continue to support them. They are the bedrock of our nation and symbolic of how our nation came together to ensure all students have access to quality affordable education. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1718] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LEGACY AND IMPORTANCE OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES (HBCUs) ______ HON.

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, on December 4th I had the pleasure of attending at the invitation of Ambassador Mai Sayavongs a celebration of both the sixtieth anniversary of diplomatic relations between Laos and the United States and the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. The event was well attended by ASEAN ambassadors and key U.S. officials including Mr. Ben Rhodes from the White House and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Daniel Russel. Over the course of these six decades there have been many difficult passages in the bilateral relationship. Today, I look forward and it is my belief that the relationship between the United States and the Lao PDR will improve, strengthen and grow in importance. For me, U.S-Lao relations has a direct impact on the thousands of Hmong and Lao Americans I represent in St. Paul and the surrounding East metro suburbs. It has been forty years since the first refugees from Southeast Asia arrived in Minnesota, but the family, cultural, and economic ties to Laos continue to be very important. As Laos becomes more engaged in the global economy, respects the rule of law, and embraces human rights for all its citizens my constituents feel more comfortable and more excited about returning to their ancestral homeland. In the coming year Laos will become chair ASEAN and it is expected that President Obama will be the first U.S. president to visit Laos. It is critical that the U.S. encourage the Lao government to make the necessary reforms that will allow its people to escape poverty and contribute to the long-term success of [[Page E1719]] their country. The lethal legacy of U.S. dropped unexploded ordinance from the era of the Vietnam War continues to plague the Lao people. UXO are a constant reminder of the obligation we have as a government to clean up a mess that continues to kill innocent Lao citizens and impedes economic development on lands all across Laos. It is my feeling that dialogue, cooperation, and common interests will allow the U.S.-Lao bilateral relations to improve significantly in 2016. Both the Obama Administration and Ambassador Sayavongs have my full support in this goal. The following are remarks I delivered at the December 4th celebration of U.S.-Lao Relations. Good evening. Ambassador Sayavongs and Madam Sayavongs, I am honored to be with you tonight to celebrate sixty years of diplomatic relations between our countries, as well as the fortieth anniversary of the Lao PDR. My relationship with the people of Laos is very special and I strongly support strengthening our bilateral relations. My home is Minnesota. In my congressional district, I represent tens of thousands of Hmong and Lao-Americans who call Laos their ancestral home. They have family in Laos. Their traditions come from Laos. And, they care deeply about the future of Laos. More than anyone, I would like to acknowledge Mr. Chao Lee who has been on my congressional staff since 2001, for guiding me and advising me. He is with us tonight and I would like to thank him for his work on behalf of U.S.-Lao relations. Over my fifteen years serving in Congress I have taken many steps to strengthen this relationship. I was a supporter of normalized trade relations with Laos at a time when many people were fighting about the past rather than working to build a new future. I have always supported increased U.S. funding for UXO clean--a terrible legacy of war that harms the Lao people. And, in 2006, I had the pleasure of celebrating a very special Christmas in Vientiane during a visit to your beautiful country. Ambassador, I am committed to working with you to strengthen our future together. We will work as partners to address issues important to both our countries--economic development, increased trade, and access GSP, as well as improving human rights and human development to ensure that all Lao people, including women and girls, are free to live full, productive lives. Ambassador, I wish your government much success as Laos chairs ASEAN next year. I know the Obama Administration will work as a partner to ensure next year's ASEAN Summit is a success and they will have my full support. Again, congratulations Mr. Ambassador on your country's 40 years. Thank you. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1718-E1719] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING SIXTY YEARS OF U.S.-LAO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ______ HON.

CREC-2015-12-07-pt1-PgE1719,CREC-2015-12-07,114,HONORING GEORGE BURKE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1719-E1720] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING GEORGE BURKE ______ HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY of virginia in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember and honor a dear friend and colleague, George Burke. Full of passion and energy, he dedicated his life to fighting for our progressive Democratic values. A trusted, wise and gifted political mind, George's vision and leadership helped build and grow our Democratic Party of Virginia. A man of many talents, he was an accomplished journalist, photographer, congressional staffer, senior labor leader with the International Association of Fire Fighters, the Chair of the 11th Congressional District Democratic Committee, and my trusted confidant and Communications Director. A constituent and friend of both George and mine, Mike Burke Kirby, recently endeavored to interview many of those who knew George and capture what George meant to so many. I submit Mr. Kirby's eloquent tribute to George. For more than 30 years I have been fortunate to call George my close friend. We will all miss his stories, his unwavering optimistic approach to life, and his love for his friends and family. His loss will leave a great void in all our lives and I will miss him dearly. I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering George Burke. George Burke [1951-2015] (By Mike Burke Kirby, Former Chair Fairfax County Democratic Committee) With all of his spirit, I thought George Burke was going to keep beating cancer for another ten years. He certainly had ten more years of wisdom and advice, laughter and courage for all of us. After centuries of subjugation on their own island, many Irish Americans were conditioned to thrive in politics in this huge nation of democracy. Fighting for their own freedom here, and for the rights of other minorities and women. Those include Gerry Connolly and Jim Moran. George has been a hero in many of those fights. George was a ``Connector,'' like Paul Revere. Many people rode from Boston to tell people that the British were sending troops west from the city. For weeks, panicky calls were made. Finally, they only listened to Paul Revere because everyone knew and trusted him. George knew 50 times as many people as you and!. They all thought George was one of the best people they ever met. George never seemed to parse the issue differences among Democrats. He simply thought that any Democrat was more of a democrat than any Republican He fought to make sure the nominating processes were fair. With a nominee, he put his shoulder to the wheel. The print and broadcast media industries declined early in the 21st Century. When George got young people, journalists, press staff and politicians, into the ``Burke Zone,'' he mentored them into the integrity and responsibility, the professionalism and punctuality from that loss. George's effect on Hill staffers was evident the week after his death--with a hundred young faces gathered outside of Rayburn Building for a memorial. For those who lived through the 1960s, the memory of Civil Rights, the Viet Nam War, the draft, the Kennedy and King Assassinations, the demonstrations, the politics and music can all come through with just a few words, which mean little to later generations. Many of us shared that with George, especially Gerry Connolly who was with him daily for many years. George often bragged about his independent ways, including his own travel routes. In the Snowmagedon, George left the office well after Gerry and James. Six hours after they left DC, the two were only at Bailey's Crossroads, and on a radio station by phone. George called to say ``hi.'' He had been home already, far beyond Bailey's, had a coffee from Starbucks and was on his way back to Sears to buy a washing machine on sale. Gerry asked where he was; actually George could see them from his inbound car across the street. After a broken neck George's hearing suffered enough that he couldn't pick up the vibrator on his phone. So, he never turned off the sound. In a medium sized event with President Obama, George's phone went off. With everybody looking, he answered it. It was Rachel. An ``8 X 10 Glossy'' Penny called him, with vast brain power, a pure political analyst and tactician. A total friend who always remained common, who persevered with a lot more than grace through four bouts with cancer. He attended all of her weekly campaign staff meetings until he went into the hospital for the last time. George held court at the Mason District Crab Feast. The next day, he showed up again to help dismantle the ``God awful tent.'' Even with the broken neck he still came to sit under the porch and spin tales. Rachel pestered him early to write the Mason Precinct Letter. George waited until the issues were ripe. Letters almost always perfect. Mark Levine got George into Public Access TV, where he covered local politics. The stage may have been small; but George covered it like Dan Rather. He was proud of a large new set, and was completely unfazed when the lighting panel dropped and other parts of the set disintegrated, George's last student, Jake, was grateful for the little time he was able to spend with George. No conversation, no detail, and definitely no person was too big for George--it all mattered to him. Over their 20 to 30 to 90 to 180 minute phone conversations, everything mattered Every question deserves a well thought out response, every roadblock mandates a thoroughly strategized plan to go around it. George's main lesson, looking back on it, was to ``pay attention'' and not to let any opportunity, no matter how small, be wasted. George hosted the debate among the seven Democratic candidates for the 8th Congressional District nomination in 2014. On the race, he gave political advice to all of them. George spent 16 years as head of Communications at the International Association of Fire Fighters, a job he loved and talked about all the time. Even after he left the IAFF, at every big political dinner, no matter what other hat he was wearing, he always sat at the Fire Fighters table. He served with the Fire Fighters through September 11. In Fairfax County, the Fire Fighters called George a mastermind. After years of failing to get a federal grant for the Safety for an Adequate Fire Emergency Response, George and Gerry Connolly stepped in. They now have a grant for millions of dollars that gives the County 49 additional staff on ladder trucks. George took care of any issue, knew how the legislatures work and could always find a way to fix any problem. John Niemiec, said as a friend, George even helped people get recommendations. Dan Duncan was Communications Director for the Seafarers Union, while George was president of the International Labor Communications Association. George worked hard to get labor press respected both within the union movement and among the general media. They were all propagandists of one kind or another because, if they didn't promote their members, they certainly could not expect any one else to do so. George understood that and worked hard to transition labor media from membership newspapers and magazines to the emerging world of what would become social media. Dan Duncan knew George when he was on the 11th District Democratic Committee, [[Page E1720]] which George chaired. When Dan presided at the NoVA Labor Federation, George knew the numbers and he knew the people. He worked hard for consensus, but allowed those with opposing views about candidates and/or issues to get their points across without folks becoming alarmed or challenged. Long discussions with Cathy Hoffman, a boss at Liberty Mountain Resort in near Gettysburg, of the triumphs and challenges of their teenage kids. Many stories of George, the very patient instructor of the most timid skiers. Many ski instructors are prima donnas, but not George. George's name is still on the instructor schedule at Liberty for this winter They can't seem to take it off. Kelly Kurtyka also instructed at Liberty. She tried her son, Spenser, at skiing at the age of three. His response of ``It's really cold, Mommy'' devastated her. The next year, Cathy put Spencer with George Burke. ``Mr. George'' worked on his own time and waved his magic wands, and Spencer joined his family as a great skier. George brought him stuff from skiing in Switzerland, and Spencer drew pictures of him in school. After George travelled across the U.S., he met Sharon the Nurse, who, ``took him into the woods.'' Great couple for hiking, kayaking, camping in New England. Not many spouses are blessed with a partner who loves the outdoors so. That worked really well for Sharon and George for 45 years. With different knee and ankle strengths, Sharon lost her downhill ability, but cross country skied a lot. George was better at downhill and loved it, and taught it. Still, he often cross country skied with Sharon. None of us can quite remember what George was like before he had two cell phones, on in any environment. With the blue tooth in his ear in New England, a little kid walking down the beach noticed that his arm was raised: George's hand with the phone in it, way up to get better reception. An hour later the kid came back and noticed that George's arm was still in the air. George and Sharon were a team, and you could see that whenever and wherever they were together, more often at Labor events than political ones. While folks in local politics never knew where he got the time, George was a five star dad. He changed the diapers. Mom nursed on the weekends and dad was full time. Skiing of course, but also an indulgence in swimming, crew, marching band at Jeb Stuart. The Burke kids loved the outdoors with their parents. None of George's kids got the political infection. But they did get his love of music: the Allman Brothers, Eric Clapton, B.B. King. They still mostly do the music. The youngest however follows more rap and ski boarding. Family holidays were always a very big event with them. Sharon will especially miss the big holiday related events. In the spring, Sharon will take Georges' ashes on a two hour hike to his favorite ravine in New England. When you get the vocation for public service, it can be joyful and rewarding. But you will miss a lot, mostly your wife and kids; and they'll miss you. This is a great country for public service: on the Hill, for the union, and in state and local politics. For almost 250 years, this nation has followed the path to ever more democracy. Rarely as good as spending all your time with your family, and certainly better than leaving your family a fortune, you can leave them a better country to live in. George Burke very much did that. After he last got out of the hospital, George wanted a party, sort of an early Irish Wake. Some said he wanted his kids to know what he did; some that he wanted to critique whatever we all said. His editing eyes are very much on my shoulder. We will still have George's party, maybe in January. Lots more of the best we know of him and very little of grief. Do you know many people who had such a good run? Whenever I needed advice or had a question for 30+ years, every voice mail or e-mail got an immediate answer. Nobody else ever does that. In writing this, I spoke to more than 30 people. Not all were included specifically here; but they brought a flood of great adjectives. Everyone said ``true friend.'' The list of candidates and campaigners who got great advice from George would take many pages. If you are reading this, you are probably one of them. Whatever you think about after death, the memory of George is softly etched in all of our hearts. He will continue to live in each of us as we remember him almost every day.

George worked hard to get labor press respected both within the union movement and among the general media. They were all propagandists of one kind or another because, if they didn't promote their members, they certainly could not expect any one else to do so. George understood that and worked hard to transition labor media from membership newspapers and magazines to the emerging world of what would become social media. Dan Duncan knew George when he was on the 11th District Democratic Committee, [[Page E1720]] which George chaired. When Dan presided at the NoVA Labor Federation, George knew the numbers and he knew the people. He worked hard for consensus, but allowed those with opposing views about candidates and/or issues to get their points across without folks becoming alarmed or challenged. Long discussions with Cathy Hoffman, a boss at Liberty Mountain Resort in near Gettysburg, of the triumphs and challenges of their teenage kids. Many stories of George, the very patient instructor of the most timid skiers. Many ski instructors are prima donnas, but not George. George's name is still on the instructor schedule at Liberty for this winter They can't seem to take it off. Kelly Kurtyka also instructed at Liberty. She tried her son, Spenser, at skiing at the age of three. His response of ``It's really cold, Mommy'' devastated her. The next year, Cathy put Spencer with George Burke. ``Mr. George'' worked on his own time and waved his magic wands, and Spencer joined his family as a great skier. George brought him stuff from skiing in Switzerland, and Spencer drew pictures of him in school. After George travelled across the U.S., he met Sharon the Nurse, who, ``took him into the woods.'' Great couple for hiking, kayaking, camping in New England. Not many spouses are blessed with a partner who loves the outdoors so. That worked really well for Sharon and George for 45 years. With different knee and ankle strengths, Sharon lost her downhill ability, but cross country skied a lot. George was better at downhill and loved it, and taught it. Still, he often cross country skied with Sharon. None of us can quite remember what George was like before he had two cell phones, on in any environment. With the blue tooth in his ear in New England, a little kid walking down the beach noticed that his arm was raised: George's hand with the phone in it, way up to get better reception. An hour later the kid came back and noticed that George's arm was still in the air. George and Sharon were a team, and you could see that whenever and wherever they were together, more often at Labor events than political ones. While folks in local politics never knew where he got the time, George was a five star dad. He changed the diapers. Mom nursed on the weekends and dad was full time. Skiing of course, but also an indulgence in swimming, crew, marching band at Jeb Stuart. The Burke kids loved the outdoors with their parents. None of George's kids got the political infection. But they did get his love of music: the Allman Brothers, Eric Clapton, B.B. King. They still mostly do the music. The youngest however follows more rap and ski boarding. Family holidays were always a very big event with them. Sharon will especially miss the big holiday related events. In the spring, Sharon will take Georges' ashes on a two hour hike to his favorite ravine in New England. When you get the vocation for public service, it can be joyful and rewarding. But you will miss a lot, mostly your wife and kids; and they'll miss you. This is a great country for public service: on the Hill, for the union, and in state and local politics. For almost 250 years, this nation has followed the path to ever more democracy. Rarely as good as spending all your time with your family, and certainly better than leaving your family a fortune, you can leave them a better country to live in. George Burke very much did that. After he last got out of the hospital, George wanted a party, sort of an early Irish Wake. Some said he wanted his kids to know what he did; some that he wanted to critique whatever we all said. His editing eyes are very much on my shoulder. We will still have George's party, maybe in January. Lots more of the best we know of him and very little of grief. Do you know many people who had such a good run? Whenever I needed advice or had a question for 30+ years, every voice mail or e-mail got an immediate answer. Nobody else ever does that. In writing this, I spoke to more than 30 people. Not all were included specifically here; but they brought a flood of great adjectives. Everyone said ``true friend.'' The list of candidates and campaigners who got great advice from George would take many pages. If you are reading this, you are probably one of them. Whatever you think about after death, the memory of George is softly etched in all of our hearts. He will continue to live in each of us as we remember him almost every day.

george burke ______ hon. gerald e. connolly of virginia in the house of representatives monday, december 7, 2015 mr. connolly. mr. speaker, i rise to remember and honor a dear friend and colleague, george burke. full of passion and energy, he dedicated his life to fighting for our progressive democratic values. a trusted, wise and gifted political mind, george's vision and leadership helped build and grow our democratic party of virginia. a man of many talents, he was an accomplished journalist, photographer, congressional staffer, senior labor leader with the international association of fire fighters, the chair of the 11th congressional district democratic committee, and my trusted confidant and communications director. a constituent and friend of both george and mine, mike burke kirby, recently endeavored to interview many of those who knew george and capture what george meant to so many. i submit mr. kirby's eloquent tribute to george. for more than 30 years i have been fortunate to call george my close friend. we will all miss his stories, his unwavering optimistic approach to life, and his love for his friends and family. his loss will leave a great void in all our lives and i will miss him dearly. i ask my colleagues to join me in remembering george burke. george burke [1951-2015] (by mike burke kirby, former chair fairfax county democratic committee) with all of his spirit, i thought george burke was going to keep beating cancer for another ten years. he certainly had ten more years of wisdom and advice, laughter and courage for all of us. after centuries of subjugation on their own island, many irish americans were conditioned to thrive in politics in this huge nation of democracy. fighting for their own freedom here, and for the rights of other minorities and women. those include gerry connolly and jim moran. george has been a hero in many of those fights. george was a ``connector,'' like paul revere. many people rode from boston to tell people that the british were sending troops west from the city. for weeks, panicky calls were made. finally, they only listened to paul revere because everyone knew and trusted him. george knew 50 times as many people as you and!. they all thought george was one of the best people they ever met. george never seemed to parse the issue differences among democrats. he simply thought that any democrat was more of a democrat than any republican he fought to make sure the nominating processes were fair. with a nominee, he put his shoulder to the wheel. the print and broadcast media industries declined early in the 21st century. when george got young people, journalists, press staff and politicians, into the ``burke zone,'' he mentored them into the integrity and responsibility, the professionalism and punctuality from that loss. george's effect on hill staffers was evident the week after his death--with a hundred young faces gathered outside of rayburn building for a memorial. for those who lived through the 1960s, the memory of civil rights, the viet nam war, the draft, the kennedy and king assassinations, the demonstrations, the politics and music can all come through with just a few words, which mean little to later generations. many of us shared that with george, especially gerry connolly who was with him daily for many years. george often bragged about his independent ways, including his own travel routes. in the snowmagedon, george left the office well after gerry and james. six hours after they left dc, the two were only at bailey's crossroads, and on a radio station by phone. george called to say ``hi.'' he had been home already, far beyond bailey's, had a coffee from starbucks and was on his way back to sears to buy a washing machine on sale. gerry asked where he was; actually george could see them from his inbound car across the street. after a broken neck george's hearing suffered enough that he couldn't pick up the vibrator on his phone. so, he never turned off the sound. in a medium sized event with president obama, george's phone went off. with everybody looking, he answered it. it was rachel. an ``8 x 10 glossy'' penny called him, with vast brain power, a pure political analyst and tactician. a total friend who always remained common, who persevered with a lot more than grace through four bouts with cancer. he attended all of her weekly campaign staff meetings until he went into the hospital for the last time. george held court at the mason district crab feast. the next day, he showed up again to help dismantle the ``god awful tent.'' even with the broken neck he still came to sit under the porch and spin tales. rachel pestered him early to write the mason precinct letter. george waited until the issues were ripe. letters almost always perfect. mark levine got george into public access tv, where he covered local politics. the stage may have been small; but george covered it like dan rather. he was proud of a large new set, and was completely unfazed when the lighting panel dropped and other parts of the set disintegrated, george's last student, jake, was grateful for the little time he was able to spend with george. no conversation, no detail, and definitely no person was too big for george--it all mattered to him. over their 20 to 30 to 90 to 180 minute phone conversations, everything mattered every question deserves a well thought out response, every roadblock mandates a thoroughly strategized plan to go around it. george's main lesson, looking back on it, was to ``pay attention'' and not to let any opportunity, no matter how small, be wasted. george hosted the debate among the seven democratic candidates for the 8th congressional district nomination in 2014. on the race, he gave political advice to all of them. george spent 16 years as head of communications at the international association of fire fighters, a job he loved and talked about all the time. even after he left the iaff, at every big political dinner, no matter what other hat he was wearing, he always sat at the fire fighters table. he served with the fire fighters through september 11. in fairfax county, the fire fighters called george a mastermind. after years of failing to get a federal grant for the safety for an adequate fire emergency response, george and gerry connolly stepped in. they now have a grant for millions of dollars that gives the county 49 additional staff on ladder trucks. george took care of any issue, knew how the legislatures work and could always find a way to fix any problem. john niemiec, said as a friend, george even helped people get recommendations. dan duncan was communications director for the seafarers union, while george was president of the international labor communications association. george worked hard to get labor press respected both within the union movement and among the general media. they were all propagandists of one kind or another because, if they didn't promote their members, they certainly could not expect any one else to do so. george understood that and worked hard to transition labor media from membership

JOSE HURTADO ______ HON. MIKE THOMPSON of california in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jose Hurtado, a faculty member at Napa Valley College, who is retiring this month after 38 years of service. Mr. Hurtado's family immigrated to the United States in 1958. I had the pleasure of growing up with Jose, who went on to earn degrees from Napa Valley College, UC Davis, and Sacramento State College. He was the first in his family to earn college degrees, and his younger siblings quickly followed his lead. In 1977, Mr. Hurtado began work as a counseling assistant at Napa Valley College. In 1980, he became the first Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) Counselor hired to a tenure-track position. Nine years later, in 1989, Mr. Hurtado moved to the Counseling Department. He subsequently served as Division Chair of Napa Valley College's Counseling Department, before working temporarily as the school's Coordinator of the non-Credit Matriculation Program. In 2003, Mr. Hurtado moved back to General Counseling on the Napa campus, and began working with the school's student-athletes in 2010. In 2013, Mr. Hurtado became Coordinator of the combined Career and Transfer Programs at Napa Valley College. Over the course of his 38-year career, Mr. Hurtado earned numerous awards and accolades. He was elected to the Napa Valley Unified School District Governing Board in 2004, and in 2011, he joined Community Action Napa Valley, an organization of which he is currently Chairman. Last year, Mr. Hurtado was appointed by California Governor Jerry Brown to the Napa Valley Expo Board of Directors, and in 2015, he became a member of the Napa County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Looking back, Mr. Hurtado is especially proud of his children and grandchildren, his U.S. citizenship, and his election to the school board. His children's weddings remain among Mr. Hurtado's happiest moments. He remains lovably quirky to the community, reading four newspapers every Sunday and cheerfully interacting with Napa Valley students on a daily basis. Next year, Mr. Hurtado plans to complete a 500-mile trek on Spain's ancient Camino de Santiago trail. Mr. Speaker, Jose Hurtado has devoted nearly 40 years to his community and to the education of our young people. He has demonstrated exceptional character, confidence, and compassion, and his community has benefitted enormously from his efforts. For these reasons and others, it is fitting and proper that we honor him here today. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1720] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims who were killed during the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941--a date which will live in infamy. Seventy-four years ago today, more than 2,000 American citizens lost their lives and more than 1,000 others were injured in a surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The attack on Pearl Harbor shook our nation to its core. Up until this point, the United States had largely remained neutral during the Second World War. However, as a testament to our strength and our resolve, the United States declared war against the Japanese and entered World War II just one day following the attack. Contrary to what the Japanese had intended, the attack had only emboldened our nation to forge our own path to victory. Tragedies such as the attack on Pearl Harbor serve as a stark reminder of the great personal sacrifices that our men and women in uniform must make in the service of protecting our nation. While many soldiers are fortunate enough to return from service, plenty of others have given up their lives in the act of duty. We are forever indebted to these men and women who have given their lives to protect our freedoms and way of life. Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day is also about paying tribute to those who served--and survived--during the attack. Petty Officer Doris ``Dorie'' Miller was one such American who fought bravely during the conflict. Petty Officer Miller displayed remarkable courage when his ship, the USS West Virginia, came under attack. As the fighting occurred, Miller dragged his ship's commander, who was mortally wounded by shrapnel, out of the line of fire to safety. He then manned a 50- caliber Browning anti-aircraft machine gun and shot down at least three of the 29 Japanese planes that went down that day until he was ordered to abandon ship. While Petty Officer Miller survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, he sadly lost his life during a second attack during the Battle of Makin Island when a Japanese submarine and aircraft attack sunk his ship. Mr. Speaker, the attack on Pearl Harbor was a defining moment in United States history. Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day helps to remind us of the importance of defending our freedoms and the heavy cost of doing so. We are reminded on this day of those who lost their lives, but also the countless other veterans--such as Dorie Miller--who have made [[Page E1721]] invaluable contributions to our success during the Second World War. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1720-E1721] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PEARL HARBOR REMEMBRANCE DAY ______ HON.

We are reminded on this day of those who lost their lives, but also the countless other veterans--such as Dorie Miller--who have made [[Page E1721]] invaluable contributions to our success during the Second World War. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1720-E1721] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PEARL HARBOR REMEMBRANCE DAY ______ HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims who were killed during the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941--a date which will live in infamy. Seventy-four years ago today, more than 2,000 American citizens lost their lives and more than 1,000 others were injured in a surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The attack on Pearl Harbor shook our nation to its core. Up until this point, the United States had largely remained neutral during the Second World War. However, as a testament to our strength and our resolve, the United States declared war against the Japanese and entered World War II just one day following the attack. Contrary to what the Japanese had intended, the attack had only emboldened our nation to forge our own path to victory. Tragedies such as the attack on Pearl Harbor serve as a stark reminder of the great personal sacrifices that our men and women in uniform must make in the service of protecting our nation. While many soldiers are fortunate enough to return from service, plenty of others have given up their lives in the act of duty. We are forever indebted to these men and women who have given their lives to protect our freedoms and way of life. Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day is also about paying tribute to those who served--and survived--during the attack. Petty Officer Doris ``Dorie'' Miller was one such American who fought bravely during the conflict. Petty Officer Miller displayed remarkable courage when his ship, the USS West Virginia, came under attack. As the fighting occurred, Miller dragged his ship's commander, who was mortally wounded by shrapnel, out of the line of fire to safety. He then manned a 50- caliber Browning anti-aircraft machine gun and shot down at least three of the 29 Japanese planes that went down that day until he was ordered to abandon ship. While Petty Officer Miller survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, he sadly lost his life during a second attack during the Battle of Makin Island when a Japanese submarine and aircraft attack sunk his ship. Mr. Speaker, the attack on Pearl Harbor was a defining moment in United States history.

I would also like to personally thank him for his years of service working to better the city of Lodi and the state of California. Raised in California's state capitol, Sacramento, Alan attended Lincoln School and Jr. High School. In 8th grade, he joined the Boy Scouts of America where he learned many valuable life lessons including always being prepared. Alan successfully reached the rank of First Class and desired to become an Eagle Scout; however, he chose to be involved in sports instead. With much respect for the Boy Scouts of America program, Alan still actively participates by being a speaker for several clubs. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from Pacific Union College in 1961, Alan continued on to study at the Loma Linda University graduating in 1965 with his Medical Degree. He completed both his medical internship and Ophthalmology Residency from the University of Southern California Medical Center. He later received his Masters of Health Administration from the Virginia Commonwealth University and the Medical College of Virginia in 1990 and 1991. During Alan's early life, he served as a Captain in the United States Army where he was stationed in Texas. After earning his medical degree he served another two years as Major and led the surgical department as Chief of Ophthalmology for the McDonald Army Hospital in Fort Eustis, Virginia.

His time in Assembly ended in 2008, and in 2010, Alan was elected to rejoin the Lodi City Council. Only two short years later he was selected again to serve as the Mayor of Lodi.

LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD of california in the house of representatives Monday, December 7, 2015 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my sister, Lillian Roybal Rose, who made a career of leading nationally acclaimed cross-cultural leadership awareness seminars and workshops which fostered greater understanding between people of diverse backgrounds, and helped lay a foundation for a more peaceful multicultural future. For over 35 years, Lillian taught her workshops to academic, corporate, civic, and community groups. Her ultimate goal was to increase participants' self-awareness and help them establish mutual understanding and respect for others. She did this by creating a safe and supportive environment for participants to learn how internalized oppression affects thinking and attitudes, and how the resulting patterns of behavior affect communication between individuals, within groups, and between groups. When Lillian developed this workshop in the late 1970s, it turned the then-current diversity training model of ``blame and shame'' on its head. Her workshops relied on practical theoretical models based on psychology and ethics, and on interactive and experiential activities that allowed participants not merely to engage their minds but to open their hearts. This workshop approach, coupled with Lillian's ability to see and bring out the best in people, helped participants build powerful frameworks for effective long-term cooperation and communication, and enabled them to reclaim pride in their roots through the exploration of shared experiences. Lillian understood that the key to appreciating others is developing a better understanding of ourselves. When we can define and recognize forms of oppression that affect all of us, we can begin to relate to each other as individuals and build alliances. Over and over again, I have met individuals from across the country who have expressed their gratitude for my sister's work. Those who have participated in her workshops have told me countless times, ``She has changed my life and made me a better person.'' While my sister is retired and no longer presents her workshops, she has been convinced by many of those same participants to give a farewell presentation. On December 12th and December 13th on the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara, Lillian will present an encore workshop. People from different parts of the country will again be there to experience Lillian's brilliance, compassion, authenticity, and humility as she takes this final opportunity to share her life's work. Lillian has said of the people who participated in her workshops, ``We gave, and continue to give each other support and hope that we can reach a fair and just society, where all can be treated with dignity and respect, have equal opportunity, and where we can love and celebrate our differences. My love and thank you to all.'' Mr. Speaker, I have been blessed to have Lillian as my sister, and I am proud to join Lillian's colleagues and friends for her encore workshop and in honoring her life's work. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 176 (Monday, December 7, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1721] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BECAUSE WE ALL NEED MORE HUMAN CONNECTION: HONORING THE WORK OF LILLIAN ROYBAL ROSE ______ HON.
