HERBERT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8624] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL ROBERT T. HERBERT Mr. REID. Madam President, on a note that I feel important to make for my staff and me, it is important to recognize the accomplishments of everyone here in Washington, here on Capitol Hill, here in the Senate; it is important to recognize the accomplishments of our staff. We have such remarkably dedicated people. I am so proud of my staff. They have worked this past week tirelessly. I want to talk today, though, about just one of those who has worked for me. His name is BG Robert T. Herbert. He came to me as a congressional fellow two decades ago, and he never left. He was so good. This month marks the 40th year of General Herbert's service in the United States Armed Forces. In 1975, he joined the Army and embarked on a remarkable military career. He grew up in a military family and always dreamed of becoming a military aviator. He made that dream a reality, logging over 7,000 flight hours in all different kinds of aircraft--fixed-wing and rotary--spending time in virtually every aircraft within the United States Army inventory. As with all pilots, as they get a little older and have different assignments, they just can't stand the fact that they can't fly as they used to. So he no longer spends his days in the cockpit when he does his duties at the National Guard. He is Special Assistant to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau for National Security Policy here in Washington. He previously worked as Nevada's assistant adjunct general. I am grateful for Bob's service to our Nation. A 40-year military career is an incredible achievement. But I am also thankful for his work here in the Senate. He has been a tireless worker for the people of Nevada and for the country. Congratulations to BG Robert T. Herbert on this important milestone, and I look forward to his many other accomplishments as Bob's illustrious career continues. Would the Presiding Officer announce to the Senate what we are going to be doing the rest of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8624] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL ROBERT T.

CREC-2015-12-14-pt1-PgS8625,CREC-2015-12-14,114,FREEDOM OF RELIGION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8625-S8626] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FREEDOM OF RELIGION Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is interesting--the Midwest draws us together in the right way. Last night in Springfield, IL, a typical midwestern American city, there was a gathering of people from all across the city at 5:30 on a Sunday night. It was a gathering at the Islamic Society of Springfield. A request had been made for people of all religions to come together and to pray in solidarity with our Islamic neighbors. It was billed as a peace rally originally scheduled to be held outside, even in winter weather. Although it has been warm for this time of year, it was raining heavy last night as we all arrived at the building, so everyone crammed inside the building. There was standing and sitting room only. It was a huge outpouring of support for our Muslim brothers and sisters in the Springfield community. There were representatives of virtually every religion present, and many spoke--rabbis, ministers, Catholic nuns, and even a few elected officials--trying to let our friends in the Muslim community know that despite some of the things that had been said over the last few weeks by Presidential candidates, we in fact embrace them as part of the American family. There was also an event this weekend that occurred far away from Springfield, in Scottsdale, AZ, where my colleague in the Senate, Jeff Flake of Arizona, visited a mosque. It was widely reported. He made outstanding remarks about the regret he felt over some of the political statements that had been made over the last several weeks by political candidates. Jeff Flake reminded us across the Nation, as I tried to remind those in Springfield last night, that America is a nation which values the freedom of religious belief. Our Constitution speaks to only three elements when it comes to religion and our government. First, it says that each of us has the freedom and liberty to choose our own religion or to choose no religion. Second, it says our government will never establish an official state religion. Third, in article VI, it says there will be no religious test in the United States of America of candidates for public office. It is hard to believe that those three simple thoughts have carried this Nation for more than two centuries when it comes to religion, but we have been successful. Our Nation has been successful where others have failed. There have been times when we failed to live up to our own ideals and our own values, and when hateful statements are made by Presidential candidates, it calls on us to remember our history and to remember triumphant moments and sad moments as well. It was May of 1939 when the ship SS St. Louis left Germany with 900 Jewish passengers. They were trying to escape Hitler and the Nazis. They went to Havana, Cuba, and they were turned away. Then they came to Miami, FL, asking if they could be refugees, Jewish refugees, coming to the United States, and they were turned away as well. The 900 Jewish passengers went back to Germany. According to the records of the Holocaust Museum, 200 of them perished in the Holocaust. It was about that same time when Senator Robert Wagner of New York offered a measure in the Senate--in this very Chamber--that our country would accept 10,000 Jewish children from Germany who were seeking to escape the Holocaust. Sadly, that measure was defeated. We have other instances in history that go back to the beginning of our Nation where we have been challenged to live up to the ideals and principles of the Constitution. That challenge is with us again today. A candidate for President of the United States--of a major political party--has called for the exclusion of Muslims from being allowed to immigrate into the United States. That is reprehensible, it is outrageous, and it is un-American. Members of both political parties in Congress have spoken out against it, as they should. We must remember that many of our Nation's Founders fled religious persecution to come to this Nation. George Washington summed up the prevailing view when he said, ``In this land of equal liberty, it is our boast, that a man's religious tenets will not forfeit the protection of the laws.'' That, of course, is included in the First Amendment to our Constitution. Throughout our history, many religious minorities have faced intolerance, often prejudice. It was once Catholics from Ireland, Italy, and my mother's homeland of Lithuania who were questioned. Today American Muslims face the same threats of similar discrimination. In recent weeks a number of prominent Republican leaders have made these threats. But I add quickly that there has been a greater number, thank goodness, who have spoken out against these statements, even on the Republican side. One Presidential candidate compared Syrian refugees to ``rabid dogs'' and said that American Muslims should not be President of the United States. The frontrunner for the Republican nomination called for a ``total and complete'' ban on Muslim immigrants coming to the United States and advocated for closing down their places of worship. These comments are reprehensible and do not reflect who we are as a nation. These comments also don't reflect the vital role that millions of Muslim Americans play in my hometown of Springfield, IL, and across the United States. There are American Muslims who are teachers, professors, doctors, police officers, first responders, and members of the U.S. Armed Forces. I am concerned that the anti-Muslim rhetoric we have heard in recent weeks could alienate the Muslim community and harm the important relationship between the community and Federal law enforcement. Last night, as I was leaving the gathering in Springfield, a mother pulled me aside and said she feared for her daughter who wears a hijab--a veil--and who may be the subject of discrimination because of the things that have been said by some of these Presidential candidates. It is important for us to understand her feelings, the love of her children, just as we love our own children and grandchildren, and to also realize that the feelings of the Muslim Americans are truly part of our Nation. Last night we began the gathering in Springfield, IL, pledging allegiance to the flag--all of us--and singing ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Then the first person to make remarks in the Muslim community told us he had served in the U.S. Navy for 19 years. It is hard to imagine some of the hateful things that have been said in that context. In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2004--not long after 9/11--FBI Director Robert Mueller thanked the Muslim and Arab American communities ``for their assistance and for their ongoing commitment to preventing acts of terrorism.'' It has been important to the United States. He went on to say: ``All of us understand that the evolving threats we face today, and those we will face tomorrow, can only be defeated if we work together.'' The current FBI Director, James Comey, spoke before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week and said: We've worked so hard over the last 15 years to build relationships of trust that allow us to find out who might be trouble and to stop it. That's in everybody's interest. And anything that gets in the way, that erodes that relationship of trust, is not a good thing. The inflammatory speeches we have heard create a fertile ground for discrimination. Attorney General Loretta Lynch recently denounced the ``disturbing rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric'' and stated that her ``greatest fear as a prosecutor . . . is that the rhetoric will be accompanied by acts of violence.'' Sitting next to me last night in Springfield was the U.S. attorney for the Central District of Illinois, James Lewis--a friend and someone I am very honored and proud to have nominated to the President for this position. He [[Page S8626]] told me he spent the last several weeks traveling across Central Illinois, visiting Muslim mosques and assuring them that they were still part of America and that they had the full protection of the law. Nevertheless, there has been a dramatic increase of anti-Muslim bigotry since 9/11. In fear and anger, some Americans have wrongly struck out at Muslims. I had my differences with former President George W. Bush, but he showed real insight, wisdom, and leadership after 9/11 when he made it clear to America that our war was with terrorists who perverted the teachings of the Islamic religion, not with Muslims who were faithful to what he called ``a faith based upon love, not hate.'' Congress at that time spoke with a clear voice too. I cosponsored a resolution with John Sununu, a Republican from New Hampshire, who was then the only Arab American in the Senate. Our resolution condemned anti-Muslim, anti-Arab bigotry, and said that American Muslims are vibrant, peaceful, law-abiding, and greatly contribute to American society. That resolution passed both Chambers unanimously. I hope it would pass today. Earlier this decade, we saw another wave of anti-Muslim rhetoric and discrimination. In 2011 I chaired the first ever congressional hearing on the civil rights of American Muslims. That hearing documented an alarming increase of anti-Muslim bigotry. At the time, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that Muslims accounted for approximately 25 percent of religious discrimination cases, although they were less than 1 percent of the population. Mary Jo O'Neill of the EEOC said: There's a level of hatred and animosity that is shocking. I've been doing this for 31 years, and I've never seen such antipathy towards Muslim workers. Unfortunately, we are again experiencing an increase in anti-Muslim discrimination. Last week Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League said, ``We're definitely seeing anti-Muslim bigotry escalating around the country.'' In recent weeks vandals defaced a mosque near Austin, TX; a pig's head was thrown on the doorstep of a Philadelphia mosque; a man was arrested for breaking into a Florida mosque and damaging property; a sixth grade girl in New York City was allegedly called ``ISIS'' as a group of boys punched her and tried to remove her hijab; and on Thanksgiving day a Muslim cabdriver from Pittsburgh was shot in the back by a passenger who reportedly asked the driver about ISIS and whether he was a ``Pakistani guy.'' Just this weekend a man in California was arrested and charged for a hate crime and arson after allegedly setting a fire in a mosque. Last week Representative Andre Carson--a Democrat from Indiana and one of the two American Muslims who serve in the U.S. Congress-- received a death threat. Here is what Congressman Carson said: You have other politicians who are joining the bandwagon and who are fanning the flames of bigotry. That concerns me because we're putting people into the line of fire exposing them to death threats, discrimination at the workplace and assaults. These incidents of intimidation, hostility, and violence impact the entire Muslim American community. They also play into our enemies' warped views of the United States. Director Comey of the FBI noted last week that ``the notion that the U.S. is anti-Muslim is part of ISIL's narrative and Al Qaeda's narrative.'' It is important to note that not only Muslim Americans are being targeted. Bigots have also targeted Arab Americans, many of whom are Christian, and Hindus, and Sikhs. After 9/11, the first victim killed in the backlash was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh American, in Mesa, AZ. I submitted a resolution, which passed the Senate unanimously, condemning bigotry against Sikh Americans. In 2012, a White supremacist murdered six Sikhs at a gurdwara in Oak Creek, WI. Following this terrorist attack, I chaired a hearing on hate crimes and the threat of domestic extremism where we learned that the FBI wasn't even tracking these crimes against Arab Americans, Hindu Americans, and Sikh Americans. I asked the FBI to change the policy, and they did. Clearly there is more work to be done. Last week, a vandal spray-painted anti-Muslim graffiti on a Sikh gurdwara in Buena Park, CA. In September, a Sikh man in my home State of Illinois suffered a fractured cheekbone after he was allegedly assaulted by a man who yelled ``terrorist'' and ``go back to your country'' at him. As we work to combat terrorism, we must also work to prevent and punish discrimination and hate-fueled violence against Muslim Americans. The rights of Muslim Americans are just as important as the rights of Christians, Jews, followers of other faiths, and nonbelievers as well. We know the First Amendment protects both the free exercise of religion and the freedom of speech. But all of us, especially those of us in public life, have a responsibility to choose our words carefully. We must condemn bias and bigotry aimed at Muslim Americans and make it clear that we will not tolerate religious discrimination in the United States of America. We can protect our Nation and still be true to the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold that suggestion? Mr. DURBIN. Yes. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8625-S8626] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FREEDOM OF RELIGION Mr. DURBIN.

Nevertheless, there has been a dramatic increase of anti-Muslim bigotry since 9/11. In fear and anger, some Americans have wrongly struck out at Muslims. I had my differences with former President George W. Bush, but he showed real insight, wisdom, and leadership after 9/11 when he made it clear to America that our war was with terrorists who perverted the teachings of the Islamic religion, not with Muslims who were faithful to what he called ``a faith based upon love, not hate.'' Congress at that time spoke with a clear voice too. I cosponsored a resolution with John Sununu, a Republican from New Hampshire, who was then the only Arab American in the Senate. Our resolution condemned anti-Muslim, anti-Arab bigotry, and said that American Muslims are vibrant, peaceful, law-abiding, and greatly contribute to American society. That resolution passed both Chambers unanimously. I hope it would pass today. Earlier this decade, we saw another wave of anti-Muslim rhetoric and discrimination. In 2011 I chaired the first ever congressional hearing on the civil rights of American Muslims. That hearing documented an alarming increase of anti-Muslim bigotry. At the time, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that Muslims accounted for approximately 25 percent of religious discrimination cases, although they were less than 1 percent of the population. Mary Jo O'Neill of the EEOC said: There's a level of hatred and animosity that is shocking. I've been doing this for 31 years, and I've never seen such antipathy towards Muslim workers. Unfortunately, we are again experiencing an increase in anti-Muslim discrimination. Last week Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League said, ``We're definitely seeing anti-Muslim bigotry escalating around the country.'' In recent weeks vandals defaced a mosque near Austin, TX; a pig's head was thrown on the doorstep of a Philadelphia mosque; a man was arrested for breaking into a Florida mosque and damaging property; a sixth grade girl in New York City was allegedly called ``ISIS'' as a group of boys punched her and tried to remove her hijab; and on Thanksgiving day a Muslim cabdriver from Pittsburgh was shot in the back by a passenger who reportedly asked the driver about ISIS and whether he was a ``Pakistani guy.'' Just this weekend a man in California was arrested and charged for a hate crime and arson after allegedly setting a fire in a mosque. Last week Representative Andre Carson--a Democrat from Indiana and one of the two American Muslims who serve in the U.S. Congress-- received a death threat. Here is what Congressman Carson said: You have other politicians who are joining the bandwagon and who are fanning the flames of bigotry. That concerns me because we're putting people into the line of fire exposing them to death threats, discrimination at the workplace and assaults. These incidents of intimidation, hostility, and violence impact the entire Muslim American community. They also play into our enemies' warped views of the United States. Director Comey of the FBI noted last week that ``the notion that the U.S. is anti-Muslim is part of ISIL's narrative and Al Qaeda's narrative.'' It is important to note that not only Muslim Americans are being targeted. Bigots have also targeted Arab Americans, many of whom are Christian, and Hindus, and Sikhs. After 9/11, the first victim killed in the backlash was Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh American, in Mesa, AZ. I submitted a resolution, which passed the Senate unanimously, condemning bigotry against Sikh Americans. In 2012, a White supremacist murdered six Sikhs at a gurdwara in Oak Creek, WI. Following this terrorist attack, I chaired a hearing on hate crimes and the threat of domestic extremism where we learned that the FBI wasn't even tracking these crimes against Arab Americans, Hindu Americans, and Sikh Americans. I asked the FBI to change the policy, and they did. Clearly there is more work to be done. Last week, a vandal spray-painted anti-Muslim graffiti on a Sikh gurdwara in Buena Park, CA. In September, a Sikh man in my home State of Illinois suffered a fractured cheekbone after he was allegedly assaulted by a man who yelled ``terrorist'' and ``go back to your country'' at him. As we work to combat terrorism, we must also work to prevent and punish discrimination and hate-fueled violence against Muslim Americans. The rights of Muslim Americans are just as important as the rights of Christians, Jews, followers of other faiths, and nonbelievers as well. We know the First Amendment protects both the free exercise of religion and the freedom of speech. But all of us, especially those of us in public life, have a responsibility to choose our words carefully. We must condemn bias and bigotry aimed at Muslim Americans and make it clear that we will not tolerate religious discrimination in the United States of America. We can protect our Nation and still be true to the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold that suggestion? Mr. DURBIN. Yes. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8625-S8626] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FREEDOM OF RELIGION Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is interesting--the Midwest draws us together in the right way. Last night in Springfield, IL, a typical midwestern American city, there was a gathering of people from all across the city at 5:30 on a Sunday night. It was a gathering at the Islamic Society of Springfield. A request had been made for people of all religions to come together and to pray in solidarity with our Islamic neighbors. It was billed as a peace rally originally scheduled to be held outside, even in winter weather. Although it has been warm for this time of year, it was raining heavy last night as we all arrived at the building, so everyone crammed inside the building. There was standing and sitting room only. It was a huge outpouring of support for our Muslim brothers and sisters in the Springfield community. There were representatives of virtually every religion present, and many spoke--rabbis, ministers, Catholic nuns, and even a few elected officials--trying to let our friends in the Muslim community know that despite some of the things that had been said over the last few weeks by Presidential candidates, we in fact embrace them as part of the American family. There was also an event this weekend that occurred far away from Springfield, in Scottsdale, AZ, where my colleague in the Senate, Jeff Flake of Arizona, visited a mosque. It was widely reported. He made outstanding remarks about the regret he felt over some of the political statements that had been made over the last several weeks by political candidates. Jeff Flake reminded us across the Nation, as I tried to remind those in Springfield last night, that America is a nation which values the freedom of religious belief. Our Constitution speaks to only three elements when it comes to religion and our government. First, it says that each of us has the freedom and liberty to choose our own religion or to choose no religion. Second, it says our government will never establish an official state religion. Third, in article VI, it says there will be no religious test in the United States of America of candidates for public office. It is hard to believe that those three simple thoughts have carried this Nation for more than two centuries when it comes to religion, but we have been successful. Our Nation has been successful where others have failed. There have been times when we failed to live up to our own ideals and our own values, and when hateful statements are made by Presidential candidates, it calls on us to remember our history and to remember triumphant moments and sad moments as well. It was May of 1939 when the ship SS St. Louis left Germany with 900 Jewish passengers. They were trying to escape Hitler and the Nazis. They went to Havana, Cuba, and they were turned away. Then they came to Miami, FL, asking if they could be refugees, Jewish refugees, coming to the United States, and they were turned away as well. The 900 Jewish passengers went back to Germany. According to the records of the Holocaust Museum, 200 of them perished in the Holocaust. It was about that same time when Senator Robert Wagner of New York offered a measure in the Senate--in this very Chamber--that our country would accept 10,000 Jewish children from Germany who were seeking to escape the Holocaust. Sadly, that measure was defeated. We have other instances in history that go back to the beginning of our Nation where we have been challenged to live up to the ideals and principles of the Constitution. That challenge is with us again today. A candidate for President of the United States--of a major political party--has called for the exclusion of Muslims from being allowed to immigrate into the United States. That is reprehensible, it is outrageous, and it is un-American. Members of both political parties in Congress have spoken out against it, as they should. We must remember that many of our Nation's Founders fled religious persecution to come to this Nation. George Washington summed up the prevailing view when he said, ``In this land of equal liberty, it is our boast, that a man's religious tenets will not forfeit the protection of the laws.'' That, of course, is included in the First Amendment to our Constitution. Throughout our history, many religious minorities have faced intolerance, often prejudice. It was once Catholics from Ireland, Italy, and my mother's homeland of Lithuania who were questioned. Today American Muslims face the same threats of similar discrimination. In recent weeks a number of prominent Republican leaders have made these threats. But I add quickly that there has been a greater number, thank goodness, who have spoken out against these statements, even on the Republican side. One Presidential candidate compared Syrian refugees to ``rabid dogs'' and said that American Muslims should not be President of the United States. The frontrunner for the Republican nomination called for a ``total and complete'' ban on Muslim immigrants coming to the United States and advocated for closing down their places of worship. These comments are reprehensible and do not reflect who we are as a nation. These comments also don't reflect the vital role that millions of Muslim Americans play in my hometown of Springfield, IL, and across the United States. There are American Muslims who are teachers, professors, doctors, police officers, first responders, and members of the U.S. Armed Forces. I am concerned that the anti-Muslim rhetoric we have heard in recent weeks could alienate the Muslim community and harm the important relationship between the community and Federal law enforcement. Last night, as I was leaving the gathering in Springfield, a mother pulled me aside and said she feared for her daughter who wears a hijab--a veil--and who may be the subject of discrimination because of the things that have been said by some of these Presidential candidates. It is important for us to understand her feelings, the love of her children, just as we love our own children and grandchildren, and to also realize that the feelings of the Muslim Americans are truly part of our Nation. Last night we began the gathering in Springfield, IL, pledging allegiance to the flag--all of us--and singing ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Then the first person to make remarks in the Muslim community told us he had served in the U.S. Navy for 19 years. It is hard to imagine some of the hateful things that have been said in that context. In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2004--not long after 9/11--FBI Director Robert Mueller thanked the Muslim and Arab American communities ``for their assistance and for their ongoing commitment to preventing acts of terrorism.'' It has been important to the United States. He went on to say: ``All of us understand that the evolving threats we face today, and those we will face tomorrow, can only be defeated if we work together.'' The current FBI Director, James Comey, spoke before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week and said: We've worked so hard over the last 15 years to build relationships of trust that allow us to find out who might be trouble and to stop it. That's in everybody's interest. And anything that gets in the way, that erodes that relationship of trust, is not a good thing. The inflammatory speeches we have heard create a fertile ground for discrimination. Attorney General Loretta Lynch recently denounced the ``disturbing rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric'' and stated that her ``greatest fear as a prosecutor . . . is that the rhetoric will be accompanied by acts of violence.'' Sitting next to me last night in Springfield was the U.S. attorney for the Central District of Illinois, James Lewis--a friend and someone I am very honored and proud to have nominated to the President for this position. He [[Page S8626]] told me he spent the last several weeks traveling across Central Illinois, visiting Muslim mosques and assuring them that they were still part of America and that they had the full protection of the law.

Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to speak about the loss of one of the bravest men in the Chicago Fire Department, Daniel Capuano. Daniel went to work this morning--just as he has done every day for the past 15 years--ready to fight fires and risk his life to save the lives of others. Not many people can say they wake up each day ready to make that sacrifice, but this morning, Daniel Capuano did just that. At 2:40 a.m. today, Daniel Capuano and his fellow firefighters were contacted about a warehouse fire in the 9200 block of South Baltimore Avenue on the South Side of Chicago. Daniel and the other firefighters were immediately dispatched to the scene. The warehouse was undergoing construction, and because of that, there were reports of holes in the floors. When they got there, they saw billowing smoke coming out of the vacant three-story warehouse. Firefighter Capuano and his team moved cautiously through the second floor of the warehouse in search of the cause of the fire, but the heavy, thick smoke made it nearly impossible to see, causing Capuano to fall through an elevator shaft from the second floor of the building to the basement. His fellow firefighters were able to find him quickly and get him on an ambulance and to a nearby hospital. Sadly, it was too late. By the time he arrived at the hospital, he was already in serious condition. At 4:25 a.m. this morning, Daniel Capuano was pronounced dead from trauma. It is times like these when we are reminded of just how dangerous the job these men and women face every day really is. Daniel Capuano spent his entire career putting the safety of his community before his own. For 15 years he served the Chicago Fire Department fighting and eliminating fires while pulling others to safety. Before that, he was a firefighter in Evergreen Park, a Chicago suburb. Daniel Capuano is a true hero who made the ultimate sacrifice to make the residents of his community and neighborhood safe. Daniel's death is a devastating loss and serves as a reminder of the risk our firefighters and [[Page S8625]] other first responders take every day. My condolences and prayers are with his wife Julie; his three children, Nicholas, Andrew, and Amanda; and his fellow firefighters. Daniel, you are a hero to me and to the people of Chicago and Illinois. There are no words to truly describe the sorrow for your loss. I cannot, nor can anyone, thank you for the commitment you made for the safety of the people in your community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8624-S8625] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING DANIEL CAPUANO Mr. DURBIN.

CREC-2015-12-14-pt1-PgS8626-4,CREC-2015-12-14,114,Starzak Nomination (Executive Session),"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8626-S8629] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Starzak Nomination Mr. REED. Mr. President, these are all able and capable individuals who have been nominated and approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee. I want to pay particular attention to the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be general counsel of the Department of the Army. I have had the pleasure of working with Ms. Starzak for several years in her current capacity as the deputy general counsel of the Department of Defense. She has done an extraordinary job. I am confident that her extensive legal experience in her current--as well as previous-- position has prepared her well for the position for which she has been nominated. Prior to her current position at the Department of Defense, Ms. Starzak worked at the CIA's Office of General Counsel and also served as counsel on the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. I don't need to [[Page S8627]] tell my colleagues in the Senate how much we rely on capable and motivated staff to fulfill our responsibilities on behalf of the American people. I understand from Senator Feinstein, under whose chairmanship Ms. Starzak served, that her work in support of the committee was nothing short of exemplary. She was an extraordinary asset to the committee in all of its deliberations. Ms. Starzak was originally nominated to be general counsel of the Army in July 2014, and she was later approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee by a voice vote in December 2014. Unfortunately, Ms. Starzak was not confirmed by the full Senate prior to the adjournment of the last session of the Congress. She was renominated in January of this year and her nomination was unanimously agreed to by a voice vote of the committee earlier this month. The Army has now been without a Senate-confirmed general counsel for nearly 2 years, thereby contributing to institutional instability and uncertainty. It is time to provide the Army with the leadership it deserves. If confirmed today, Ms. Starzak will join a new Secretary of the Army and also a new Army Chief of Staff, GEN Mark Milley, where together they will begin to address the challenges--all of them critical--that face the Army and all of our services. I have no doubt that Ms. Starzak is up to the task and will execute her duties with the best interest of the men and women in uniform in the U.S. Army and their families. These thoughts will always be in the forefront of her mind, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination. I wish also to point out that there were several issues raised with respect to Ms. Starzak's performance as a member of the staff of the Intelligence Committee. All of them have been found to be inaccurate. One suggestion is that there was a document known as the Panetta review, and that the committee staff gained inappropriate access to this document. Senator Feinstein pointed out--at the time she was the chairman of the Intelligence Committee--during a March 2014 floor speech that this Panetta review and all of these documents were accessed by staff through the regular use of a search tool provided by the CIA on a computer network provided by the CIA to search documents provided by the CIA. This was a process that was overseen and monitored by the CIA, obviously. This specific suggestion, allegation, or whatever you want to call it, has been reviewed by the CIA's Inspector General, the Senate's Sergeant at Arms, the CIA's Accountability Review Board, and they found no wrongdoing on the part of members on the Intelligence Committee staff. There was another suggestion that some of these documents were marked deliberative and/or privileged. According to Senator Feinstein, this was not especially noteworthy to SSCI--Intelligence Committee staff-- because they were providing, at the direction of their Senators, a review of CIA activities, and thousands of these documents were marked deliberative, procedural, privileged, et cetera. The responsibility of the Congress is to oversee the CIA--not what they will let us look at but what we must look at. Additionally, Senate legal counsel confirmed to Senator Feinstein that Congress does not recognize these claims of privilege when it comes to documents provided to Congress for its oversight duties, and this review process was completely within the purview of the Senate's oversight responsibility. And then there was another suggestion, or allegation, that, in fact, Ms. Starzak was involved in the relocation of these Panetta review documents from an offsite CIA facility to the offices of the Senate Intelligence Committee here in the Hart Building. These are absolutely and totally without merit because it turns out that the date of the removal of the documents from the offsite facility occurred late in 2013, more than 2 years after Ms. Starzak left the staff of the Intelligence Committee. I think it is important to get these facts and conclusions by authoritative sources, such as the Sergeant at Arms, the CIA Inspector General, and the Accountability Review Board of the CIA because there have been some suggestions that she was, in fact, culpable, and that is not the case at all. I again urge all of my colleagues to support a very capable individual who has the skill, the dedication, and the ability to be an extraordinary general counsel for Department of the Army. With that, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally. Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally. We have already divided the time equally. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. REED. How much time do we have remaining on our side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes. Mr. REED. I believe Senator Feinstein is coming to the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally charged to both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am very pleased to rise in strong support of the confirmation of Alissa Starzak to be the general counsel of the Army. I urge my colleagues to support her nomination in the vote we are about to take. Alissa was nominated for the position in July of 2014. While she was reported out favorably by the distinguished Armed Services Committee last year, she did not receive consideration by the full Senate prior to the end of the 113th Congress. The President nominated her again in January of this year, and I am very pleased that the Armed Services Committee, under the chairmanship of John McCain and the ranking member, Jack Reed, approved her nomination just a week ago, and I thank both of them for doing so. I support Alissa Starzak for the only reason that matters: She will be an excellent general counsel for the Department of the Army. First, she is a strong lawyer. Second, she cares deeply about the men and women of the U.S. Army. Given the many challenges our military faces, we can't afford to have this position remain vacant when there is a very strong candidate before us. Since mid-2011, Alissa Starzak has been a senior attorney within the Office of General Counsel of the Department of Defense. She currently serves as a deputy general counsel. She has led the Department's interactions with Congress on preparing and negotiating the annual Defense authorization, and she has had senior roles in policy discussions about detainee affairs, sexual assault, and harassment in the military. Alissa has strong expertise in the legal challenges that confront the U.S. Army, and she is well suited to provide legal guidance to the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army and ensure the Department strictly obeys the law. More importantly for me, Alissa was a counsel on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from early 2007 to 2011, first under Chairman Jay Rockefeller and then continuing under my chairmanship. In that role, she worked diligently on legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, culminating in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, and she drafted our Intelligence authorization bills, among other issues. From December 2007 until her departure from the committee in 2011, Alissa was one of two staff leads for our review of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. She coauthored a [[Page S8628]] summary of interrogations of two early CIA detainees, Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri, that spurred the committee to approve, by a 14-to-1 vote, a full review of the entire program. As the colead of that study, Ms. Starzak reviewed many thousands of documents, drafted portions of the committee's study, and advised me and other members of the committee on the progress of the investigation. She departed the committee in 2011--that was 4 years ago--before the completion of the report, its declassification, and its public release. I know her work on the SSCI study came up during her confirmation hearing at the Armed Services Committee, and I want the record to be perfectly clear. Alissa Starzak departed the committee staff in May of 2011, well before the controversy of the CIA gaining unauthorized access to the committee staff computer network and well before the controversy over the so-called Panetta Review documents. So it is not fair to blame her for anything that happened during that time. She was not there and has not been there for 4 years. As I stated in a Senate floor statement on March 11, 2014, a portion of the CIA's Panetta Review was transported securely, consistent with its classification from a CIA off-site location to another secure facility--the committee's safe in the Senate. This relocation occurred in late 2013, more than 2 years after Ms. Starzak left the committee staff and long after she began her work at the Pentagon. She had no prior knowledge and no role in the transportation of the document to the Senate. So there should be no confusion on that point. Before coming to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Alissa Starzak worked as an attorney at the CIA's Office of General Counsel and as an associate in the international law firm of O'Melveny & Myers. She clerked for the Honorable E. Grady Jolly on the Fifth Circuit of Appeals after graduating from the University of Chicago Law School with honors. Ms. Starzak did her undergraduate work at Amherst College where she graduated magna cum laude. So Alissa Starzak has the intelligence, the right background, and the strong experience within the Department of Defense to be general counsel for the Army. I urge my colleagues to confirm Alissa Starzak. It is unfortunate that it has taken a year and a half since she was first nominated, but I am very pleased we are voting to confirm her today. I conclude by thanking Senator McCain and Senator Reed for working together to get this done. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, since no one else seeks the floor at this time, it has just been brought to my attention that there are a couple of letters here which I thought are on point, and it will become clear. This letter is from Alberto Mora: I want to state my absolute and explicit endorsement for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army. By my current affiliation with the Harvard Kennedy School's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, I served as the General Counsel of the Navy from 2001-2006. I have served alongside many of the most senior civilians in the Department of Defense, and I know what qualities successful civilian leaders should bring to their work, among them professional competence and a commitment to honorable public service. These two qualities describe Ms. Starzak. The Senate has honored me four times by confirming me for appointments in both Republican and Democratic administrations. I am familiar with and supportive of the Senate's role in confirming senior federal officials, but I fear that in Ms. Starzak's case her confirmation has been impeded for reasons unworthy of the Senate. As you are no doubt aware, she served as counsel on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for more than four years. Her work on that committee was thorough and professional; she has served the Congress and our republic ably. That she has been disparaged for her work is wrong. It sends a clear and troubling signal to every congressional staffer of both parties that his or her dedicated public service may be treated not as a credential, but as a disqualification for senior administration appointments. If that signal is confirmed by failing to confirm Ms. Starzak--not for what she did wrong, but for what she did right--it would only serve to damage the Senate, this and future administrations, and our nation. It is signed by Alberto Mora. I would also like to submit a letter from RADM John D. Hutson, U.S. Navy, head of the JAG Corps, retired. I write to express my complete and unequivocal support for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army. I have deep concerns that her nomination has been the subject of unfortunate and nasty political theater, but I am heartened to know that her nomination will receive a full floor vote on Monday, 14 December 2015. As you are no doubt aware, she served as a professional staff member on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for more than four years. . . . I served as The Judge Advocate General of the Navy. I underwent the confirmation process. As the senior uniformed lawyer in our service, I spent significant time assisting nominees with confirmation. Throughout my career I worked alongside, and under, some of the most capable, professional, and brilliant people who make up the civilian ranks of appointed leaders in our government. While I don't know her personally, I am very familiar with her reputation, which is stellar. I write because I believe her case has been one that has damaged our republic. She has been maligned for performing her duties as a public servant, and her nomination was held up because of events that occurred after she left the committee staff. I encourage you in the strongest terms to confirm her for this position. Losing her services to the rankling of partisan disputes would be to the detriment of both the Department of Defense and the country. Sincerely, John D. Hutson, Rear Admiral, USN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: McLean, VA, December 11, 2015. Dear Senator: I write to state my absolute and explicit endorsement for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army.

Her work on that committee was thorough and professional; she has served the Congress and our republic ably. That she has been disparaged for her work is wrong. It sends a clear and troubling signal to every congressional staffer of both parties that his or her dedicated public service may be treated not as a credential, but as a disqualification for senior administration appointments. If that signal is confirmed by failing to confirm Ms. Starzak--not for what she did wrong, but for what she did right--it would only serve to damage the Senate, this and future administrations, and our nation. I encourage you to confirm Ms. Starzak without further delay. Sincerely, Alberto Mora. ____ December 11, 2015. Dear Senator: I write to express my complete and unequivocal support for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army. I have deep concerns that her nomination has been the subject of unfortunate and nasty political theater, but I am heartened to know that her nomination will receive a full floor vote on Monday, 14 December 2015. As you are no doubt aware, she served as a professional staff member on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for more than four years. Unfortunately, she has been unfairly and inappropriately used as ``leverage'' in a partisan quarrel. I served as The Judge Advocate General of the Navy. I underwent the confirmation process. As the senior uniformed lawyer in our service, I spent significant time assisting nominees with confirmation. Throughout my career I worked alongside, and under, some of the most capable, professional, and brilliant people who make up the civilian ranks of appointed leaders in our government. While I don't know her personally, I am very familiar with her reputation, which is stellar. [[Page S8629]] I write because I believe her case has been one that has damaged our republic. She has been maligned for performing her duties as a public servant, and her nomination was held up because of events that occurred after she left the committee staff. I encourage you in the strongest terms to confirm her for this position. Losing her services to the rankling of partisan disputes would be to the detriment of both the Department of Defense and the country. Sincerely, John D. Hutson, Rear Admiral, USN, JACG, (Ret.).

Vote Explanation Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, unfortunately, due to inclement weather that delayed my flight to Washington, DC, I was unable to attend today's rollcall vote on the nomination of Alissa M. Starzak to be General Counsel of the Department of the Army. Had I been able to attend, I would have supported her nomination.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8626-S8629] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Starzak Nomination Mr. REED. Mr. President, these are all able and capable individuals who have been nominated and approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee. I want to pay particular attention to the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be general counsel of the Department of the Army. I have had the pleasure of working with Ms. Starzak for several years in her current capacity as the deputy general counsel of the Department of Defense. She has done an extraordinary job. I am confident that her extensive legal experience in her current--as well as previous-- position has prepared her well for the position for which she has been nominated. Prior to her current position at the Department of Defense, Ms. Starzak worked at the CIA's Office of General Counsel and also served as counsel on the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. I don't need to [[Page S8627]] tell my colleagues in the Senate how much we rely on capable and motivated staff to fulfill our responsibilities on behalf of the American people. I understand from Senator Feinstein, under whose chairmanship Ms. Starzak served, that her work in support of the committee was nothing short of exemplary. She was an extraordinary asset to the committee in all of its deliberations. Ms. Starzak was originally nominated to be general counsel of the Army in July 2014, and she was later approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee by a voice vote in December 2014. Unfortunately, Ms. Starzak was not confirmed by the full Senate prior to the adjournment of the last session of the Congress. She was renominated in January of this year and her nomination was unanimously agreed to by a voice vote of the committee earlier this month. The Army has now been without a Senate-confirmed general counsel for nearly 2 years, thereby contributing to institutional instability and uncertainty. It is time to provide the Army with the leadership it deserves. If confirmed today, Ms. Starzak will join a new Secretary of the Army and also a new Army Chief of Staff, GEN Mark Milley, where together they will begin to address the challenges--all of them critical--that face the Army and all of our services. I have no doubt that Ms. Starzak is up to the task and will execute her duties with the best interest of the men and women in uniform in the U.S. Army and their families. These thoughts will always be in the forefront of her mind, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination. I wish also to point out that there were several issues raised with respect to Ms. Starzak's performance as a member of the staff of the Intelligence Committee. All of them have been found to be inaccurate. One suggestion is that there was a document known as the Panetta review, and that the committee staff gained inappropriate access to this document. Senator Feinstein pointed out--at the time she was the chairman of the Intelligence Committee--during a March 2014 floor speech that this Panetta review and all of these documents were accessed by staff through the regular use of a search tool provided by the CIA on a computer network provided by the CIA to search documents provided by the CIA. This was a process that was overseen and monitored by the CIA, obviously. This specific suggestion, allegation, or whatever you want to call it, has been reviewed by the CIA's Inspector General, the Senate's Sergeant at Arms, the CIA's Accountability Review Board, and they found no wrongdoing on the part of members on the Intelligence Committee staff. There was another suggestion that some of these documents were marked deliberative and/or privileged. According to Senator Feinstein, this was not especially noteworthy to SSCI--Intelligence Committee staff-- because they were providing, at the direction of their Senators, a review of CIA activities, and thousands of these documents were marked deliberative, procedural, privileged, et cetera. The responsibility of the Congress is to oversee the CIA--not what they will let us look at but what we must look at. Additionally, Senate legal counsel confirmed to Senator Feinstein that Congress does not recognize these claims of privilege when it comes to documents provided to Congress for its oversight duties, and this review process was completely within the purview of the Senate's oversight responsibility. And then there was another suggestion, or allegation, that, in fact, Ms. Starzak was involved in the relocation of these Panetta review documents from an offsite CIA facility to the offices of the Senate Intelligence Committee here in the Hart Building. These are absolutely and totally without merit because it turns out that the date of the removal of the documents from the offsite facility occurred late in 2013, more than 2 years after Ms. Starzak left the staff of the Intelligence Committee. I think it is important to get these facts and conclusions by authoritative sources, such as the Sergeant at Arms, the CIA Inspector General, and the Accountability Review Board of the CIA because there have been some suggestions that she was, in fact, culpable, and that is not the case at all. I again urge all of my colleagues to support a very capable individual who has the skill, the dedication, and the ability to be an extraordinary general counsel for Department of the Army. With that, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally. Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally. We have already divided the time equally. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Mr. REED. How much time do we have remaining on our side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes. Mr. REED. I believe Senator Feinstein is coming to the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally charged to both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am very pleased to rise in strong support of the confirmation of Alissa Starzak to be the general counsel of the Army. I urge my colleagues to support her nomination in the vote we are about to take. Alissa was nominated for the position in July of 2014. While she was reported out favorably by the distinguished Armed Services Committee last year, she did not receive consideration by the full Senate prior to the end of the 113th Congress. The President nominated her again in January of this year, and I am very pleased that the Armed Services Committee, under the chairmanship of John McCain and the ranking member, Jack Reed, approved her nomination just a week ago, and I thank both of them for doing so. I support Alissa Starzak for the only reason that matters: She will be an excellent general counsel for the Department of the Army. First, she is a strong lawyer. Second, she cares deeply about the men and women of the U.S. Army. Given the many challenges our military faces, we can't afford to have this position remain vacant when there is a very strong candidate before us. Since mid-2011, Alissa Starzak has been a senior attorney within the Office of General Counsel of the Department of Defense. She currently serves as a deputy general counsel. She has led the Department's interactions with Congress on preparing and negotiating the annual Defense authorization, and she has had senior roles in policy discussions about detainee affairs, sexual assault, and harassment in the military. Alissa has strong expertise in the legal challenges that confront the U.S. Army, and she is well suited to provide legal guidance to the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army and ensure the Department strictly obeys the law. More importantly for me, Alissa was a counsel on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from early 2007 to 2011, first under Chairman Jay Rockefeller and then continuing under my chairmanship. In that role, she worked diligently on legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, culminating in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, and she drafted our Intelligence authorization bills, among other issues. From December 2007 until her departure from the committee in 2011, Alissa was one of two staff leads for our review of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. She coauthored a [[Page S8628]] summary of interrogations of two early CIA detainees, Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri, that spurred the committee to approve, by a 14-to-1 vote, a full review of the entire program. As the colead of that study, Ms. Starzak reviewed many thousands of documents, drafted portions of the committee's study, and advised me and other members of the committee on the progress of the investigation. She departed the committee in 2011--that was 4 years ago--before the completion of the report, its declassification, and its public release. I know her work on the SSCI study came up during her confirmation hearing at the Armed Services Committee, and I want the record to be perfectly clear. Alissa Starzak departed the committee staff in May of 2011, well before the controversy of the CIA gaining unauthorized access to the committee staff computer network and well before the controversy over the so-called Panetta Review documents. So it is not fair to blame her for anything that happened during that time. She was not there and has not been there for 4 years. As I stated in a Senate floor statement on March 11, 2014, a portion of the CIA's Panetta Review was transported securely, consistent with its classification from a CIA off-site location to another secure facility--the committee's safe in the Senate. This relocation occurred in late 2013, more than 2 years after Ms. Starzak left the committee staff and long after she began her work at the Pentagon. She had no prior knowledge and no role in the transportation of the document to the Senate. So there should be no confusion on that point. Before coming to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Alissa Starzak worked as an attorney at the CIA's Office of General Counsel and as an associate in the international law firm of O'Melveny & Myers. She clerked for the Honorable E. Grady Jolly on the Fifth Circuit of Appeals after graduating from the University of Chicago Law School with honors. Ms. Starzak did her undergraduate work at Amherst College where she graduated magna cum laude. So Alissa Starzak has the intelligence, the right background, and the strong experience within the Department of Defense to be general counsel for the Army. I urge my colleagues to confirm Alissa Starzak. It is unfortunate that it has taken a year and a half since she was first nominated, but I am very pleased we are voting to confirm her today. I conclude by thanking Senator McCain and Senator Reed for working together to get this done. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, since no one else seeks the floor at this time, it has just been brought to my attention that there are a couple of letters here which I thought are on point, and it will become clear. This letter is from Alberto Mora: I want to state my absolute and explicit endorsement for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army. By my current affiliation with the Harvard Kennedy School's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, I served as the General Counsel of the Navy from 2001-2006. I have served alongside many of the most senior civilians in the Department of Defense, and I know what qualities successful civilian leaders should bring to their work, among them professional competence and a commitment to honorable public service. These two qualities describe Ms. Starzak. The Senate has honored me four times by confirming me for appointments in both Republican and Democratic administrations. I am familiar with and supportive of the Senate's role in confirming senior federal officials, but I fear that in Ms. Starzak's case her confirmation has been impeded for reasons unworthy of the Senate. As you are no doubt aware, she served as counsel on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for more than four years. Her work on that committee was thorough and professional; she has served the Congress and our republic ably. That she has been disparaged for her work is wrong. It sends a clear and troubling signal to every congressional staffer of both parties that his or her dedicated public service may be treated not as a credential, but as a disqualification for senior administration appointments. If that signal is confirmed by failing to confirm Ms. Starzak--not for what she did wrong, but for what she did right--it would only serve to damage the Senate, this and future administrations, and our nation. It is signed by Alberto Mora. I would also like to submit a letter from RADM John D. Hutson, U.S. Navy, head of the JAG Corps, retired. I write to express my complete and unequivocal support for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army. I have deep concerns that her nomination has been the subject of unfortunate and nasty political theater, but I am heartened to know that her nomination will receive a full floor vote on Monday, 14 December 2015.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: McLean, VA, December 11, 2015.

More importantly for me, Alissa was a counsel on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from early 2007 to 2011, first under Chairman Jay Rockefeller and then continuing under my chairmanship. In that role, she worked diligently on legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, culminating in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, and she drafted our Intelligence authorization bills, among other issues. From December 2007 until her departure from the committee in 2011, Alissa was one of two staff leads for our review of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. She coauthored a [[Page S8628]] summary of interrogations of two early CIA detainees, Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri, that spurred the committee to approve, by a 14-to-1 vote, a full review of the entire program. As the colead of that study, Ms. Starzak reviewed many thousands of documents, drafted portions of the committee's study, and advised me and other members of the committee on the progress of the investigation. She departed the committee in 2011--that was 4 years ago--before the completion of the report, its declassification, and its public release. I know her work on the SSCI study came up during her confirmation hearing at the Armed Services Committee, and I want the record to be perfectly clear. Alissa Starzak departed the committee staff in May of 2011, well before the controversy of the CIA gaining unauthorized access to the committee staff computer network and well before the controversy over the so-called Panetta Review documents. So it is not fair to blame her for anything that happened during that time. She was not there and has not been there for 4 years. As I stated in a Senate floor statement on March 11, 2014, a portion of the CIA's Panetta Review was transported securely, consistent with its classification from a CIA off-site location to another secure facility--the committee's safe in the Senate. This relocation occurred in late 2013, more than 2 years after Ms. Starzak left the committee staff and long after she began her work at the Pentagon. She had no prior knowledge and no role in the transportation of the document to the Senate. So there should be no confusion on that point. Before coming to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Alissa Starzak worked as an attorney at the CIA's Office of General Counsel and as an associate in the international law firm of O'Melveny & Myers. She clerked for the Honorable E. Grady Jolly on the Fifth Circuit of Appeals after graduating from the University of Chicago Law School with honors. Ms. Starzak did her undergraduate work at Amherst College where she graduated magna cum laude. So Alissa Starzak has the intelligence, the right background, and the strong experience within the Department of Defense to be general counsel for the Army. I urge my colleagues to confirm Alissa Starzak. It is unfortunate that it has taken a year and a half since she was first nominated, but I am very pleased we are voting to confirm her today. I conclude by thanking Senator McCain and Senator Reed for working together to get this done. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, since no one else seeks the floor at this time, it has just been brought to my attention that there are a couple of letters here which I thought are on point, and it will become clear. This letter is from Alberto Mora: I want to state my absolute and explicit endorsement for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army. By my current affiliation with the Harvard Kennedy School's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, I served as the General Counsel of the Navy from 2001-2006. I have served alongside many of the most senior civilians in the Department of Defense, and I know what qualities successful civilian leaders should bring to their work, among them professional competence and a commitment to honorable public service. These two qualities describe Ms. Starzak. The Senate has honored me four times by confirming me for appointments in both Republican and Democratic administrations. I am familiar with and supportive of the Senate's role in confirming senior federal officials, but I fear that in Ms. Starzak's case her confirmation has been impeded for reasons unworthy of the Senate. As you are no doubt aware, she served as counsel on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for more than four years. Her work on that committee was thorough and professional; she has served the Congress and our republic ably. That she has been disparaged for her work is wrong. It sends a clear and troubling signal to every congressional staffer of both parties that his or her dedicated public service may be treated not as a credential, but as a disqualification for senior administration appointments. If that signal is confirmed by failing to confirm Ms. Starzak--not for what she did wrong, but for what she did right--it would only serve to damage the Senate, this and future administrations, and our nation. It is signed by Alberto Mora. I would also like to submit a letter from RADM John D. Hutson, U.S. Navy, head of the JAG Corps, retired. I write to express my complete and unequivocal support for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army. I have deep concerns that her nomination has been the subject of unfortunate and nasty political theater, but I am heartened to know that her nomination will receive a full floor vote on Monday, 14 December 2015. As you are no doubt aware, she served as a professional staff member on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for more than four years. . . . I served as The Judge Advocate General of the Navy. I underwent the confirmation process. As the senior uniformed lawyer in our service, I spent significant time assisting nominees with confirmation. Throughout my career I worked alongside, and under, some of the most capable, professional, and brilliant people who make up the civilian ranks of appointed leaders in our government. While I don't know her personally, I am very familiar with her reputation, which is stellar. I write because I believe her case has been one that has damaged our republic. She has been maligned for performing her duties as a public servant, and her nomination was held up because of events that occurred after she left the committee staff. I encourage you in the strongest terms to confirm her for this position. Losing her services to the rankling of partisan disputes would be to the detriment of both the Department of Defense and the country. Sincerely, John D. Hutson, Rear Admiral, USN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: McLean, VA, December 11, 2015. Dear Senator: I write to state my absolute and explicit endorsement for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army.

Dear Senator: I write to express my complete and unequivocal support for the nomination of Alissa Starzak to be the next General Counsel of the Army. I have deep concerns that her nomination has been the subject of unfortunate and nasty political theater, but I am heartened to know that her nomination will receive a full floor vote on Monday, 14 December 2015.

Vote Explanation Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, unfortunately, due to inclement weather that delayed my flight to Washington, DC, I was unable to attend today's rollcall vote on the nomination of Alissa M. Starzak to be General Counsel of the Department of the Army. Had I been able to attend, I would have supported her nomination.",package_114_32.csv,22181,22181,22252,"[congressional record volume 161, number 181 (monday, december 14, 2015)] [senate] [pages s8626-s8629] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] starzak nomination mr. reed. mr. president, these are all able and capable individuals who have been nominated and approved by the senate armed services committee. i want to pay particular attention to the nomination of alissa starzak to be general counsel of the department of the army. i have had the pleasure of working with ms. starzak for several years in her current capacity as the deputy general counsel of the department of defense. she has done an extraordinary job. i am confident that her extensive legal experience in her current--as well as previous-- position has prepared her well for the position for which she has been nominated. prior to her current position at the department of defense, ms. starzak worked at the cia's office of general counsel and also served as counsel on the staff of the senate select committee on intelligence. i don't need to [[page s8627]] tell my colleagues in the senate how much we rely on capable and motivated staff to fulfill our responsibilities on behalf of the american people. i understand from senator feinstein, under whose chairmanship ms. starzak served, that her work in support of the committee was nothing short of exemplary. she was an extraordinary asset to the committee in all of its deliberations. ms. starzak was originally nominated to be general counsel of the army in july 2014, and she was later approved by the senate armed services committee by a voice vote in december 2014. unfortunately, ms. starzak was not confirmed by the full senate prior to the adjournment of the last session of the congress. she was renominated in january of this year and her nomination was unanimously agreed to by a voice vote of the committee earlier this month. the army has now been without a senate-confirmed general counsel for nearly 2 years, thereby contributing to institutional instability and uncertainty. it is time to provide the army with the leadership it deserves. if confirmed today, ms. starzak will join a new secretary of the army and also a new army chief of staff, gen mark milley, where together they will begin to address the challenges--all of them critical--that face the army and all of our services. i have no doubt that ms. starzak is up to the task and will execute her duties with the best interest of the men and women in uniform in the u.s. army and their families. these thoughts will always be in the forefront of her mind, and i urge my colleagues to support her nomination. i wish also to point out that there were several issues raised with respect to ms. starzak's performance as a member of the staff of the intelligence committee. all of them have been found to be inaccurate. one suggestion is that there was a document known as the panetta review, and that the committee staff gained inappropriate access to this document. senator feinstein pointed out--at the time she was the chairman of the intelligence committee--during a march 2014 floor speech that this panetta review and all of these documents were accessed by staff through the regular use of a search tool provided by the cia on a computer network provided by the cia to search documents provided by the cia. this was a process that was overseen and monitored by the cia, obviously. this specific suggestion, allegation, or whatever you want to call it, has been reviewed by the cia's inspector general, the senate's sergeant at arms, the cia's accountability review board, and they found no wrongdoing on the part of members on the intelligence committee staff. there was another suggestion that some of these documents were marked deliberative and/or privileged. according to senator feinstein, this was not especially noteworthy to ssci--intelligence committee staff-- because they were providing, at the direction of their senators, a review of cia activities, and thousands of these documents were marked deliberative, procedural, privileged, et cetera. the responsibility of the congress is to oversee the cia--not what they will let us look at but what we must look at. additionally, senate legal counsel confirmed to senator feinstein that congress does not recognize these claims of privilege when it comes to documents provided to congress for its oversight duties, and this review process was completely within the purview of the senate's oversight responsibility. and then there was another suggestion, or allegation, that, in fact, ms. starzak was involved in the relocation of these panetta review documents from an offsite cia facility to the offices of the senate intelligence committee here in the hart building. these are absolutely and totally without merit because it turns out that the date of the removal of the documents from the offsite facility occurred late in 2013, more than 2 years after ms. starzak left the staff of the intelligence committee. i think it is important to get these facts and conclusions by authoritative sources, such as the sergeant at arms, the cia inspector general, and the accountability review board of the cia because there have been some suggestions that she was, in fact, culpable, and that is not the case at all. i again urge all of my colleagues to support a very capable individual who has the skill, the dedication, and the ability to be an extraordinary general counsel for department of the army. with that, i retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor. the presiding officer. if no one yields time, the time will be charged equally. mr. reed. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally. we have already divided the time equally. the presiding officer. the senator is correct. mr. reed. how much time do we have remaining on our side? the presiding officer. eight and a half minutes. mr. reed. i believe senator feinstein is coming to the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. reed. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. reed. i ask unanimous consent that the time be equally charged to both sides. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. reed. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mrs. feinstein. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mrs. feinstein. madam president, i am very pleased to rise in strong support of the confirmation of alissa starzak to be the general counsel of the army. i urge my colleagues to support her nomination in the vote we are about to take. alissa was nominated for the position in july of 2014. while she was reported out favorably by the distinguished armed services committee last year, she did not receive consideration by the full senate prior to the end of the 113th congress. the president nominated her again in january of this year, and i am very pleased that the armed services committee, under the chairmanship of john mccain and the ranking member, jack reed, approved her nomination just a week ago, and i thank both of them for doing so. i support alissa starzak for the only reason that matters: she will be an excellent general counsel for the department of the army. first, she is a strong lawyer. second, she cares deeply about the men and women of the u.s. army. given the many challenges our military faces, we can't afford to have this position remain vacant when there is a very strong candidate before us. since mid-2011, alissa starzak has been a senior attorney within the office of general counsel of the department of defense. she currently serves as a deputy general counsel. she has led the department's interactions with congress on preparing and negotiating the annual defense authorization, and she has had senior roles in policy discussions about detainee affairs, sexual assault, and harassment in the military. alissa has strong expertise in the legal challenges that confront the u.s. army, and she is well suited to provide legal guidance to the secretary and chief of staff of the army and ensure the department strictly obeys the law. more importantly for me, alissa was a counsel on the senate select committee on intelligence from early 2007 to 2011, first under chairman jay rockefeller and then continuing under my chairmanship. in that role, she worked diligently on legislation to update the foreign intelligence surveillance act, culminating in the fisa amendments act of 2008, and she drafted our intelligence authorization bills, among other issues. from december 2007 until her departure from the committee in 2011, alissa was one of two staff leads for our review of the cia's detention and interrogation program. she coauthored a [[page s8628]] summary of interrogations of two early cia detainees, abu zubaydah and al-nashiri, that spurred the committee to approve, by a 14-to-1 vote, a full review of the entire program. as the colead of that study, ms. starzak reviewed many thousands of documents, drafted portions of the committee's study, and advised me and other members of the committee on the progress of the investigation. she departed the committee in 2011--that was

began her work at the pentagon. she had no prior knowledge and no role in the transportation of the document to the senate. so there should be no confusion on that point. before coming to the senate select committee on intelligence, alissa starzak worked as an attorney at the cia's office of general counsel and as an associate in the international law firm of o'melveny & myers. she clerked for the honorable e. grady jolly on the fifth circuit of appeals after graduating from the university of chicago law school with honors. ms. starzak did her undergraduate work at amherst college where she graduated magna cum laude. so alissa starzak has the intelligence, the right background, and the strong experience within the department of defense to be general counsel for the army. i urge my colleagues to confirm alissa starzak. it is unfortunate that it has taken a year and a half since she was first nominated, but i am very pleased we are voting to confirm her today. i conclude by

commitment to honorable public service. these two qualities describe ms. starzak. the senate has honored me four times by confirming me for appointments in both republican and democratic administrations. i am familiar with and supportive of the senate's role in confirming senior federal officials, but i fear that in ms. starzak's case her confirmation has been impeded for reasons unworthy of the senate. as you are no doubt aware, she served as counsel on the senate select committee on intelligence for more than four years. her work on that committee was thorough and

also like to submit a letter from radm john d. hutson, u.s. navy, head of the jag corps, retired. i write to express my complete and unequivocal support for the nomination of alissa starzak to be the

a full floor vote on monday, 14 december 2015. as you are no doubt aware, she served as a professional staff member on the senate select committee on intelligence for more than four years. . . . i

CREC-2015-12-14-pt1-PgS8629-6,CREC-2015-12-14,114,TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY ADJUTANT GENERAL EDWARD W. TONINI,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8629-S8630] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY ADJUTANT GENERAL EDWARD W. TONINI Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute today to a distinguished airman and honored Kentuckian who has given over four decades of his life to military service. Maj. Gen. Edward W. Tonini, for 8 years the adjutant general of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, retired from service on December 8. General Tonini is a career Air National Guard officer and was appointed adjutant general by the former Governor in 2007. As adjutant general, he served as the commanding general of both the Kentucky Army and Air National Guard and as executive director of the Department of Military Affairs. In his 8 years of service in that role, he successfully led the National Guard and Kentucky through many difficult challenges with great skill and ability. He leaves Kentucky's National Guard stronger and more effective than when he found it. During his tenure, Kentucky's National Guard continued to deploy soldiers and airmen to Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Djibouti, Kenya, Ethiopia, South America, and even Antarctica. In fact, Kentucky National Guard soldiers and airmen were deployed in support of contingency operations every day of General Tonini's tenure, to the tune of over 16,000 servicemembers over the years. In January 2009, Kentucky experienced one of the worst natural disasters in the State's history when 10 inches of snow fell on top of 3 inches of ice throughout most of the State. More than 100 counties declared states of emergency while FEMA declared the whole State a disaster zone. In response to this crisis, General Tonini led the largest State- active-duty call up in Kentucky's history. More than 4,600 servicemembers assisted Kentuckians in need, as nearly 800,000 people were without power and heat. Surely many lives were saved thanks to his leadership during these efforts. General Tonini worked to establish Kentucky's new, state-of-the-art Commonwealth Emergency Operations Center, which serves as a vital command center and liaison to local governments in times of crisis. The new Commonwealth Emergency Operations Center [[Page S8630]] isn't the only new improvement under General Tonini's watch. During the last 8 years, the Kentucky National Guard has undertaken nearly $200 million in facility improvements, consisting of both new buildings and additions and alterations to existing buildings, to add about 650,000 square feet of facilities to the Guard's resources. These new facilities include the Paducah and Richmond Armed Forces Reserve Center, the Owensboro Readiness Center, and the Army Aviation Support Facility in Frankfort, among others. General Tonini was also a champion of the important work taking place at the Bluegrass Station industrial park in central Kentucky. General Tonini was a strong advocate of Kentucky's Agribusiness Development Teams, a program in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. These teams of Kentucky soldiers and airmen taught agricultural expertise to the people of Afghanistan, sharing their knowledge of irrigation techniques, food preservation, veterinary medicine, and more with hundreds of Afghans across the country. General Tonini also was a strong supporter of the Guard's state partnership program, where the Kentucky National Guard partners with a foreign nation to strengthen the operations of both partners. The Kentucky National Guard has partnered with Ecuador for 19 years. Under the general's leadership, Kentucky added a second partnership program with Djibouti, making my State the first to partner with an east African nation. Djibouti is a key strategic partner for us in humanitarian and counterterrorist operations. General Tonini's leadership has also been recognized outside the Commonwealth. In 2013, he was elected the president of the Adjutants General Association of the United States. During his tenure as president, America's National Guard boasted more than 450,000 personnel across the Nation. Under General Tonini, Kentucky hosted the two largest events in the Nation for survivor outreach to support the family members of fallen servicemembers, one in Louisville and the other in northern Kentucky. We were able to honor more than 850 survivors from multiple States. Finally, the Kentucky National Guard Memorial saw completion after 10 years thanks to General Tonini's persistence and his prodigious fundraising efforts. Located at Boone National Guard Center in Frankfort, the memorial honors 234 Kentucky guardsmen who have given their lives in the line of duty since 1912. General Tonini has all these accomplishments and many more to be proud of as he steps down from the adjutant general post he so ably filled for 8 years. He has truly earned a place not just in Kentucky history, but in Kentuckians' hearts for his honorable service. I would be remiss if I did not also laud the general's wife, Carol, who has been a consistent presence with him at the full range of National Guard events, both in Kentucky and throughout the country. She has been a tremendous asset to him thanks to her grace, her support for those in uniform and their families, and her rock-solid support for her husband. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating General Edward W. Tonini upon his retirement and thanking him for his service--not just over the last 8 years, but over the last four decades. Kentucky is thankful for the many sacrifices he has made over the years to protect our communities and our Nation. I certainly want to wish General Tonini all the best in whatever awaits him in his next endeavors, and I am sure he will tackle all future challenges with the same vigor and fortitude he applied to his military service. Thank you, General Tonini, on behalf of a grateful Commonwealth. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8629-S8630] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY ADJUTANT GENERAL EDWARD W.

Mr. President, I want other Senators to be aware of information I received about Ecuadorian National Assembly member Lourdes Tiban, a prominent and respected leader of Ecuador's indigenous people. As an indigenous leader, Ms. Tiban has become one of the most outspoken advocates for freedom of expression, indigenous rights, and social rights in Ecuador. Not surprisingly, this has made her the target of verbal attacks by President Rafael Correa. Earlier this year, Ms. Tiban was beaten by unidentified assailants as she was walking to work. The assault was filmed and then shared online by government supporters who posted humiliating comments. This isn't the first time that Ms. Tiban has been physically assaulted. She is the victim of two other similar incidents which I am told have not been properly investigated. It is regrettable that, instead of vigorously investigating this latest attack against Ms. Tiban, a National Assembly member from President Correa's political party has brought a criminal case for libel against her. This is believed to be in retaliation for Ms. Tiban's claim that government supporters were responsible for targeting her, presumably in an attempt to silence her and remove her from the National Assembly. Ecuador is a country where judicial independence is seriously compromised. I have spoken about this several times, and it has been well documented by the Department of State, the United Nations, and human rights organizations. It is also illustrated by the fact that the Council of the Judiciary, with the power to appoint and remove judges, is comprised of five former officials of the Correa administration. It is likely that the criminal investigation against Ms. Tiban could result in an unjust conviction. We should condemn these attacks on freedom of expression, political rights, and the rights of indigenous people, and we should defend judicial independence which is fundamental to democracy in Ecuador and throughout the hemisphere. Lourdes Tiban has devoted her legislative efforts to protecting human rights for her people, and I am confident that she will continue to do so as she is not easily intimidated. She has my support and the support of others who believe in the principles of democracy.

CREC-2015-12-14-pt1-PgS8630,CREC-2015-12-14,114,RECOGNIZING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CULINARY WORKERS UNION LOCAL 226,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8630] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CULINARY WORKERS UNION LOCAL 226 Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 80th anniversary of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226. Since it was founded in 1935, the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 has successfully advocated on behalf of thousands of hospitality workers throughout Nevada. These workers include the housekeepers, kitchen staff, cooks, and food and beverage servers who play an indispensable role in our local and national economy. Along with local partners, the culinary union has effectively represented workers by advocating for competitive wages, affordable health insurance coverage, and enhanced working conditions. The culinary union is vital in the effort to provide real opportunities for working-class individuals and families. Over the past eight decades, workplace environments across the United States have been transformed to meet our country's changing needs. Throughout these changes, the culinary union has always been on the frontlines to ensure that workers continue to receive fair treatment and the benefits they have earned. In particular, the culinary union successfully mobilized casino workers on many occasions to ensure that they received adequate health care coverage, improved contract terms, and pension benefits. The organization has also had a positive impact on its members through the establishment of local services, such as the culinary health fund and the culinary pharmacy. The culinary health fund is a health plan that provides benefits to more than 130,000 participants, ensuring that union members and their families have access to essential health care services that keep them healthy. Additionally, in 2001, the culinary union launched a citizen project, which provides assistance for individuals and families navigating the citizenship process. I applaud the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 for their dedicated work and commitment to improving the lives of Nevadans. Their work is truly appreciated and admired, and I wish the organization continued success for years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8630] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CULINARY WORKERS UNION LOCAL 226 Mr. REID.

CREC-2015-12-14-pt1-PgS8631,CREC-2015-12-14,114,RECOGNIZING THE GRAND ISLE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8631] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE GRAND ISLE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many talented Vermonters support local agencies charged with ensuring the safety of Vermont communities throughout the State, each and every day. Today I would like to recognize one such department--the Grand Isle County Sheriff's Department, which received two national Highway Safety Awards at last month's annual gathering of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Chicago. Grand Isle County lies in the northwest reaches of Vermont, covering five towns and 85 square miles of land. It is actually a chain of islands surrounded by the waters of Lake Champlain, with commanding views of the Adirondacks to the west and the Green Mountains to the east. Its communities swell with summer visitors who come to enjoy the ``beauty spot'' of the islands. While it is a rural area, Grand Isle County is also home to the busy Route 2 corridor that links the United States and Canada, a critical transportation route for commerce between the two countries. As such, Grand Isle provides unique challenges for Sheriff Ray Allen and his 13 sworn deputies who work to protect the safety of its visitors and residents while ensuring that traffic is not impeded. The Grand Isle Sheriff's Department was one of only three small sheriff agencies to be recognized with the National Law Enforcement Safety Challenge award, as noted by the Burlington Free Press. The award cited the department's excellence in traffic safety, with specific focus on impaired driving and speeding violations. Sheriff Allen's department was also honored with the National Sheriffs' Association's Top Traffic Safety Award, sharing that distinction with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office. These two awards are a notable achievement for a small department and in no small part due to Sheriff Allen's strong leadership. Sheriff Allen is the type of law enforcement officer who cares deeply about the communities he serves and the department he represents. Sheriff Allen was sworn into office in 2011, following 20 years of service as a deputy sheriff. When he is not tending to highways, he is tending to the family's well-known apple orchard. On the Grand Isle Sheriff's Department Web site, Sheriff Allen cites ``the great working relationship with Local, State and Federal agencies'' that his department enjoys. This, we know, does not happen by accident, and such cooperation is a trademark of successful policing. ``We will strive to build upon the confidence and trust the citizens of Grand Isle County have placed upon us by developing strong relationships with the community and providing high quality, cost effective law enforcement services.'' This is Sheriff Allen's pledge, and one supported by those who work with him. With these awards, Sheriff Allen has done just that. He has made his department and his community proud. Congratulations, Sheriff Ray Allen. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8631] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE GRAND ISLE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT Mr. LEAHY.

CREC-2015-12-14-pt1-PgS8631-2,CREC-2015-12-14,114,TRIBUTE TO PRISCILLA HOBSON HANLEY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8631] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PRISCILLA HOBSON HANLEY Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the contributions of Priscilla Hobson Hanley, who is retiring after more than 30 years of distinguished public service as staff in the U.S. Congress. Since the very beginning of my service in the Senate nearly 19 years ago, Priscilla has been one of my most valued advisers. She has always provided me with expertise on health care issues and Social Security, and most recently, she has served as staff director for the Senate Aging Committee. She exemplifies the ideal public servant; integrity, thoroughness, a spirit of inquiry, and hard work characterize her service. Above all, Priscilla has always demonstrated her belief that it is an honor to serve the people of Maine and our Nation. I first met Priscilla in 1984 when we both worked for Maine Senator Bill Cohen. After brief stints working in the House for two Congressmen from her native California, Priscilla was hired by Senator Cohen that year and developed an in-depth knowledge of health care issues. She became deputy staff director of the Aging Committee when Senator Cohen served as chairman. When I assumed Senator Cohen's seat in 1997, Priscilla was one of the very first people I hired; thus I had a terrific expert in two subject areas of great concern to my Maine constituents: health care and senior issues. As health policy adviser and legislative assistant, Priscilla brought her intelligence and experience to bear on the complex and myriad issues of health care, biomedical research, access to care in rural areas, women's health, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Through her leadership role on the Aging Committee staff, she advanced our priorities of improving retirement security, increasing funding for research on diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes, and protecting against scams targeting seniors. Three examples illustrate Priscilla's commitment to service. In 1997, my very first year in the Senate, we were considering a massive tax bill. At the last minute, a one-sentence provision appeared out of nowhere that was, beneath the innocuous wording, a $50-billion tax giveaway to Big Tobacco. Priscilla spotted that one sentence in the 327-page bill, and we were able to put an end to the subsidy. Priscilla also helped me start the Diabetes Caucus in the Senate in 1998. As a result of her dedication, funding for diabetes research has tripled since that year. In 2003, our Nation was still reeling from the attacks of 9/11, and Congress was working on a tax-cut bill to invigorate the struggling economy. A key to the success of that bill and to the economic rebound that followed was the temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, to help States provide health care to low-income families. Priscilla led the way in developing that key provision. From dramatic increases in funding for diabetes and Alzheimer's research to improvements in rural health care and advancements in mental health parity, Priscilla has played a leadership role. Her work, due to her unassuming nature, may often be unheralded, but her legacy is inspiring to all of us who serve. When not working for the American people, Priscilla's great passion is a love of musical theater. In fact, a rare interruption in her more than three decades of service on the Hill came when she took a brief respite from Congress to help run an opera company in Virginia. Priscilla has a particular fondness for the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, and like Major General Stanley of The Pirates of Penzance, she has an encyclopedic knowledge of all things ``vegetable, animal, and mineral.'' She truly is the very model of a modern Senate staffer, a model all should emulate. A life so devoted to public service brings to mind the parable of the talents. The master, leaving on a journey, entrusts a servant with a portion of his treasure. Upon his return, the master is delighted to find that his wealth was been wisely invested and multiplied. Priscilla Hobson Hanley was entrusted the great treasure of intelligence, energy, and passion. She invested that treasure wisely and through hard work and determination multiplied its benefits to all. To her, I quote Scripture and say, ``Well done, good and faithful servant.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8631] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PRISCILLA HOBSON HANLEY Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize one of West Virginia's prized public servants, Mark Felton, on the occasion of his retirement. Through his various roles in the Region III Planning and Development Council, Mark has been an indispensable resource to the four counties he has served for over 30 years. After earning his bachelor's and master's degrees in geography from Marshall University, Mark began his career in the transportation department of the regional planning council in 1983. Mark authored and supervised innumerable transportation-related studies that benefited residents of the region through improved roads, bridges, travel times, and safety. The regional councils serve as integral partners in the planning and execution of infrastructure improvements, including water and sewer projects. During my time representing the 2nd [[Page S8632]] Congressional District and continuing through to my time in the Senate, my staff and I worked with Mark and the council to complete numerous infrastructure projects; as a result, we provided potable water to thousands of West Virginians. I have always appreciated the technical assistance and knowledge that Mark and his staff bring to any undertaking. These projects are not always the most glamorous, but they are necessary for the health of the people we serve. In 2006, Mark was promoted to executive director of the regional planning council. In this role, Mark successfully worked alongside local, county, and State leaders to achieve many goals throughout the region. Mark was consistent in his determination to utilize region III's resources in the most efficient manner possible. One highlight of Mark's career includes working with the West Virginia Division of Highways and the U.S. Department of Transportation to build the Saint Albans--Nitro Bridge. This was a major achievement that required patience and diligent planning to complete. Through a clever design variation, millions of taxpayer dollars were saved, and the project was completed ahead of schedule. I commend Mark and his team for working skillfully with Federal and State partners to accomplish this huge undertaking under budget and on time. Time and again, Mark exhibited great leadership and wisdom in his roles with the regional planning council and has made a lasting difference in the health and safety of residents of Kanawha, Clay, Boone, and Putnam Counties. In his spare time, Mark actively participates in local theater activities in the Kanawha Valley, acting in roles for the Charleston Light Opera Guild and Kanawha Players. In addition, he previously served as president of the Children's Theater of Charleston. Hopefully he will continue with his passion, as I have always enjoyed seeing him on stage. Mark is also a member of Kanawha United Presbyterian Church where he actively participates in the church and bell choirs. Additionally, he is a property trustee of the church and plans to be more involved in both internal operations and outreach ministries after his retirement. Mark and his wife, Kerry, a kindergarten teacher for Kanawha County Schools, have two children, Erin and Patrick. I wish Mark a fond farewell and the best of luck to him and his family in the next phase of their lives. Our State owes Mark a debt of gratitude for his hard work and dedication to his community. It has been a privilege working with him, and I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mark on a wonderful career. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S8631-S8632] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MARK FELTON Mrs. CAPITO.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Nashua Mayor Donnalee Lozeau. As a resident of Nashua, I am so proud to call Donnalee my mayor. She is an extraordinary public servant, and I extend my heartfelt gratitude as she approaches the conclusion of her two terms serving the people of the Gate City. As a third generation resident of Nashua and a graduate of the city's public school system, Donnalee cares deeply about Nashua's future, and she has a long record of service to the people of our city. That includes her previous service to Nashua in the New Hampshire House of Representatives for eight terms, earning the role of deputy speaker. She has always been known for her independent leadership, her commitment to bringing people together to build consensus, and for ensuring that government is responsive and efficient on behalf of hard- working taxpayers. Donnalee grasps the qualities of what makes our State unique, and in turn, she leads with a passion for problem-solving and a dedication to delivering results. She truly listens to everyone and communicates in sincere and candid terms--which I believe makes her an exceptional leader. In addition, as Nashua's first female mayor, Donnalee is an inspiration for young women in our State to pursue public service. Under her leadership, Nashua's growth and resilience as a city helped lead to major accomplishments in infrastructure, public education, new business sectors, and companies. Donnalee brought her welcoming, honest, and accessible approach to governing and enhanced the reputation of the city of Nashua by exemplifying those values. In addition to her tireless work at city hall, she has also been an active leader promoting philanthropic, cultural, and business activity across the city. As part of her ongoing dedication to serving Nashua's community and those in need, Donnalee will continue to contribute to our city as executive director of Southern New Hampshire Services, a nonprofit social services agency. Her legacy is also being honored by Nashua's Rivier University with the creation of the Mayor Donnalee Lozeau Leadership Scholarship, which will be used to support the development of many generations of new leaders to come. As Donnalee prepares to leave city hall, I would like to thank her for the thousands of hours she devoted to making Nashua an even better place to live, work, and raise a family. I am so grateful for Donnalee's leadership, commitment, and friendship, and I wish her all the best as she begins the next chapter of her career. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8632] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO MAYOR DONNALEE LOZEAU Ms. AYOTTE.

Robert E. ``Bob'' Wolverton Sr., former vice president for academic affairs and longtime professor of classics, will see his name etched into the rotunda of MSU's new classroom building, a 150,000 square foot structure currently under construction in the heart of the 137-year-old campus. The honor comes while the 90-year-old educator is still active as a member of the MSU faculty. Seeing more than 2,000 students walk each day through the facility's rotunda once construction is completed in the fall of 2016, this naming reflects Wolverton's dedication to educating students for 66 years, 38 of those at Mississippi State. ``Simply put, Dr. Wolverton is a venerable institution at our university,'' said MSU President Mark E. Keenum. ``At an age where most professors have long since retired, Dr. Wolverton continues to inspire his students, his colleagues, and this administration through his true wisdom and the passion he still has for the subject matter he imparts. What a fitting honor that the rotunda in one of our soon-to-be iconic buildings will forever bear his name.'' Wolverton began his tenure at MSU in 1977 when he became the university's vice president of academic affairs, having served previously as president for the College of Mount St. Joseph in Ohio. In 1986, he began teaching in the Department of Foreign Languages, now the Department of Classical and Modern Languages and Literatures, serving as the unit's head from 1991-1996. A two-term chair of MSU's Robert Holland Faculty Senate, he last held the title eight years ago at age 82, with many regarding him as the ``elder statesman'' in such a position at any college or university.

CREC-2015-12-14-pt1-PgS8633,CREC-2015-12-14,114,REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN J. NOLAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8633] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN J. NOLAN Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to honor a Nebraskan who was recently interred at Arlington National Cemetery. Lt. Col. John J. Nolan of Lincoln, NE, was a U.S. Air Force pilot who deserves our respect and gratitude. After the bombing at Pearl Harbor, he gave up a football scholarship at Temple University to enlist in the Army Air Corps in 1943. During World War II, John was a B-25 aircraft commander with the heralded Air Apaches, 345th Bombardment Group, assigned to the Fifth Air Force operating in the Southwest Pacific. In this capacity, he flew low-level strafing missions in specially configured B-25s with eight .50-caliber machine guns that were controlled by pilots. He flew in the Black Sunday raid on Hollandia, New Guinea, on April 16, 1944. This raid became the worst operational loss ever suffered by the Fifth Air Force in a single day. Following World War II, the Air Force realized more pilots had been lost on instruments than in actual combat. In response, the Instrument Pilot Instruction School was created. John was one of the initial cadre of pilots tasked with providing standardized instrument procedures, techniques, and training methods. These pilots were also required to test and evaluate flight instruments in adverse weather conditions. During this period, he became the B-25 high-time pilot for the entire U.S. Air Force. John also wrote a substantial part of the instrument flying guidelines, known as Air Force Manual 51-37. Many pilots owe their lives to this manual. As a matter of fact, when his two sons went through pilot training in 1967 and 1973, respectively, his instructions were still in the manual. John transitioned to F-86s as a part of the Air Force's newly created All Weather Interceptors. He also served in Japan during the Korean war. In the 1960s, when commercial aviation was converting to jet-powered aircraft and entering into military airspace at high altitudes, John was assigned to Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, known as Air Defense Command. He became the Air Force liaison to the FAA Central Region, and he was tasked with developing and coordinating procedures to ensure safe arrival and departures within this shared airspace. In this capacity, John was also responsible for maintaining military readiness and operational capabilities. Upon his retirement in October 1963, John was chosen to serve as the Midwest recruiter for the Air Force Academy. John dedicated his entire life to his beloved U.S. Air Force. Not only did he serve honorably, John was also an integral participant in so many of the milestones that are now a part of Air Force history. John never lost his love of flight. He continued to fly well into his late eighties in his restored Fairchild PT 19/26, which is the same aircraft he initially learned to fly in as a cadet in the Army Air Corps. Lt. Col. John Nolan's entire life was for God and country. He married Marie Di Giambattista on January 6, 1944, before he was assigned overseas. Together, they raised four children. Marie sacrificed much, as so many of our military families experience today, moving 23 times in John's 20-year career. They were married 71 years. Only 27 days after Marie passed, John died this past July 3, 2015, at the age of 94. We owe a debt of gratitude to John Nolan and his family. He led an extraordinary life at a time when our country needed people like him the most. Through all of this, he remained humble. We will never forget his sacrifices and patriotism. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8633] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN J.

Nolan of Lincoln, NE, was a U.S. Air Force pilot who deserves our respect and gratitude. After the bombing at Pearl Harbor, he gave up a football scholarship at Temple University to enlist in the Army Air Corps in 1943. During World War II, John was a B-25 aircraft commander with the heralded Air Apaches, 345th Bombardment Group, assigned to the Fifth Air Force operating in the Southwest Pacific. In this capacity, he flew low-level strafing missions in specially configured B-25s with eight .50-caliber machine guns that were controlled by pilots. He flew in the Black Sunday raid on Hollandia, New Guinea, on April 16, 1944. This raid became the worst operational loss ever suffered by the Fifth Air Force in a single day. Following World War II, the Air Force realized more pilots had been lost on instruments than in actual combat. In response, the Instrument Pilot Instruction School was created. John was one of the initial cadre of pilots tasked with providing standardized instrument procedures, techniques, and training methods. These pilots were also required to test and evaluate flight instruments in adverse weather conditions. During this period, he became the B-25 high-time pilot for the entire U.S. Air Force. John also wrote a substantial part of the instrument flying guidelines, known as Air Force Manual 51-37. Many pilots owe their lives to this manual. As a matter of fact, when his two sons went through pilot training in 1967 and 1973, respectively, his instructions were still in the manual.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the life and accomplishments of civil rights attorney Fred Gray, Sr., of Montgomery, AL. Fred Gray was born in Montgomery, AL, on December 14, 1930. He attended the Nashville Christian Institute and received a baccalaureate degree from the then-Alabama State College for Negroes. From there, he went on to receive a law degree from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, OH. Mr. Gray passed the bar examination and returned to his home town of Montgomery to establish a law office. He dedicated himself to the goal of ``destroying everything segregated he could find.'' He also began preaching at the Holt Street Church of Christ. During the 1950s and 1960s civil rights movement, Mr. Gray worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., E.D. Nixon, and other leaders of the movement. He represented Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks, who were charged with disorderly conduct for refusing to seat themselves in the rear of segregated city buses. Mr. Gray also successfully defended Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., against tax evasion charges. In addition, he represented the Montgomery Improvement Association during the more than yearlong Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955, which ultimately led to the United States Supreme Court case Browder v. Gayle. This case was filed by Mr. Gray. Additionally, Mr. Gray filed and argued the historic and much-cited case of Gomillion v. Lightfoot before the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned State redistricting of Tuskegee, AL. After this case, Mr. Gray continued to lead legal efforts to desegregate schools in Alabama. In 1970, Mr. Gray was one of the first African Americans elected as a State legislator in Alabama. However, he did not allow his new role to prevent him from continuing to represent local Alabamians in the judicial system. In the early 1970s, Mr. Gray represented plaintiffs in the class- action lawsuit regarding the Federal Tuskegee syphilis study and succeeded in securing appropriate damages and restitutions for 72 study survivors. As a result of efforts led by Mr. Gray, President Clinton invited the study survivors and their families to a ceremony at the White House, where he officially apologized for the actions of the Federal Government regarding the study. In 2002, Fred Gray became the first African-American president of the Alabama Bar Association. Mr. Gray has spent his life working to achieve equal justice and liberty for the citizens of Alabama. His dedication to the civil rights movement is unequaled, and we are all grateful for the tireless work he has done on behalf of all Americans. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 181 (Monday, December 14, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S8633] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO FRED GRAY Mr. SESSIONS.
