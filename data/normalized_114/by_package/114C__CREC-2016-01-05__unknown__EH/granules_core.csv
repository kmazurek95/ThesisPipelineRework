Conroy, offered the following prayer: Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another year. We give You thanks also for the first session of the 114th Congress, and Your sustaining us with Your presence, wisdom, patience, and love. We ask that the efforts of the first session might prove fruitful in the benefits redounding to our Nation and its people. We ask as well Your forgiveness for the smallness of actions on some occasions and the inability to work together when so many were adversely affected. We know that this is not what You wish for us, not what the American people wish for our Nation, and not what the Members of this people's House have been elected for. Lord, have mercy. We ask Your blessing now on each Member of Congress, that they might be their best selves in representing not only their constituents, but also the entire American citizenry. They have taken oaths to do so. Give them the strength and the wisdom to fulfill those oaths. We thank You as well for this marvelous forum, where the important business of this Nation has been done in the past and will be done in the upcoming second session. May the work to be done be inspired by the wisdom of prophets and the love of saintly people. May all that we do be done for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [House] [Page H3] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J.

Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today our Arkansas delegation rises to pay tribute to a dedicated public servant, an exceptional orator, and a distinguished son of Arkansas. Former Arkansas Governor and four-term United States Senator Dale Leon Bumpers passed away on Friday, January 1, at the age of 90. Hailing from the small town of Charleston, Arkansas, Senator Bumpers graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in political science and followed that with service in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. After earning his law degree from Northwestern University, Bumpers and his wife, Betty, returned to their hometown of Charleston, where he practiced law. In the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision on Brown v. Board of Education, Bumpers advised the Charleston School Board to immediately desegregate its school system. Listed as his proudest achievement, the Charleston School District was the first school district in the former Confederacy to desegregate. Nicknamed by The New York Times as the ``giant killer,'' Senator Bumpers emerged as a dark horse candidate to defeat long-time Governor Orval Faubus in 1970. In his two terms as Governor, he continued and expanded Governor Rockefeller's era of expansive governmental reform. In 1974, he defeated five-term U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright in the Democratic primary with 65 percent of the vote to win the Senate seat and serve for 24 years. When I was a young Senate staffer, it was a pleasure to work with Senator Bumpers and my Second District predecessor, Congressman Ed Bethune, on the completion of the landmark Arkansas Wilderness Act of 1984. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, January 10, Dale Bumpers will be laid to rest. Those of us in the delegation, as we prepare to make our final good- byes, would ask for a moment of silence to honor this Arkansas leader, public servant, and elder statesman. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [House] [Page H5] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR OF THE LATE SENATOR DALE BUMPERS (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

The President's executive actions will require more gun sellers to be licensed and to conduct background checks, narrowing the dangerous loopholes that allow guns to fall into the hands of criminals or the mentally ill. The new rules will also make it easier for us to hold irresponsible dealers accountable and to track guns that are lost or stolen. This is a critical step forward, but it is not enough.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Staff Sergeant Peter Taub, one of six victims of a suicide bombing attack in Afghanistan on December 21. Peter was a remarkable young man. He was raised in Wyncote, Montgomery County, which I am proud to represent. He served 8 honorable years in the Air Force, assigned to the Office of Special Investigations, and stationed at the Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. At just 30 years old, Peter was a devout father, husband, and son, an exemplary soldier and public servant, an American hero. I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends Peter left behind and my greatest thanks for his service to our Nation. He gave us all the ultimate sacrifice. My heart especially goes out to Peter's family: his 3-year-old daughter, Penelope; his wife, Christina, expecting another child; his mother, Arlene; his father, Joel; and his brother, Jonathan. No parent should be predeceased by a child, and no child should have to grow up without a parent. These tragic losses are a reminder of the gravity of our foreign policy decisions and military engagement overseas. We must never take these responsibilities lightly. We must never forget the sacrifice that Staff Sergeant Peter Taub and his family have made to protect our freedoms. May God bless Peter's family. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [House] [Page H5] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF STAFF SERGEANT PETER TAUB (Mr. BRENDAN F.

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, ISIS fighters hail from nations all over the world, including the United States. Americans who go to fight the jihadists overseas are able to freely travel back to the United States with their U.S. passports. These homegrown jihadists are not coming back home to open up coffee shops. They are coming home to harm Americans. We have to stop them by keeping them from coming back at all. That is why the United States House passed the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act, which I introduced. The legislation is simple: revoke or deny passports of Benedict Arnold Americans who have assisted designated foreign terrorist organizations. Not only will the bill help law enforcement locate these individuals, it will prevent them from entering the United States at all. While my bill languishes down the hall in the Senate, Congress did pass a law allowing for the revocation of passports for Americans who are delinquent on their taxes.

CREC-2016-01-05-pt1-PgH7-3,CREC-2016-01-05,114,"HARNEY COUNTY, OREGON","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7-H9] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HARNEY COUNTY, OREGON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleagues are aware of the situation in Harney County, Oregon, where a group of armed protesters have overtaken a Federal facility in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. This group is led largely by people who are not necessarily from Oregon, although they obviously have supporters from Oregon. They were originally there to protest the sentencing of Dwight and Steve Hammond. I know the Hammonds. I have known them for probably close to 20 years. They are longtime, responsible ranchers in Harney County. They have been sentenced to prison not once, but now twice. I will get into that in a moment. The point I want to make at the outset is for people in this Chamber to understand what drives people to do what is happening tonight in Harney County. I have had the great honor and privilege to represent Harney County for a number of years. I have seen the impact of Federal policies from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration. I have seen what happens when overzealous bureaucrats and agencies go beyond the law and clamp down on people. I have seen what courts have done. I have seen the time for Congress to act and then it has not. I want to put this area in perspective because I think it is really important to understand how big this region is. By size, my congressional district in Oregon is something like the seventh or eighth biggest in the Congress. If you overlaid it over the east coast, it would start in the Atlantic and end in Ohio. The county where this occupation is taking place--Harney County--is over 10,000 square miles. There are 7,000 souls inhabiting it. If my math is right, that is one person for every 1.4 miles. One person for every 1.4 miles. Just this one county is 10 times the size of Rhode Island. It is larger than the State of Maryland. And 72 percent of it is under the command and control of the Federal Government. It is the public's land. That is true. But what people don't understand is the culture, the lifestyle, of the great American West and how much these ranchers care about the environment, about the future, about their children, about America, and how much they believe in the Constitution. Now we see the extent they will go to in order to defend what they view as their constitutional rights. Now, I am not defending armed takeovers. I do not think that is appropriate. I think the time has come for those to consider that they have made their case in the public about what is happening in the West, and perhaps it is time for them to realize they have made their case and to go home. But I want to talk about what happened with the Hammonds. I want to put in perspective what happens almost every year in my district. That is these enormous wildfires. {time} 1930 The Miller Homestead Wildfire in 2012 burned 160,000 acres, mostly in this county, if not all; 250 square miles, a quarter of the size of the State of Rhode Island. That was just in 2012. The Barry Point Fire that year, in Lake County, next door, burned 93,000 acres. Last summer alone, we burned 799,974 acres across Oregon; that is both forest and high desert. In 2012, 3.4 million acres burned in Oregon. There was another fire in Malheur County. The Long Draw Fire, in 2012, burned 557,000 acres, five times the size of Rhode Island. So 93,000 acres, 557,000 acres, 160,000 acres, all burning. The Hammonds are in prison tonight for setting a backfire that they admit to, that burned 139 acres, and they will sit in prison, time served and time going forward, 5 years, under a law that I would argue was never intended to mete out that kind of punishment, and I will get to that in a moment. I have told you I worked with the Hammonds and many ranchers in Harney County. In the last years of the Clinton administration, despite their own agency's reviews and analysis, Bill Clinton threatened to create a giant monument on Steens Mountain. When Secretary Babbitt, the Interior Secretary at the time, came before the House Resources Committee, of which I was a member, I said: Mr. Secretary, your own resource advisory committees in the area just reported that [[Page H8]] there was no need for additional protection on Steens Mountain, and yet, you and the President are threatening to create this national monument. Why do you waste the time of the citizens to go through a process to determine if additional protections are needed and then ignore what they came up with? To Bruce Babbitt's credit, he agreed when I told him: I think you would be surprised about what the local ranchers and citizens of Harney County would be willing to do if you give them a chance. To his credit, he said: All right, I will give them that chance. And he did. We went to work on legislation. It took a full year. I worked with the Hammonds. I worked with Stacy Davies, I worked with all kinds of folks, put a staffer on it full-time, multiple staffs, and we worked with the environmental community and others. And we created the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act, model legislation, never been done before, because I said: We don't have to live by past laws, we write laws. So we wrote a new law to create a cooperative spirit of management in Harney County. The Hammonds were part of that discussion. We saved a running camp, Harlan Priority Runs. We protected inholder. We tried to do all the right things and create the kind of partnership and cooperation that the Federal Government and the citizens should have. Fast forward on that particular law. Not long after that became law, and it was heralded as this monumental law of great significance and new era in cooperation and spirit of cooperation, some of those involved on the other side and some of the agencies decided to reinterpret it. The first thing they tried to do is shut down this kids' running camp because they said: Well, too many, maybe more than 20, run down this canyon and back up, as they had for many, many years. They wanted to shut it down. So we had to fight them back and said: No, the law says historical standards. Then the bureaucrats, because we said: You should have your historical access to your private property, if you are up on Steens Mountain, you should maintain that access like you have always had it. Do you know what the bureaucrats said? They began to solicit from the inholders in this area: How many times did you go up there last year? You see, they wanted to put a noose around the neck of those who were inside. That was a total violation of what we intended, and we had to back them off. See, the bureaucracy wants to interpret the laws we write in ways they want, and in this case they were wrong, not once, but twice. Then, a couple of years ago, I learned that, despite the fact we created the first cow-free wilderness in the United States under this law, and said clearly in this law that it would be the responsibility of the government to put up fencing to keep the cows out, as part of the agreement, the Bureau of Land Management said: No, we are not going to follow that law. And they told the ranchers they had to build the fence. I networked with my Democrat colleague from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio, who was part of writing this law. I said: Peter, you remember that, right? He said: Yeah, I didn't like it, but that was the case. BLM still wouldn't listen. So we continued to push it and they argued back. Well, it turns out there had been a second rancher who brought this to my attention who they were telling had to do the same thing, build a fence, when the government was supposed to under the law I wrote. The arrogance of the agency was such that they said: We don't agree with you. Now, there aren't many times, Mr. Speaker, in this job when you can say I know what the intent of the law was, but in this case I could because I wrote the law, I knew the intent. Oh, that wasn't good enough. No, no, no. No, no, no. The arrogance of these agency people was such that we had to go to the archives and drag out the boxes from 2000, 1999-2000, when we wrote this law, from the hearings that had all the records for the hearings and the floor discussions to talk about the intent. And our retired Member, George Miller, actually we used some of his information where he said the government would provide the fencing. They were still reluctant to follow it. So I put language in the appropriations bill that restated the Federal law. Do you understand how frustrated I am at this? Can you imagine how the people on the ground feel? Can you imagine? If you are not there, you can't. If you are not there, you can't. You ridicule them. The Portland Oregonian is running a thing, what do you send? Meals for militia. Let's have fun with this. This is not a laughing matter from any consequence. Nobody is going to win out of this thing. This is a government that has gone too far for too long. Now, I am not condoning this takeover in any way. I want to make that clear. I don't think it is appropriate. There is a right to protest. I think they have gone too far. But I understand and hear their anger. Right now, this administration, secretly, but not so much, is threatening, in the next county over, that looks a lot like this one, Malheur County, to force a monument of 2.5 million acres, we believe. I think this is outrageous. It flies in the face of the people and the way of life and the public access. There is a company, Keen Shoes, that already has a big marketing campaign. This is about selling shoes, for God's sake. I call on the President, if he wants to help reduce the tension that is out there, to walk away from this. And if he doesn't want to walk away and say, no, we are not going to do that, to help us bring down this level of frustration and anger, then at least be honest, or his Secretary of the Interior needs to be honest with us and tell us they are going to do it. Either they are or they aren't. But all they are is being coy. That feeds into this. It feeds into the anger that I feel. It feeds into the anger out there. So the President should say: I am not going to do a national monument. I am not going to add more fuel on this fire in the West. We have fought other issues. More than half of my district is under Federal management, or lack thereof. They have come out with these proposals to close roads into the forests. They have ignored public input. They often claim to have all these open meetings and listen to the public, and then, in the case of Wallowa-Whitman, the forest supervisor who was eventually relieved because of this, I believe, completely ignored all the meetings, all the input, all the work of the counties and the local people, and said: Forget it, I am going my own direction. There were 900 people that turned out at the National Guard Armory where they had a public hearing, standing room only and beyond, furious. You see, how do you have faith in a government that doesn't ever listen to you? How do you have faith in a government that, when elected Representatives write a law, those charged with the responsibility of implementing it choose to go the other direction and not do so? That is what is breaking faith between the American people and their government, and that is what has to change. The other thing that has to change, the law under which the Hammonds were sentenced. Now, they probably did some things that weren't legal. I have given you the size of the acreages that burned naturally. I haven't gotten into the discussion about how these fires are often fought and how the Federal Government frequently will go on private land and set a fire without permission to backburn. That happens all the time. In fact, in the Barry Point Fire down in Lake County, they set fire on private timber land as a backburn while the owners of the property were putting out spot fires down in the canyon. I drove down there afterwards. They are darn lucky to have come out alive. There was nobody sentenced under the terrorism act there. Oh, heck no. It is the government. They weren't sentenced. Nobody was charged. Oh, it just happened. Now, fires are tough to fight. I have great respect for firefighters. There are always two sides on how these fires get fought. But I can tell you, a few years back in Harney County, because I went and held a meeting out there right as the fire was being put out, that the fire crews came in, went on private ground, lit a backfire on private ground, behind a fence line, that then burned out the farmer's fence, the rancher's fence, and burned all the way over and down into [[Page H9]] a canyon where there was a wetland, which would have been the natural break to stop the fire from the other side. You see, they never needed to burn that land. These things happen in the course of fighting fire. It doesn't mean they are right. But rare is it that somebody ends up 5 years in prison. Let me tell you what the senior judge said when he sentenced the Hammonds the first time, Judge Michael Hogan, senior Federal judge, highly respected in Oregon. He sentenced Dwight Hammond to 3 months and Steve to a year. There were different offenses here. He said: ``I am not going to apply the mandatory minimum because, to me, to do so, under the Eighth Amendment, would result in a sentence which is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offenses here.'' The Judge went on to say: ``And with regard to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, this sort of conduct would not have been conduct intended under the statute. ``When you ask, you know, what if you burn sagebrush in the suburbs of Los Angeles, and there are homes up the ravines, it might apply. Out in the wilderness here, I don't think that is what the Congress intended. ``In addition, it just would not meet any idea I have of justice proportionality. It would be a sentence which would shock the conscience, to me.'' Senior Judge Mike Hogan, when he did the original sentencing. But, you see, under this 1996 law under which they were charged and convicted, it turns out he had no judicial leeway. He could not mete out a sentence that was proportionate to what the crime was. So yesterday, Dwight and Steve went to prison again. Dwight will be 73 when he gets out. Steve will be about 50. Meanwhile, in Harney County, on the ranch, Susie will continue to try and survive; 6,000-acre ranch, she needs grazing permits to make this happen. It would be a cruel and unjust act, by the way, if access to those grazing permits that allow that ranch to work were not extended. What possible good could come out of bankrupting a grandmother that was trying to keep a ranch together, while the husband sits in prison, her son sits in prison? What possible good? They will serve their sentences. There is nothing, short of clemency that only the President can offer, that we can do. But we can change that law, and we should, so that nobody ever is locked in like that for a situation like this, where a senior judge, literally, on his final day on the bench, says this goes too far, it goes too far. They appealed that, by the way, and lost. But I believe that the judge was right. We have to listen to the people. We have to understand why events like this are taking place in our communities. They are taking place in cities. We have witnessed that, and we try and get our heads around it. There are more people from the cities, so there are more Members from the cities. There aren't many of us that represent these vast, wide- open, incredibly beautiful, harsh districts like the one I do. The people there love the land. It was the ranchers who came up with the concept of the cooperative management. It was the ranchers who loved Steens Mountain that know that for them to survive they have to take care of the range. {time} 1945 They are good people. Their sons and daughters, by a higher proportion, fight in our wars and die, and I have been to their funerals. So to my friends across eastern Oregon, I will always fight for you. But we have to understand there is a time and a way. Hopefully the country through this understands we have a real problem in America: how we manage our lands and how we are losing them. It is not like we haven't tried here, Mr. Speaker. Year after year we pass bipartisan legislation to provide more active management on our forests so we don't lose them all to fire, and we are losing them all to fire. We are losing firefighters' lives, homes, and watersheds-- great resources of the West. Teddy Roosevelt would role over in his grave. He created this wildlife refuge in 1908. There were some bad actors there in the 1980s, by the way. They were very aggressive running the refuge, basically threatening eminent domain and other things that took ranches. It was bad. That lasted for at least a decade or more. It has gotten better though. It is not perfect. There is a much better relationship, and the refuge and the ranchers work closer together. In fact, during this fire in 2012, the refuge actually opened itself up to the ranchers for hay and feed because theirs was burned out because of this big fire. So there was a better spirit there. But there are still these problems: the threat of waters of the U.S. shutting down stock ponds and irrigation canals and a way of life, the threat of fire every year that seems to not be battled right and just gets away, and no one is really held accountable; the continued restriction on the lives of the men and women who, for generations, have worked hard in a tough environment. It has just gone too far. It is hurtful. I hope people understand how serious this is felt and how heartfelt this is by those who pay their taxes and try and live by the law and do the right things and how oppressed they feel by the government that they elect and the government they certainly don't elect, and how much they will always defend the flag and the country, and their sons and daughters would go to war, some will not come back--and they have not from this area. There is a better solution here. The President needs to back off on the monument. The BLM needs to make sure Susie Hammond isn't pushed into bankruptcy and has her ranch taken by the government and added to those that have been. We need to be better at hearing people from all walks of life and all regions of our country and understanding this anger that is out there and what we can do to bring about correct change and peaceful resolution. It is not too late. We can do this. It is a great country. We have the processes to do it right. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7-H9] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HARNEY COUNTY, OREGON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleagues are aware of the situation in Harney County, Oregon, where a group of armed protesters have overtaken a Federal facility in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. This group is led largely by people who are not necessarily from Oregon, although they obviously have supporters from Oregon. They were originally there to protest the sentencing of Dwight and Steve Hammond. I know the Hammonds. I have known them for probably close to 20 years. They are longtime, responsible ranchers in Harney County. They have been sentenced to prison not once, but now twice. I will get into that in a moment. The point I want to make at the outset is for people in this Chamber to understand what drives people to do what is happening tonight in Harney County. I have had the great honor and privilege to represent Harney County for a number of years. I have seen the impact of Federal policies from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration. I have seen what happens when overzealous bureaucrats and agencies go beyond the law and clamp down on people. I have seen what courts have done. I have seen the time for Congress to act and then it has not. I want to put this area in perspective because I think it is really important to understand how big this region is. By size, my congressional district in Oregon is something like the seventh or eighth biggest in the Congress. If you overlaid it over the east coast, it would start in the Atlantic and end in Ohio. The county where this occupation is taking place--Harney County--is over 10,000 square miles. There are 7,000 souls inhabiting it. If my math is right, that is one person for every 1.4 miles. One person for every 1.4 miles. Just this one county is 10 times the size of Rhode Island. It is larger than the State of Maryland. And 72 percent of it is under the command and control of the Federal Government. It is the public's land. That is true. But what people don't understand is the culture, the lifestyle, of the great American West and how much these ranchers care about the environment, about the future, about their children, about America, and how much they believe in the Constitution. Now we see the extent they will go to in order to defend what they view as their constitutional rights. Now, I am not defending armed takeovers. I do not think that is appropriate. I think the time has come for those to consider that they have made their case in the public about what is happening in the West, and perhaps it is time for them to realize they have made their case and to go home. But I want to talk about what happened with the Hammonds. I want to put in perspective what happens almost every year in my district. That is these enormous wildfires. {time} 1930 The Miller Homestead Wildfire in 2012 burned 160,000 acres, mostly in this county, if not all; 250 square miles, a quarter of the size of the State of Rhode Island. That was just in 2012. The Barry Point Fire that year, in Lake County, next door, burned 93,000 acres. Last summer alone, we burned 799,974 acres across Oregon; that is both forest and high desert. In 2012, 3.4 million acres burned in Oregon. There was another fire in Malheur County. The Long Draw Fire, in 2012, burned 557,000 acres, five times the size of Rhode Island. So 93,000 acres, 557,000 acres, 160,000 acres, all burning. The Hammonds are in prison tonight for setting a backfire that they admit to, that burned 139 acres, and they will sit in prison, time served and time going forward, 5 years, under a law that I would argue was never intended to mete out that kind of punishment, and I will get to that in a moment. I have told you I worked with the Hammonds and many ranchers in Harney County. In the last years of the Clinton administration, despite their own agency's reviews and analysis, Bill Clinton threatened to create a giant monument on Steens Mountain. When Secretary Babbitt, the Interior Secretary at the time, came before the House Resources Committee, of which I was a member, I said: Mr. Secretary, your own resource advisory committees in the area just reported that [[Page H8]] there was no need for additional protection on Steens Mountain, and yet, you and the President are threatening to create this national monument. Why do you waste the time of the citizens to go through a process to determine if additional protections are needed and then ignore what they came up with? To Bruce Babbitt's credit, he agreed when I told him: I think you would be surprised about what the local ranchers and citizens of Harney County would be willing to do if you give them a chance. To his credit, he said: All right, I will give them that chance. And he did. We went to work on legislation. It took a full year. I worked with the Hammonds. I worked with Stacy Davies, I worked with all kinds of folks, put a staffer on it full-time, multiple staffs, and we worked with the environmental community and others. And we created the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act, model legislation, never been done before, because I said: We don't have to live by past laws, we write laws. So we wrote a new law to create a cooperative spirit of management in Harney County. The Hammonds were part of that discussion. We saved a running camp, Harlan Priority Runs. We protected inholder. We tried to do all the right things and create the kind of partnership and cooperation that the Federal Government and the citizens should have. Fast forward on that particular law. Not long after that became law, and it was heralded as this monumental law of great significance and new era in cooperation and spirit of cooperation, some of those involved on the other side and some of the agencies decided to reinterpret it. The first thing they tried to do is shut down this kids' running camp because they said: Well, too many, maybe more than 20, run down this canyon and back up, as they had for many, many years. They wanted to shut it down. So we had to fight them back and said: No, the law says historical standards. Then the bureaucrats, because we said: You should have your historical access to your private property, if you are up on Steens Mountain, you should maintain that access like you have always had it. Do you know what the bureaucrats said? They began to solicit from the inholders in this area: How many times did you go up there last year? You see, they wanted to put a noose around the neck of those who were inside. That was a total violation of what we intended, and we had to back them off. See, the bureaucracy wants to interpret the laws we write in ways they want, and in this case they were wrong, not once, but twice. Then, a couple of years ago, I learned that, despite the fact we created the first cow-free wilderness in the United States under this law, and said clearly in this law that it would be the responsibility of the government to put up fencing to keep the cows out, as part of the agreement, the Bureau of Land Management said: No, we are not going to follow that law. And they told the ranchers they had to build the fence. I networked with my Democrat colleague from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio, who was part of writing this law. I said: Peter, you remember that, right? He said: Yeah, I didn't like it, but that was the case. BLM still wouldn't listen. So we continued to push it and they argued back. Well, it turns out there had been a second rancher who brought this to my attention who they were telling had to do the same thing, build a fence, when the government was supposed to under the law I wrote. The arrogance of the agency was such that they said: We don't agree with you. Now, there aren't many times, Mr. Speaker, in this job when you can say I know what the intent of the law was, but in this case I could because I wrote the law, I knew the intent. Oh, that wasn't good enough. No, no, no. No, no, no. The arrogance of these agency people was such that we had to go to the archives and drag out the boxes from 2000, 1999-2000, when we wrote this law, from the hearings that had all the records for the hearings and the floor discussions to talk about the intent. And our retired Member, George Miller, actually we used some of his information where he said the government would provide the fencing. They were still reluctant to follow it. So I put language in the appropriations bill that restated the Federal law. Do you understand how frustrated I am at this? Can you imagine how the people on the ground feel? Can you imagine? If you are not there, you can't. If you are not there, you can't. You ridicule them. The Portland Oregonian is running a thing, what do you send? Meals for militia. Let's have fun with this. This is not a laughing matter from any consequence. Nobody is going to win out of this thing. This is a government that has gone too far for too long. Now, I am not condoning this takeover in any way. I want to make that clear. I don't think it is appropriate. There is a right to protest. I think they have gone too far. But I understand and hear their anger. Right now, this administration, secretly, but not so much, is threatening, in the next county over, that looks a lot like this one, Malheur County, to force a monument of 2.5 million acres, we believe. I think this is outrageous. It flies in the face of the people and the way of life and the public access. There is a company, Keen Shoes, that already has a big marketing campaign. This is about selling shoes, for God's sake. I call on the President, if he wants to help reduce the tension that is out there, to walk away from this. And if he doesn't want to walk away and say, no, we are not going to do that, to help us bring down this level of frustration and anger, then at least be honest, or his Secretary of the Interior needs to be honest with us and tell us they are going to do it. Either they are or they aren't. But all they are is being coy. That feeds into this. It feeds into the anger that I feel. It feeds into the anger out there. So the President should say: I am not going to do a national monument. I am not going to add more fuel on this fire in the West. We have fought other issues. More than half of my district is under Federal management, or lack thereof. They have come out with these proposals to close roads into the forests. They have ignored public input. They often claim to have all these open meetings and listen to the public, and then, in the case of Wallowa-Whitman, the forest supervisor who was eventually relieved because of this, I believe, completely ignored all the meetings, all the input, all the work of the counties and the local people, and said: Forget it, I am going my own direction. There were 900 people that turned out at the National Guard Armory where they had a public hearing, standing room only and beyond, furious. You see, how do you have faith in a government that doesn't ever listen to you? How do you have faith in a government that, when elected Representatives write a law, those charged with the responsibility of implementing it choose to go the other direction and not do so? That is what is breaking faith between the American people and their government, and that is what has to change. The other thing that has to change, the law under which the Hammonds were sentenced. Now, they probably did some things that weren't legal. I have given you the size of the acreages that burned naturally. I haven't gotten into the discussion about how these fires are often fought and how the Federal Government frequently will go on private land and set a fire without permission to backburn. That happens all the time. In fact, in the Barry Point Fire down in Lake County, they set fire on private timber land as a backburn while the owners of the property were putting out spot fires down in the canyon. I drove down there afterwards. They are darn lucky to have come out alive. There was nobody sentenced under the terrorism act there. Oh, heck no. It is the government. They weren't sentenced. Nobody was charged. Oh, it just happened. Now, fires are tough to fight. I have great respect for firefighters. There are always two sides on how these fires get fought. But I can tell you, a few years back in Harney County, because I went and held a meeting out there right as the fire was being put out, that the fire crews came in, went on private ground, lit a backfire on private ground, behind a fence line, that then burned out the farmer's fence, the rancher's fence, and burned all the way over and down into [[Page H9]] a canyon where there was a wetland, which would have been the natural break to stop the fire from the other side. You see, they never needed to burn that land. These things happen in the course of fighting fire. It doesn't mean they are right. But rare is it that somebody ends up 5 years in prison. Let me tell you what the senior judge said when he sentenced the Hammonds the first time, Judge Michael Hogan, senior Federal judge, highly respected in Oregon. He sentenced Dwight Hammond to 3 months and Steve to a year. There were different offenses here. He said: ``I am not going to apply the mandatory minimum because, to me, to do so, under the Eighth Amendment, would result in a sentence which is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offenses here.'' The Judge went on to say: ``And with regard to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, this sort of conduct would not have been conduct intended under the statute. ``When you ask, you know, what if you burn sagebrush in the suburbs of Los Angeles, and there are homes up the ravines, it might apply. Out in the wilderness here, I don't think that is what the Congress intended. ``In addition, it just would not meet any idea I have of justice proportionality. It would be a sentence which would shock the conscience, to me.'' Senior Judge Mike Hogan, when he did the original sentencing. But, you see, under this 1996 law under which they were charged and convicted, it turns out he had no judicial leeway. He could not mete out a sentence that was proportionate to what the crime was. So yesterday, Dwight and Steve went to prison again. Dwight will be 73 when he gets out. Steve will be about 50. Meanwhile, in Harney County, on the ranch, Susie will continue to try and survive; 6,000-acre ranch, she needs grazing permits to make this happen. It would be a cruel and unjust act, by the way, if access to those grazing permits that allow that ranch to work were not extended. What possible good could come out of bankrupting a grandmother that was trying to keep a ranch together, while the husband sits in prison, her son sits in prison? What possible good? They will serve their sentences. There is nothing, short of clemency that only the President can offer, that we can do. But we can change that law, and we should, so that nobody ever is locked in like that for a situation like this, where a senior judge, literally, on his final day on the bench, says this goes too far, it goes too far. They appealed that, by the way, and lost. But I believe that the judge was right. We have to listen to the people. We have to understand why events like this are taking place in our communities. They are taking place in cities. We have witnessed that, and we try and get our heads around it. There are more people from the cities, so there are more Members from the cities. There aren't many of us that represent these vast, wide- open, incredibly beautiful, harsh districts like the one I do. The people there love the land. It was the ranchers who came up with the concept of the cooperative management. It was the ranchers who loved Steens Mountain that know that for them to survive they have to take care of the range. {time} 1945 They are good people. Their sons and daughters, by a higher proportion, fight in our wars and die, and I have been to their funerals. So to my friends across eastern Oregon, I will always fight for you. But we have to understand there is a time and a way. Hopefully the country through this understands we have a real problem in America: how we manage our lands and how we are losing them. It is not like we haven't tried here, Mr. Speaker. Year after year we pass bipartisan legislation to provide more active management on our forests so we don't lose them all to fire, and we are losing them all to fire. We are losing firefighters' lives, homes, and watersheds-- great resources of the West. Teddy Roosevelt would role over in his grave. He created this wildlife refuge in 1908. There were some bad actors there in the 1980s, by the way. They were very aggressive running the refuge, basically threatening eminent domain and other things that took ranches. It was bad. That lasted for at least a decade or more. It has gotten better though. It is not perfect. There is a much better relationship, and the refuge and the ranchers work closer together. In fact, during this fire in 2012, the refuge actually opened itself up to the ranchers for hay and feed because theirs was burned out because of this big fire. So there was a better spirit there. But there are still these problems: the threat of waters of the U.S. shutting down stock ponds and irrigation canals and a way of life, the threat of fire every year that seems to not be battled right and just gets away, and no one is really held accountable; the continued restriction on the lives of the men and women who, for generations, have worked hard in a tough environment. It has just gone too far. It is hurtful. I hope people understand how serious this is felt and how heartfelt this is by those who pay their taxes and try and live by the law and do the right things and how oppressed they feel by the government that they elect and the government they certainly don't elect, and how much they will always defend the flag and the country, and their sons and daughters would go to war, some will not come back--and they have not from this area. There is a better solution here. The President needs to back off on the monument. The BLM needs to make sure Susie Hammond isn't pushed into bankruptcy and has her ranch taken by the government and added to those that have been. We need to be better at hearing people from all walks of life and all regions of our country and understanding this anger that is out there and what we can do to bring about correct change and peaceful resolution. It is not too late. We can do this. It is a great country. We have the processes to do it right. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H7-H9] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HARNEY COUNTY, OREGON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham).

So yesterday, Dwight and Steve went to prison again. Dwight will be 73 when he gets out. Steve will be about 50. Meanwhile, in Harney County, on the ranch, Susie will continue to try and survive; 6,000-acre ranch, she needs grazing permits to make this happen. It would be a cruel and unjust act, by the way, if access to those grazing permits that allow that ranch to work were not extended. What possible good could come out of bankrupting a grandmother that was trying to keep a ranch together, while the husband sits in prison, her son sits in prison? What possible good? They will serve their sentences. There is nothing, short of clemency that only the President can offer, that we can do. But we can change that law, and we should, so that nobody ever is locked in like that for a situation like this, where a senior judge, literally, on his final day on the bench, says this goes too far, it goes too far. They appealed that, by the way, and lost. But I believe that the judge was right. We have to listen to the people. We have to understand why events like this are taking place in our communities. They are taking place in cities. We have witnessed that, and we try and get our heads around it. There are more people from the cities, so there are more Members from the cities. There aren't many of us that represent these vast, wide- open, incredibly beautiful, harsh districts like the one I do. The people there love the land. It was the ranchers who came up with the concept of the cooperative management. It was the ranchers who loved Steens Mountain that know that for them to survive they have to take care of the range. {time} 1945 They are good people. Their sons and daughters, by a higher proportion, fight in our wars and die, and I have been to their funerals. So to my friends across eastern Oregon, I will always fight for you. But we have to understand there is a time and a way. Hopefully the country through this understands we have a real problem in America: how we manage our lands and how we are losing them. It is not like we haven't tried here, Mr. Speaker. Year after year we pass bipartisan legislation to provide more active management on our forests so we don't lose them all to fire, and we are losing them all to fire. We are losing firefighters' lives, homes, and watersheds-- great resources of the West. Teddy Roosevelt would role over in his grave. He created this wildlife refuge in 1908. There were some bad actors there in the 1980s, by the way. They were very aggressive running the refuge, basically threatening eminent domain and other things that took ranches. It was bad. That lasted for at least a decade or more. It has gotten better though. It is not perfect. There is a much better relationship, and the refuge and the ranchers work closer together. In fact, during this fire in 2012, the refuge actually opened itself up to the ranchers for hay and feed because theirs was burned out because of this big fire. So there was a better spirit there. But there are still these problems: the threat of waters of the U.S. shutting down stock ponds and irrigation canals and a way of life, the threat of fire every year that seems to not be battled right and just gets away, and no one is really held accountable; the continued restriction on the lives of the men and women who, for generations, have worked hard in a tough environment. It has just gone too far. It is hurtful. I hope people understand how serious this is felt and how heartfelt this is by those who pay their taxes and try and live by the law and do the right things and how oppressed they feel by the government that they elect and the government they certainly don't elect, and how much they will always defend the flag and the country, and their sons and daughters would go to war, some will not come back--and they have not from this area. There is a better solution here. The President needs to back off on the monument. The BLM needs to make sure Susie Hammond isn't pushed into bankruptcy and has her ranch taken by the government and added to those that have been. We need to be better at hearing people from all walks of life and all regions of our country and understanding this anger that is out there and what we can do to bring about correct change and peaceful resolution. It is not too late. We can do this. It is a great country. We have the processes to do it right. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_261.csv,19057,19057,19125,"[congressional record volume 162, number 2 (tuesday, january 5, 2016)] [house] [pages h7-h9] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] harney county, oregon the speaker pro tempore (mr. abraham). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from oregon (mr. walden) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. walden. mr. speaker, i am sure my colleagues are aware of the situation in harney county, oregon, where a group of armed protesters have overtaken a federal facility in the malheur national wildlife refuge. this group is led largely by people who are not necessarily from oregon, although they obviously have supporters from oregon. they were originally there to protest the sentencing of dwight and steve hammond. i know the hammonds. i have known them for probably close to 20 years. they are longtime, responsible ranchers in harney county. they have been sentenced to prison not once, but now twice. i will get into that in a moment. the point i want to make at the outset is for people in this chamber to understand what drives people to do what is happening tonight in harney county. i have had the great honor and privilege to represent harney county for a number of years. i have seen the impact of federal policies from the clinton administration to the obama administration. i have seen what happens when overzealous bureaucrats and agencies go beyond the law and clamp down on people. i have seen what courts have done. i have seen the time for congress to act and then it has not. i want to put this area in perspective because i think it is really important to understand how big this region is. by size, my congressional district in oregon is something like the seventh or eighth biggest in the congress. if you overlaid it over the east coast, it would start in the atlantic and end in ohio. the county where this occupation is taking place--harney county--is over 10,000 square miles. there are 7,000 souls inhabiting it. if my math is right, that is one person for every 1.4 miles. one person for every 1.4 miles. just this one county is 10 times the size of rhode island. it is larger than the state of maryland. and 72 percent of it is under the command and control of the federal government. it is the public's land. that is true. but what people don't understand is the culture, the lifestyle, of the great american west and how much these ranchers care about the environment, about the future, about their children, about america, and how much they believe in the constitution. now we see the extent they will go to in order to defend what they view as their constitutional rights. now, i am not defending armed takeovers. i do not think that is appropriate. i think the time has come for those to consider that they have made their case in the public about what is happening in the west, and perhaps it is time for them to realize they have made their case and to go home. but i want to talk about what happened with the hammonds. i want to put in perspective what happens almost every year in my district. that is these enormous wildfires. {time} 1930 the miller homestead wildfire in 2012 burned 160,000 acres, mostly in this county, if not all; 250 square miles, a quarter of the size of the state of rhode island. that was just in 2012. the barry point fire that year, in lake county, next door, burned 93,000 acres. last summer alone, we burned 799,974 acres across oregon; that is both forest and high desert. in 2012, 3.4 million acres burned in oregon. there was another fire in malheur county. the long draw fire, in 2012, burned 557,000 acres, five times the size of rhode island. so 93,000 acres, 557,000 acres, 160,000 acres, all burning. the hammonds are in prison tonight for setting a backfire that they admit to, that burned 139 acres, and they will sit in prison, time served and time going forward, 5 years, under a law that i would argue was never intended to mete out that kind of punishment, and i will get to that in a moment. i have told you i worked with the hammonds and many ranchers in harney county. in the last years of the clinton administration, despite their own agency's reviews and analysis, bill clinton threatened to create a giant monument on steens mountain. when secretary babbitt, the interior secretary at the time, came before the house resources committee, of which i was a member, i said: mr. secretary, your own resource advisory committees in the area just reported that [[page h8]] there was no need for additional protection on steens mountain, and yet, you and the president are threatening to create this national monument. why do you waste the time of the citizens to go through a process to determine if additional protections are needed and then ignore what they came up with? to bruce babbitt's credit, he agreed when i told him: i think you would be surprised about what the local ranchers and citizens of harney county would be willing to do if you give them a chance. to his credit, he said: all right, i will give them that chance. and he did. we went to work on legislation. it took a full year. i worked with the hammonds. i worked with stacy davies, i worked with all kinds of folks, put a staffer on it full-time, multiple staffs, and we worked with the environmental community and others. and we created the steens mountain cooperative management and protection act, model legislation, never been done before, because i said: we don't have to live by past laws, we write laws. so we wrote a new law to create a cooperative spirit of management in harney county. the hammonds were part of that discussion. we saved a running camp, harlan priority runs. we protected inholder. we tried to do all the right things and create the kind of partnership and cooperation that the federal government and the citizens should have. fast forward on that particular law. not long after that became law, and it was heralded as this monumental law of great significance and new era in cooperation and spirit of cooperation, some of those involved on the other side and some of the agencies decided to reinterpret it. the first thing they tried to do is shut down this kids' running camp because they said: well, too many, maybe more than 20, run down this canyon and back up, as they had for many, many years. they wanted to shut it down. so we had to fight them back and said: no, the law says historical standards. then the bureaucrats, because we said: you should have your historical access to your private property, if you are up on steens mountain, you should maintain that access like you have always had it. do you know what the bureaucrats said? they began to solicit from the inholders in this area: how many times did you go up there last year? you see, they wanted to put a noose around the neck of those who were inside. that was a total violation of what we intended, and we had to back them off. see, the bureaucracy wants to interpret the laws we write in ways they want, and in this case they were wrong, not once, but twice. then, a couple of years ago, i learned that, despite the fact we created the first cow-free wilderness in the united states under this law, and said clearly in this law that it would be the responsibility of the government to put up fencing to keep the cows out, as part of the agreement, the bureau of land management said: no, we are not going to follow that law. and they told the ranchers they had to build the fence. i networked with my democrat colleague from oregon, mr. defazio, who was part of writing this law. i said: peter, you remember that, right? he said: yeah, i didn't like it, but that was the case. blm still wouldn't listen. so we continued to push it and they argued back. well, it turns out there had been a second rancher who brought this to my attention who they were telling had to do the same thing, build a fence, when the government was supposed to under the law i wrote. the arrogance of the agency was such that they said: we don't agree with you. now, there aren't many times, mr. speaker, in this job when you can say i know what the intent of the law was, but in this case i could because i wrote the law, i knew the intent. oh, that wasn't good enough. no, no, no. no, no, no. the arrogance of these agency people was such that we had to go to the archives and drag out the boxes from 2000, 1999-2000, when we wrote this law, from the hearings that had all the records for the hearings and the floor discussions to talk about the intent. and our retired member, george miller, actually we used some of his information where he said the government would provide the fencing. they were still reluctant to follow it. so i put language in the appropriations bill that restated the federal law. do you understand how frustrated i am at this? can you imagine how the people on the ground feel? can you imagine? if you are not there, you can't. if you are not there, you can't. you ridicule them. the portland oregonian is running a thing, what do you send? meals for militia. let's have fun with this. this is not a laughing matter from any consequence. nobody is going to win out of this thing. this is a government that has gone too far for too long. now, i am not condoning this takeover in any way. i want to make that clear. i don't think it is appropriate. there is a right to protest. i think they have gone too far. but i understand and hear their anger. right now, this administration, secretly, but not so much, is threatening, in the next county over, that looks a lot like this one, malheur county, to force a monument of 2.5 million acres, we believe. i think this is outrageous. it flies in the face of the people and the way of life and the public access. there is a company, keen shoes, that already has a big marketing campaign. this is about selling shoes, for god's sake. i call on the president, if he wants to help reduce the tension that is out there, to walk away from this. and if he doesn't want to walk away and say, no, we are not going to do that, to help us bring down this level of frustration and anger, then at least be honest, or his secretary of the interior needs to be honest with us and tell us they are going to do it. either they are or they aren't. but all they are is being coy. that feeds into this. it feeds into the anger that i feel. it feeds into the anger out there. so the president should say: i am not going to do a national monument. i am not going to add more fuel on this fire in the west. we have fought other issues. more than half of my district is under federal management, or lack thereof. they have come out with these proposals to close roads into the forests. they have ignored public input. they often claim to have all these open meetings and listen to the public, and then, in the case of wallowa-whitman, the forest supervisor who was eventually relieved because of this, i believe, completely ignored all the meetings, all the input, all the work of the counties and the local people, and said: forget it, i am going my own direction. there were 900 people that turned out at the national guard armory where they had a public hearing, standing room only and beyond, furious. you see, how do you have faith in a government that doesn't ever listen to you? how do you have faith in a government that, when elected representatives write a law, those charged with the responsibility of implementing it choose to go the other direction and not do so? that is what is breaking faith between the american people and their government, and that is what has to change. the other thing that has to change, the law under which the hammonds were sentenced. now, they probably did some things that weren't legal. i have given you the size of the acreages that burned naturally. i haven't gotten into the discussion about how these fires are often fought and how the federal government frequently will go on private land and set a fire without permission to backburn. that happens all the time. in fact, in the barry point fire down in lake county, they set fire on private timber land as a backburn while the owners of the property were putting out spot fires down in the canyon. i drove down there afterwards. they are darn lucky to have come out alive. there was nobody sentenced under the terrorism act there. oh, heck no. it is the government. they weren't sentenced. nobody was charged. oh, it just happened. now, fires are tough to fight. i have great respect for firefighters. there are always two sides on how these fires get fought. but i can tell you, a few years back in harney county, because i went and held a meeting out there right as the fire was being put out, that the fire crews came in, went on private ground, lit a backfire on private ground, behind a fence line, that then burned out the farmer's fence, the rancher's fence, and burned all the way over and down into [[page h9]] a canyon where there was a wetland, which would have been the natural break to stop the fire from the other side. you see, they never needed to burn that land. these things happen in the course of fighting fire. it doesn't mean they are right. but rare is it that somebody ends up 5 years in prison. let me tell you what the senior judge said when he sentenced the hammonds the first time, judge michael hogan, senior federal judge, highly respected in oregon. he sentenced dwight hammond to 3 months and steve to a year. there were different offenses here. he said: ``i am not going to apply the mandatory minimum because, to me, to do so, under the eighth amendment, would result in a sentence which is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offenses here.'' the judge went on to say: ``and with regard to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996, this sort of conduct would not have been conduct intended under the statute. ``when you ask, you know, what if you burn sagebrush in the suburbs of los angeles, and there are homes up the ravines, it might apply. out in the wilderness here, i don't think that is what the congress intended. ``in addition, it just would not meet any idea i have of justice proportionality. it would be a sentence which would shock the conscience, to me.'' senior judge mike hogan, when he did the original sentencing. but, you see, under this 1996 law under which they were charged and convicted, it turns out he had no judicial leeway. he could not mete out a sentence that was proportionate to what the crime was. so yesterday, dwight and steve went to prison again. dwight will be 73 when he gets out. steve will be about 50. meanwhile, in harney county, on the ranch, susie will continue to try and survive; 6,000-acre ranch, she needs grazing permits to make this happen. it would be a cruel and unjust act, by the way, if access to those grazing permits that allow that ranch to work were not extended. what possible good could come out of bankrupting a grandmother that was trying to keep a ranch together, while the husband sits in prison, her son sits in prison? what possible good? they will serve their sentences. there is nothing, short of clemency that only the president can offer, that we can do. but we can change that law, and we should, so that nobody ever is locked in like that for a situation like this, where a senior judge, literally, on his final day on the bench, says this goes too far, it goes too far. they appealed that, by the way, and lost. but i believe that the judge was right. we have to listen to the people. we have to understand why events like this are taking place in our communities. they are taking place in cities. we have witnessed that, and we try and get our heads around it. there are more people from the cities, so there are more members from the cities. there aren't many of us that represent these vast, wide- open, incredibly beautiful, harsh districts like the one i do. the people there love the land. it was the ranchers who came up with the concept of the cooperative management. it was the ranchers who loved steens mountain that know that for them to survive they have to take care of the range. {time} 1945 they are good people. their sons and daughters, by a higher proportion, fight in our wars and die, and i have been to their funerals. so to my friends across eastern oregon, i will always fight for you. but we have to understand there is a time and a way. hopefully the country through this understands we have a real problem in america: how we manage our lands and how we are losing them. it is not like we haven't tried here, mr. speaker. year after year we pass bipartisan legislation to provide more active management on our forests so we don't lose them all to fire, and we are losing them all to fire. we are losing firefighters' lives, homes, and watersheds-- great resources of the west. teddy roosevelt would role over in his grave. he created this wildlife refuge in 1908. there were some bad actors there in the 1980s, by the way. they were very aggressive running the refuge, basically threatening eminent domain and other things that took ranches. it was bad. that lasted for at least a decade or more. it has gotten better though. it is not perfect. there is a much better relationship, and the refuge and the ranchers work closer together. in fact, during this fire in 2012, the refuge actually opened itself up to the ranchers for hay and feed because theirs was burned out because of this big fire. so there was a better spirit there. but there are still these problems: the threat of waters of the u.s. shutting down stock ponds and irrigation canals and a way of life, the threat of fire every year that seems to not be battled right and just gets away, and no one is really held accountable; the continued restriction on the lives of the men and women who, for generations, have worked hard in a tough environment. it has just gone too far. it is hurtful. i hope people understand how serious this is felt and how heartfelt this is by those who pay their taxes and try and live by the law and do the right things and how oppressed they feel by the government that they elect and the government they certainly don't elect, and how much they will always defend the flag and the country, and their sons and daughters would go to war, some will not come back--and they have not from this area. there is a better solution here. the president needs to back off on the monument. the blm needs to make sure susie hammond isn't pushed into bankruptcy and has her ranch taken by the government and added to those that have been. we need to be better at hearing people from all walks of life and all regions of our country and understanding this anger that is out there and what we can do to bring about correct change and peaceful resolution. it is not too late. we can do this. it is a great country. we have the processes to do it right. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",19057

CREC-2016-01-05-pt1-PgH9,CREC-2016-01-05,114,CRIMINALIZATION BY REGULATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H9-H12] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CRIMINALIZATION BY REGULATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the words of my friend from Oregon. These are difficult times, and it is even more difficult when unfairness comes from the United States Government with all its power, with all its resources, when it begins to pick on American citizens, when it uses its resources to snoop on Americans, especially when it uses resources to spy on Americans in order to help maintain power of the government over the people. One of the problems with ObamaCare is it provides every American's medical records to the Federal Government--as if the Federal Government didn't have enough personal information. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in the process of gathering people's credit card and debit card information supposedly to protect individuals. What we have seen in our Judiciary Committee as we have had hearings on the abuses by Federal Government bureaucrats is there seems to be this desire among different agencies and departments: They have no business having a SWAT team, but they want one. They want military power to go out and take people down whenever they get ready. For many years, Congress has not done an appropriate job of keeping in check criminal laws. There are far too many criminal laws, the number of which we don't know exactly, but which allow a violation of a regulation to be a crime, which allows the full power of the Federal Government to go after individuals. We heard the horror story about the fellow from the Northwest trying the create a better battery. He gets run off the road by three black Suburbans, hauled out of his little gas-efficient car, thrown down on his chest, boot in the back, handcuffs on, and no idea what he had done. He never even had a traffic ticket. It turns out that he hadn't violated any law necessarily, but he had mailed a package to Alaska [[Page H10]] that he knew needed to go by ground only, so he checked the box ``ground only.'' He didn't know that he needed a little sticker with an airplane with a line through it. So he didn't put that on. The result was he was run off the road, thrown to the ground, handcuffed, dragged to jail, then drug off because the Federal Government gets to pick their venue. And since they knew he didn't really know people in Alaska, and that is where the package was going, they dragged him to Alaska to prosecute there. When he was finally acquitted--maybe it was jury nullification, they just thought it was too unfair--then the prosecutors, the power of the Federal Government and the vindictive people that control things, decided they couldn't let him get away with only having done months in jail; so, having ransacked his home under a search warrant because he didn't put the little sticker on the package he mailed, they went back through all of the accounting of items found, the inventory, and found that there were some chemicals that are required not to be abandoned, and a regulation--again, a regulation some bureaucrats put in place, not Congress--that required those substances were never to be left for more than 14 days. Since the prosecutors had had him dragged off to Alaska and put in jail up there, he was involuntarily forced to leave the substances. They were properly stored, but they were successful in prosecuting him for abandoning the substances. Or the retired gentleman down in Houston who wasn't able to testify before our committee because he had had a stroke while he was incarcerated because of the overaggressive prosecution by the Federal Government. He had a greenhouse and raised orchids. He sold to some local florists. He had gotten a package from South America. Apparently, it wasn't properly packaged according to some bureaucrat's regulations, and therefore he had his home raided and ransacked. His wife testified she called home and didn't recognize the voice of the person answering. She asked who it was. He said: Well, who is this? She said: I called my home to talk to my husband, and I have a right to know who you are. Well, it was a Federal agent. He was handcuffed in his own kitchen because somebody sent him a package from South America that didn't meet some cubicle jockey's idea of what was properly sending a package. During the year and a half he was imprisoned, he had a stroke and couldn't communicate. Or the poor guy that had lobster shipped to him. He was arrested, incarcerated, and charged with violating not American law, but American law that says, if you violate a foreign law, then you can be arrested in America, and they alleged that he violated a Caribbean island's laws. That country's attorney general said: No, we don't believe he violated our laws. Nonetheless, he was incarcerated. The stories go on and on of abuse when a government becomes all powerful the way this one has come close to being. When Congress doesn't adequately rein it in, there doesn't seem to be a lot of hope for Americans across the country to be able to stand in the face of such an overwhelming power as our Federal Government. So I appreciate my friend from Oregon talking about the situation with the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service. It seems that there are people within the Interior Department that have an insatiable appetite for acquiring more and more and more land, and more and more and more private property taken away from private individuals. It is getting out of control. If any landowner dares to say, ``I want to keep my own private property,'' then they can have a right to worry that the Federal Government will come after them, harass them, and make their lives miserable until they finally consent. It is why we should have removed the President's ability to just name land as a national monument, as President Clinton did, one of the world's largest deposits of coal in Utah, just put it off limits by calling it a national monument. It was never intended for those purposes. That is why we should have ended-- well, actually, it had ended the program that allowed billions of dollars to be accumulated and spent buying more and more land for the government to control. {time} 2000 It is very difficult in my district. It is not like the Federal Government owns one big swath of land. It can surround private property and make the lives of private property owners miserable, make it unbearable, being a horrible neighbor. Even if the Federal Government doesn't own the private property, they can make usage of that property very unpleasant. Is it any wonder right now in America that Donald Trump is leading in the Republican primary in so many of the polls? Ted Cruz is viewed as an outsider, though he is in the Senate, because he stood up against the establishment, the status quo. Americans are tired of the Federal Government being unaccountable and becoming so big that it is out of control. Having prosecuted felony cases early in my career, having been a judge handling thousands of felony cases in Texas, I understand crime. I understand how it has to be stopped. But I also see when the Federal Government becomes a part of the problem instead of part of the solution. When we had this horrendous shooting in San Bernardino, so many people killed at a Christmas party--or this administration preferred to call it a ``holiday party''--where Christians and Jews get singled out, of course this administration won't prosecute a hate crime against a Christian or a Jew and then continue to warn us that they certainly will protect against any hate crime against a Muslim. Nonetheless, we find out there was a straw buyer who broke the gun laws to buy a weapon for the killers. We don't need a new gun law. The man violated the gun laws. And then we found out that actually this administration has been prosecuting fewer gun violations than the Bush administration, and in recent years continues to prosecute fewer and fewer and fewer gun violations. If one were cynical--especially in view of the Washington adage that no matter how cynical you get in this town, it is never enough to catch up--you might say: Wait a minute. This administration, for example, compared to the Bush administration--in '04, the Bush administration prosecuted nearly 9,000 gun violation cases brought by the ATF. This administration, in 2013, prosecuted around 5,000, and it has prosecuted fewer each year since. It is almost as if--and I know there wouldn't be an improper motive. The House rules tell us that. But it is almost as if you had an administration that is not prosecuting gun violations so they can turn around and demand more laws restricting law-abiding gun rights because, if they really wanted to stop gun violence, they would be prosecuting more aggressively. When we think about the losses of lives, all the lives that could be saved if this administration would simply enforce the laws that exist, it is heartbreaking. You think about those families who lost a loved one because this administration didn't prosecute the gun violations that could have stopped those losses of lives. It is tragic that this administration will continue to clamber for more laws when the solution should lie first in enforcement of the laws we have before it clambers for more laws. There is an article published January 5, 2016, saying: ``Obama Announces Gun Control Actions, Expands Background Checks'' on FOX News. The article says: ``The President, speaking at the White House, said background checks `make a difference' and will be expanded so that they can cover purchases online, at gun shows and in other venues.'' It quotes the President saying: ``Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions.'' Mr. Speaker, we have got to get President Obama some good help. The people around him certainly would not be dishonest enough to misrepresent to the President what the law is, but somebody is misrepresenting to the President what is true and what isn't because we know he would not be dishonest. He would certainly not intentionally misrepresent to the public when he says that you can just go online and buy a gun without a background check when that is not true. [[Page H11]] If you are a criminal, I am sure it is true that that could be done. But for law-abiding individuals, the kind that don't go out and commit crimes, they followed the law. The law requires for gun dealers, whether it is a transaction over the Internet or not, there has to be a background check. But somebody keeps feeding the President false information that he passes on to the United States citizenry. We have got to get the President some help so he can get the facts straight that he conveys to the American public. I haven't bought a gun online, but talking to people that have, if you go online to buy a gun, there is going to be a background check. You cannot just have the gun mailed to you. You have to go to a gun store. They don't really appreciate having you buy a weapon online and then come to the store where they have brick and mortar invested in the local economy. They are the ones that have to make sure the law is complied with. But you can't just go online and buy a gun unless you are an outlaw already violating the law, in which case more laws won't make a difference. Only enforcement of existing laws would stop that kind of conduct. There is an article from Paul Bedard, January 5: ``Obama's New Gun Control Force 8X the Size of Pentagon's ISIS Commando Team.'' It points out: ``According to a White House fact sheet, the President plans to deploy 200 more Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents `to help enforce our gun laws.' ``He also plans to add at least 230 new FBI agents to pore over the backgrounds of gun buyers . . . In Iraq, by comparison, the White House is moving to install an estimated 50-200 Special Operations Forces to take down ISIS.'' Here again, it is not enough to simply add FBI or ATF agents when this administration refuses to prosecute gun violations, gun law violations, even as aggressively as the Bush administration did. Of course, this administration seems to think the Bush administration was too lax on gun policy, but yet they won't even prosecute but a fraction of the cases that the Bush administration did. It is also worth noting that, when this article compares to the actions in Iraq, having been to the command center there in northern Iraq myself, having talked to people on the ground there, having talked to people who have done surveys, done studies of what is going on there with ISIS, you find out this administration, yeah, they are sending planes up, but a majority of the ordnances aren't dropped. Apparently, according to one source, even though they see trucks carrying weapons to ISIS, they are not allowed to take the trucks out. If they see supplies going to ISIS, they are not allowed to stop them. They are not allowed to crater the road they are using. This administration has rules of engagement in place that don't allow the United States to actually defend ourselves against ISIS. Is it any wonder that it was reported that the radical Islamist terrorists in the Middle East have no fear of this administration or of America because they see how ridiculous the restrictions are that we put on ourselves, our fighting people? They fear, more, Israel because Israel will take legitimate actions to win. {time} 2015 There is an article from AWR Hawkins, 5 January 2016, which reads, ``A January 4 White House executive order fact sheet previews the executive gun controls Obama will announce Tuesday. ``The five most offensive aspects of those controls: ``One, the main policy would not have stopped any recent mass shootings,'' which would indicate--since that appears to be the fact, that nothing he has proposed would change the mass shootings--then, obviously, they are more concerned about either, A, putting on a show or, B, curtailing law-abiding citizens more than actually stopping the mass shootings. ``Two, 225 years of precedent destroyed without any legislative due process.'' Some say, ``Yes. But we already have background checks. So the President is not changing that.'' The law is very clear as to what a gun dealer is. He is somebody who is in the business of selling guns. This administration is now saying, ``Hey, if you sell one gun, that can mean being in the business,'' and that has never been the law. This President is unilaterally attempting to change the law so that, if an uncle wants to sell to his nephew, then this President would try to be a wedge there. We are not going to prosecute nearly the gun violations like the Bush administration did, but, yes, we will come after that uncle and get between the uncle and the nephew. We are going to be as big an impediment to law-abiding citizens as possible in the way this administration is approaching this; whereas, we are turning a blind eye to so much of the criminal activity, which is the way it appears. This article from TheBlaze, ``Obama's Executive Action on Guns Changes Privacy Rules Between Doctor and Patient,'' talks about how it will push doctors to report patients they believe may have a problem with the proper use of guns. It is putting a wedge between doctors and patients. Another article here is from Stephen Gutowski: ``Obama Executive Order May Require Those Selling Even a Single Firearm to Become Licensed Dealers.'' That is not the law. This President is changing the law without there being the congressional passage of a law that he would sign. Another article is from John Lott, dated January 5. Dr. Lott knows the gun laws and knows the gun facts. This is from the National Review. Dr. Lott points out, if you really want to fix things, don't charge gun buyers for the background checks. Fix the system so it stops falsely flagging the law-abiding people. This article also points out that 99 percent of the flags turn out to be improper flags. Three, stop using background checks as de facto registration, which appears to be what they are actually trying to do. The article from Kelly Riddell, dated July 23, 2014, points out ``Obama's Empty Tough Talk: Gun Prosecutions Plummet on His Watch,'' with the numbers and figures to back that up. By failing to prosecute gun violations while pressing for more gun laws, it makes one wonder if that is kind of akin to our servicemembers who are in harm's way. For example, in Afghanistan, in the 7\1/4\ years under Commander in Chief George W. Bush, I believe the number of precious American military lives lost was just over 500. Under Commander in Chief Obama, I believe it is at least three times that many or more than that. What is different? The war is supposed to have basically gone away. We ended it, according to the President. Yet, under his command, people got killed in multiples when the war was supposedly over. Our military members tell me it is the rules of engagement. We can't defend ourselves. We have a motorcyclist terrorist--a radical Jihadist--come blazing up toward a checkpoint, killing people. You realize, wow, we have a lieutenant that this administration, under Commander Obama, sent to Fort Leavenworth--to prison--for, apparently, giving the order to shoot an Afghan on a motorcycle because he was not slowing down as ordered, he was not yielding to the gunfire over his head. A good way to get Americans killed is to put them in prison if they try to defend themselves or those under their command. So it just leaves you with the question: Who is this administration really trying to protect? Are we trying to protect our own military members who are in harm's way? It doesn't appear so. Not enforcing the laws against criminals for their gun violations and, instead, demanding more and more control over law-abiding citizens in their use of weapons. Mr. Speaker, I know a lot of seniors who may not be able to tell you how much money is in their bank accounts; so, they have someone helping them with their bank accounts. But they can sure tell you when somebody is breaking into their homes and when they need a weapon. We were taught in my 4 years in the Army that a gun is a great equalizer. So if you are 85 years old and somebody is breaking into your home--someone who is strong and powerful and can break your body over his knee--a gun is a great equalizer. But under this [[Page H12]] President, if you are not managing your own account, look out. This administration is going to leave you unprotected against those intruders. It is time America started responding, Mr. Speaker. It is time this year that Americans made clear that we want an administration in America that is more concerned about the law-abiding people than it is with taking away the rights of law-abiding Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [House] [Pages H9-H12] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CRIMINALIZATION BY REGULATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the words of my friend from Oregon. These are difficult times, and it is even more difficult when unfairness comes from the United States Government with all its power, with all its resources, when it begins to pick on American citizens, when it uses its resources to snoop on Americans, especially when it uses resources to spy on Americans in order to help maintain power of the government over the people. One of the problems with ObamaCare is it provides every American's medical records to the Federal Government--as if the Federal Government didn't have enough personal information. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in the process of gathering people's credit card and debit card information supposedly to protect individuals. What we have seen in our Judiciary Committee as we have had hearings on the abuses by Federal Government bureaucrats is there seems to be this desire among different agencies and departments: They have no business having a SWAT team, but they want one. They want military power to go out and take people down whenever they get ready. For many years, Congress has not done an appropriate job of keeping in check criminal laws. There are far too many criminal laws, the number of which we don't know exactly, but which allow a violation of a regulation to be a crime, which allows the full power of the Federal Government to go after individuals. We heard the horror story about the fellow from the Northwest trying the create a better battery. He gets run off the road by three black Suburbans, hauled out of his little gas-efficient car, thrown down on his chest, boot in the back, handcuffs on, and no idea what he had done. He never even had a traffic ticket. It turns out that he hadn't violated any law necessarily, but he had mailed a package to Alaska [[Page H10]] that he knew needed to go by ground only, so he checked the box ``ground only.'' He didn't know that he needed a little sticker with an airplane with a line through it. So he didn't put that on. The result was he was run off the road, thrown to the ground, handcuffed, dragged to jail, then drug off because the Federal Government gets to pick their venue. And since they knew he didn't really know people in Alaska, and that is where the package was going, they dragged him to Alaska to prosecute there. When he was finally acquitted--maybe it was jury nullification, they just thought it was too unfair--then the prosecutors, the power of the Federal Government and the vindictive people that control things, decided they couldn't let him get away with only having done months in jail; so, having ransacked his home under a search warrant because he didn't put the little sticker on the package he mailed, they went back through all of the accounting of items found, the inventory, and found that there were some chemicals that are required not to be abandoned, and a regulation--again, a regulation some bureaucrats put in place, not Congress--that required those substances were never to be left for more than 14 days. Since the prosecutors had had him dragged off to Alaska and put in jail up there, he was involuntarily forced to leave the substances. They were properly stored, but they were successful in prosecuting him for abandoning the substances. Or the retired gentleman down in Houston who wasn't able to testify before our committee because he had had a stroke while he was incarcerated because of the overaggressive prosecution by the Federal Government. He had a greenhouse and raised orchids. He sold to some local florists. He had gotten a package from South America. Apparently, it wasn't properly packaged according to some bureaucrat's regulations, and therefore he had his home raided and ransacked. His wife testified she called home and didn't recognize the voice of the person answering. She asked who it was. He said: Well, who is this? She said: I called my home to talk to my husband, and I have a right to know who you are. Well, it was a Federal agent. He was handcuffed in his own kitchen because somebody sent him a package from South America that didn't meet some cubicle jockey's idea of what was properly sending a package. During the year and a half he was imprisoned, he had a stroke and couldn't communicate. Or the poor guy that had lobster shipped to him. He was arrested, incarcerated, and charged with violating not American law, but American law that says, if you violate a foreign law, then you can be arrested in America, and they alleged that he violated a Caribbean island's laws. That country's attorney general said: No, we don't believe he violated our laws. Nonetheless, he was incarcerated. The stories go on and on of abuse when a government becomes all powerful the way this one has come close to being.

And since they knew he didn't really know people in Alaska, and that is where the package was going, they dragged him to Alaska to prosecute there. When he was finally acquitted--maybe it was jury nullification, they just thought it was too unfair--then the prosecutors, the power of the Federal Government and the vindictive people that control things, decided they couldn't let him get away with only having done months in jail; so, having ransacked his home under a search warrant because he didn't put the little sticker on the package he mailed, they went back through all of the accounting of items found, the inventory, and found that there were some chemicals that are required not to be abandoned, and a regulation--again, a regulation some bureaucrats put in place, not Congress--that required those substances were never to be left for more than 14 days. Since the prosecutors had had him dragged off to Alaska and put in jail up there, he was involuntarily forced to leave the substances. They were properly stored, but they were successful in prosecuting him for abandoning the substances. Or the retired gentleman down in Houston who wasn't able to testify before our committee because he had had a stroke while he was incarcerated because of the overaggressive prosecution by the Federal Government. He had a greenhouse and raised orchids. He sold to some local florists. He had gotten a package from South America. Apparently, it wasn't properly packaged according to some bureaucrat's regulations, and therefore he had his home raided and ransacked. His wife testified she called home and didn't recognize the voice of the person answering. She asked who it was. He said: Well, who is this? She said: I called my home to talk to my husband, and I have a right to know who you are. Well, it was a Federal agent. He was handcuffed in his own kitchen because somebody sent him a package from South America that didn't meet some cubicle jockey's idea of what was properly sending a package. During the year and a half he was imprisoned, he had a stroke and couldn't communicate. Or the poor guy that had lobster shipped to him. He was arrested, incarcerated, and charged with violating not American law, but American law that says, if you violate a foreign law, then you can be arrested in America, and they alleged that he violated a Caribbean island's laws. That country's attorney general said: No, we don't believe he violated our laws. Nonetheless, he was incarcerated. The stories go on and on of abuse when a government becomes all powerful the way this one has come close to being. When Congress doesn't adequately rein it in, there doesn't seem to be a lot of hope for Americans across the country to be able to stand in the face of such an overwhelming power as our Federal Government. So I appreciate my friend from Oregon talking about the situation with the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service. It seems that there are people within the Interior Department that have an insatiable appetite for acquiring more and more and more land, and more and more and more private property taken away from private individuals. It is getting out of control. If any landowner dares to say, ``I want to keep my own private property,'' then they can have a right to worry that the Federal Government will come after them, harass them, and make their lives miserable until they finally consent. It is why we should have removed the President's ability to just name land as a national monument, as President Clinton did, one of the world's largest deposits of coal in Utah, just put it off limits by calling it a national monument. It was never intended for those purposes. That is why we should have ended-- well, actually, it had ended the program that allowed billions of dollars to be accumulated and spent buying more and more land for the government to control. {time} 2000 It is very difficult in my district. It is not like the Federal Government owns one big swath of land. It can surround private property and make the lives of private property owners miserable, make it unbearable, being a horrible neighbor. Even if the Federal Government doesn't own the private property, they can make usage of that property very unpleasant. Is it any wonder right now in America that Donald Trump is leading in the Republican primary in so many of the polls? Ted Cruz is viewed as an outsider, though he is in the Senate, because he stood up against the establishment, the status quo. Americans are tired of the Federal Government being unaccountable and becoming so big that it is out of control. Having prosecuted felony cases early in my career, having been a judge handling thousands of felony cases in Texas, I understand crime. I understand how it has to be stopped. But I also see when the Federal Government becomes a part of the problem instead of part of the solution. When we had this horrendous shooting in San Bernardino, so many people killed at a Christmas party--or this administration preferred to call it a ``holiday party''--where Christians and Jews get singled out, of course this administration won't prosecute a hate crime against a Christian or a Jew and then continue to warn us that they certainly will protect against any hate crime against a Muslim. Nonetheless, we find out there was a straw buyer who broke the gun laws to buy a weapon for the killers. We don't need a new gun law. The man violated the gun laws. And then we found out that actually this administration has been prosecuting fewer gun violations than the Bush administration, and in recent years continues to prosecute fewer and fewer and fewer gun violations. If one were cynical--especially in view of the Washington adage that no matter how cynical you get in this town, it is never enough to catch up--you might say: Wait a minute. This administration, for example, compared to the Bush administration--in '04, the Bush administration prosecuted nearly 9,000 gun violation cases brought by the ATF. This administration, in 2013, prosecuted around 5,000, and it has prosecuted fewer each year since. It is almost as if--and I know there wouldn't be an improper motive. The House rules tell us that. But it is almost as if you had an administration that is not prosecuting gun violations so they can turn around and demand more laws restricting law-abiding gun rights because, if they really wanted to stop gun violence, they would be prosecuting more aggressively. When we think about the losses of lives, all the lives that could be saved if this administration would simply enforce the laws that exist, it is heartbreaking. You think about those families who lost a loved one because this administration didn't prosecute the gun violations that could have stopped those losses of lives. It is tragic that this administration will continue to clamber for more laws when the solution should lie first in enforcement of the laws we have before it clambers for more laws. There is an article published January 5, 2016, saying: ``Obama Announces Gun Control Actions, Expands Background Checks'' on FOX News. The article says: ``The President, speaking at the White House, said background checks `make a difference' and will be expanded so that they can cover purchases online, at gun shows and in other venues.'' It quotes the President saying: ``Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks or be subject to criminal prosecutions.'' Mr. Speaker, we have got to get President Obama some good help. The people around him certainly would not be dishonest enough to misrepresent to the President what the law is, but somebody is misrepresenting to the President what is true and what isn't because we know he would not be dishonest. He would certainly not intentionally misrepresent to the public when he says that you can just go online and buy a gun without a background check when that is not true. [[Page H11]] If you are a criminal, I am sure it is true that that could be done. But for law-abiding individuals, the kind that don't go out and commit crimes, they followed the law. The law requires for gun dealers, whether it is a transaction over the Internet or not, there has to be a background check. But somebody keeps feeding the President false information that he passes on to the United States citizenry. We have got to get the President some help so he can get the facts straight that he conveys to the American public. I haven't bought a gun online, but talking to people that have, if you go online to buy a gun, there is going to be a background check. You cannot just have the gun mailed to you. You have to go to a gun store. They don't really appreciate having you buy a weapon online and then come to the store where they have brick and mortar invested in the local economy. They are the ones that have to make sure the law is complied with. But you can't just go online and buy a gun unless you are an outlaw already violating the law, in which case more laws won't make a difference. Only enforcement of existing laws would stop that kind of conduct. There is an article from Paul Bedard, January 5: ``Obama's New Gun Control Force 8X the Size of Pentagon's ISIS Commando Team.'' It points out: ``According to a White House fact sheet, the President plans to deploy 200 more Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents `to help enforce our gun laws.' ``He also plans to add at least 230 new FBI agents to pore over the backgrounds of gun buyers . . . In Iraq, by comparison, the White House is moving to install an estimated 50-200 Special Operations Forces to take down ISIS.'' Here again, it is not enough to simply add FBI or ATF agents when this administration refuses to prosecute gun violations, gun law violations, even as aggressively as the Bush administration did. Of course, this administration seems to think the Bush administration was too lax on gun policy, but yet they won't even prosecute but a fraction of the cases that the Bush administration did. It is also worth noting that, when this article compares to the actions in Iraq, having been to the command center there in northern Iraq myself, having talked to people on the ground there, having talked to people who have done surveys, done studies of what is going on there with ISIS, you find out this administration, yeah, they are sending planes up, but a majority of the ordnances aren't dropped. Apparently, according to one source, even though they see trucks carrying weapons to ISIS, they are not allowed to take the trucks out. If they see supplies going to ISIS, they are not allowed to stop them. They are not allowed to crater the road they are using. This administration has rules of engagement in place that don't allow the United States to actually defend ourselves against ISIS. Is it any wonder that it was reported that the radical Islamist terrorists in the Middle East have no fear of this administration or of America because they see how ridiculous the restrictions are that we put on ourselves, our fighting people? They fear, more, Israel because Israel will take legitimate actions to win. {time} 2015 There is an article from AWR Hawkins, 5 January 2016, which reads, ``A January 4 White House executive order fact sheet previews the executive gun controls Obama will announce Tuesday. ``The five most offensive aspects of those controls: ``One, the main policy would not have stopped any recent mass shootings,'' which would indicate--since that appears to be the fact, that nothing he has proposed would change the mass shootings--then, obviously, they are more concerned about either, A, putting on a show or, B, curtailing law-abiding citizens more than actually stopping the mass shootings. ``Two, 225 years of precedent destroyed without any legislative due process.'' Some say, ``Yes. But we already have background checks. So the President is not changing that.'' The law is very clear as to what a gun dealer is. He is somebody who is in the business of selling guns. This administration is now saying, ``Hey, if you sell one gun, that can mean being in the business,'' and that has never been the law. This President is unilaterally attempting to change the law so that, if an uncle wants to sell to his nephew, then this President would try to be a wedge there. We are not going to prosecute nearly the gun violations like the Bush administration did, but, yes, we will come after that uncle and get between the uncle and the nephew. We are going to be as big an impediment to law-abiding citizens as possible in the way this administration is approaching this; whereas, we are turning a blind eye to so much of the criminal activity, which is the way it appears. This article from TheBlaze, ``Obama's Executive Action on Guns Changes Privacy Rules Between Doctor and Patient,'' talks about how it will push doctors to report patients they believe may have a problem with the proper use of guns. It is putting a wedge between doctors and patients. Another article here is from Stephen Gutowski: ``Obama Executive Order May Require Those Selling Even a Single Firearm to Become Licensed Dealers.'' That is not the law. This President is changing the law without there being the congressional passage of a law that he would sign. Another article is from John Lott, dated January 5. Dr. Lott knows the gun laws and knows the gun facts. This is from the National Review. Dr. Lott points out, if you really want to fix things, don't charge gun buyers for the background checks. Fix the system so it stops falsely flagging the law-abiding people. This article also points out that 99 percent of the flags turn out to be improper flags. Three, stop using background checks as de facto registration, which appears to be what they are actually trying to do. The article from Kelly Riddell, dated July 23, 2014, points out ``Obama's Empty Tough Talk: Gun Prosecutions Plummet on His Watch,'' with the numbers and figures to back that up. By failing to prosecute gun violations while pressing for more gun laws, it makes one wonder if that is kind of akin to our servicemembers who are in harm's way. For example, in Afghanistan, in the 7\1/4\ years under Commander in Chief George W. Bush, I believe the number of precious American military lives lost was just over 500. Under Commander in Chief Obama, I believe it is at least three times that many or more than that. What is different? The war is supposed to have basically gone away. We ended it, according to the President. Yet, under his command, people got killed in multiples when the war was supposedly over. Our military members tell me it is the rules of engagement. We can't defend ourselves. We have a motorcyclist terrorist--a radical Jihadist--come blazing up toward a checkpoint, killing people. You realize, wow, we have a lieutenant that this administration, under Commander Obama, sent to Fort Leavenworth--to prison--for, apparently, giving the order to shoot an Afghan on a motorcycle because he was not slowing down as ordered, he was not yielding to the gunfire over his head. A good way to get Americans killed is to put them in prison if they try to defend themselves or those under their command. So it just leaves you with the question: Who is this administration really trying to protect? Are we trying to protect our own military members who are in harm's way? It doesn't appear so. Not enforcing the laws against criminals for their gun violations and, instead, demanding more and more control over law-abiding citizens in their use of weapons. Mr. Speaker, I know a lot of seniors who may not be able to tell you how much money is in their bank accounts; so, they have someone helping them with their bank accounts. But they can sure tell you when somebody is breaking into their homes and when they need a weapon. We were taught in my 4 years in the Army that a gun is a great equalizer. So if you are 85 years old and somebody is breaking into your home--someone who is strong and powerful and can break your body over his knee--a gun is a great equalizer. But under this [[Page H12]] President, if you are not managing your own account, look out. This administration is going to leave you unprotected against those intruders. It is time America started responding, Mr. Speaker. It is time this year that Americans made clear that we want an administration in America that is more concerned about the law-abiding people than it is with taking away the rights of law-abiding Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_261.csv,19280,19280,19348,"[congressional record volume 162, number 2 (tuesday, january 5, 2016)] [house] [pages h9-h12] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] criminalization by regulation the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i do appreciate the words of my friend from oregon. these are difficult times, and it is even more difficult when unfairness comes from the united states government with all its power, with all its resources, when it begins to pick on american citizens, when it uses its resources to snoop on americans, especially when it uses resources to spy on americans in order to help maintain power of the government over the people. one of the problems with obamacare is it provides every american's medical records to the federal government--as if the federal government didn't have enough personal information. the consumer financial protection bureau is in the process of gathering people's credit card and debit card information supposedly to protect individuals. what we have seen in our judiciary committee as we have had hearings on the abuses by federal government bureaucrats is there seems to be this desire among different agencies and departments: they have no business having a swat team, but they want one. they want military power to go out and take people down whenever they get ready. for many years, congress has not done an appropriate job of keeping in check criminal laws. there are far too many criminal laws, the number of which we don't know exactly, but which allow a violation of a regulation to be a crime, which allows the full power of the federal government to go after individuals. we heard the horror story about the fellow from the northwest trying the create a better battery. he gets run off the road by three black suburbans, hauled out of his little gas-efficient car, thrown down on his chest, boot in the back, handcuffs on, and no idea what he had done. he never even had a traffic ticket. it turns out that he hadn't violated any law necessarily, but he had mailed a package to alaska [[page h10]] that he knew needed to go by ground only, so he checked the box ``ground only.'' he didn't know that he needed a little sticker with an airplane with a line through it. so he didn't put that on. the result was he was run off the road, thrown to the ground, handcuffed, dragged to jail, then drug off because the federal government gets to pick their venue. and since they knew he didn't really know people in alaska, and that is where the package was going, they dragged him to alaska to prosecute there. when he was finally acquitted--maybe it was jury nullification, they just thought it was too unfair--then the prosecutors, the power of the federal government and the vindictive people that control things, decided they couldn't let him get away with only having done months in jail; so, having ransacked his home under a search warrant because he didn't put the little sticker on the package he mailed, they went back through all of the accounting of items found, the inventory, and found that there were some chemicals that are required not to be abandoned, and a regulation--again, a regulation some bureaucrats put in place, not congress--that required those substances were never to be left for more than 14 days. since the prosecutors had had him dragged off to alaska and put in jail up there, he was involuntarily forced to leave the substances. they were properly stored, but they were successful in prosecuting him for abandoning the substances. or the retired gentleman down in houston who wasn't able to testify before our committee because he had had a stroke while he was incarcerated because of the overaggressive prosecution by the federal government. he had a greenhouse and raised orchids. he sold to some local florists. he had gotten a package from south america. apparently, it wasn't properly packaged according to some bureaucrat's regulations, and therefore he had his home raided and ransacked. his wife testified she called home and didn't recognize the voice of the person answering. she asked who it was. he said: well, who is this? she said: i called my home to talk to my husband, and i have a right to know who you are. well, it was a federal agent. he was handcuffed in his own kitchen because somebody sent him a package from south america that didn't meet some cubicle jockey's idea of what was properly sending a package. during the year and a half he was imprisoned, he had a stroke and couldn't communicate. or the poor guy that had lobster shipped to him. he was arrested, incarcerated, and charged with violating not american law, but american law that says, if you violate a foreign law, then you can be arrested in america, and they alleged that he violated a caribbean island's laws. that country's attorney general said: no, we don't believe he violated our laws. nonetheless, he was incarcerated. the stories go on and on of abuse when a government becomes all powerful the way this one has come close to being. when congress doesn't adequately rein it in, there doesn't seem to be a lot of hope for americans across the country to be able to stand in the face of such an overwhelming power as our federal government. so i appreciate my friend from oregon talking about the situation with the bureau of land management, fish and wildlife service. it seems that there are people within the interior department that have an insatiable appetite for acquiring more and more and more land, and more and more and more private property taken away from private individuals. it is getting out of control. if any landowner dares to say, ``i want to keep my own private property,'' then they can have a right to worry that the federal government will come after them, harass them, and make their lives miserable until they finally consent. it is why we should have removed the president's ability to just name land as a national monument, as president clinton did, one of the world's largest deposits of coal in utah, just put it off limits by calling it a national monument. it was never intended for those purposes. that is why we should have ended-- well, actually, it had ended the program that allowed billions of dollars to be accumulated and spent buying more and more land for the government to control. {time} 2000 it is very difficult in my district. it is not like the federal government owns one big swath of land. it can surround private property and make the lives of private property owners miserable, make it unbearable, being a horrible neighbor. even if the federal government doesn't own the private property, they can make usage of that property very unpleasant. is it any wonder right now in america that donald trump is leading in the republican primary in so many of the polls?

JASON CHAFFETZ of utah in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an Olympic gold medalist, pioneering athlete and legendary skiing ambassador who had an immeasurable impact on the sport and on the State of Utah. Stein Eriksen passed away December 27 at the age of 88 following a long and storied career. For 35 years, Eriksen served as the Director of Skiing at Utah's famed Deer Valley Resort, where the renowned Stein Eriksen Lodge was named in his honor. His ski career began in 1947 when the 19-year-old Norwegian athlete won the downhill and combination event at the Holmenkollen Kandahar event. At the 1952 Oslo Olympics in his hometown, Eriksen became the first skier from a non-Alpine country to win an Olympic gold medal in Alpine skiing. Most significantly, Eriksen was the first man to win three gold medals in a single world championship in 1954. Upon his retirement from competitive skiing in 1954, Eriksen continued to shape the sport as a ski instructor and promoter of a new style of skiing. His elegant technique and gymnastic movements were transformative for the skiing world, ushering in a new era of freestyle skiing. He was the first well-known skier to do a flip on skis and reportedly did a back flip every day until he reached his 80s. Eriksen was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Utah Sports Commission in April, where he was lauded as one of the most influential athletes and businessmen in winter sports. Eriksen and his wife Francoise were the parents of 5 children. Today, I ask all Members of Congress to join me as we honor the life and legacy of skiing pioneer Stein Eriksen, whose indelible impact on winter sports will be felt by many generations to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E3] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO STEIN ERIKSEN ______ HON.

She started her career as a Capitol police officer. Later, she became the Republican supervisor of the House page program, a position she held for 25 years. In that time, she was beloved by the pages who worked for her. Today, there are hundreds of former pages all over the world who still keep in touch. I learned a lot from my mentors when I was starting out. I know the meaning they have in young people's lives. For hundreds of young people, Peggy was that mentor. And for the dozens of people she worked with every day, she was a great friend. In 2011, she became a floor operations clerk and has been there ever since. Ask any of her colleagues, and they will tell you she was completely reliable. It did not matter if you were a high-ranking member of Congress or a fresh-faced intern, everyone could depend on her for everything you could think of: a piece of candy, band aids, Tylenol. And in a pinch, she could sew a mean button. In short, she was a delight to work with--very kind and generous. We will miss her dearly. And so, on behalf of the entire House, I want to thank Peggy Sampson for reminding us, through her work, of the joy of public service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E3] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING PEGGY SAMPSON _____ HON.

PAUL D. RYAN of wisconsin in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Peggy Sampson on her retirement after 37 years of working for the House. She has dedicated her life to public service. She started her career as a Capitol police officer. Later, she became the Republican supervisor of the House page program, a position she held for 25 years. In that time, she was beloved by the pages who worked for her. Today, there are hundreds of former pages all over the world who still keep in touch. I learned a lot from my mentors when I was starting out. I know the meaning they have in young people's lives. For hundreds of young people, Peggy was that mentor. And for the dozens of people she worked with every day, she was a great friend. In 2011, she became a floor operations clerk and has been there ever since. Ask any of her colleagues, and they will tell you she was completely reliable. It did not matter if you were a high-ranking member of Congress or a fresh-faced intern, everyone could depend on her for everything you could think of: a piece of candy, band aids, Tylenol. And in a pinch, she could sew a mean button. In short, she was a delight to work with--very kind and generous. We will miss her dearly.

TIM RYAN of ohio in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Salvatore ``Sam'' Traficanti. Born on August 11th, 1928, in Marane, province de L'Aquila, Abruzzi, Italy, Sam was the son of Panfilo and Incornada (Centofanti) Traficanti. At the age of eight years old, Sam, along with his mother, took the journey from Italy and came to Ellis Island. Upon moving to America Sam and his family settled in Struthers and then later moved to Poland, Ohio. Sam attended Struthers High School and enlisted in the U.S. Navy on May 14, 1946, to serve and defend our country aboard Aircraft Carrier, USS Midway. He earned the rank of third class petty officer and during World War II was an interpreter for American forces in Naples, Italy. While aboard the USS Midway, Sam served as an electrician and was a Motion Picture operator. Sam was awarded the World War II Victory Medal and the Good Conduct Medal for his service and then received an honorable discharge on March 24, 1948. After his discharge from the service, Sam was employed at Youngstown Cartridge. He then owned and operated two city service gas stations in the Struthers area, along with founding one of the largest trucking companies within the industry, which was Traficanti Trucking for many years. As always, with his entrepreneurial spirit, Sam looked to continue to grow and became co-owner and partner of B & T Express Inc. which operates in over 48 states. Sam leaves behind his wife of over 52 years, the former Barbara Ann Jenness, whom he married on May 29, 1963; a son, Commissioner Anthony T. Traficanti; and a daughter, Jacqueline Ann Traficanti, both of Poland. Besides his parents, Sam was preceded in death by a brother, Tony Traficanti; and his uncles, Atillio (Joann), Serfino and Lorenzo Centofanti. Sam lived the American Dream in every way imaginable. His entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to service not only strengthened Northeast Ohio, but the entire country. Sam will be missed, but I, along with the rest of our community, remain thankful for his many contributions. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E3] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF SALVATORE ``SAM'' TRAFICANTI ______ HON.

JEFF MILLER of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise today to recognize the life and service of my friend, Northwest Florida's beloved William Earl ``Gator'' Farrington. Throughout his long and distinguished life, Gator was a devoted family man, a patriotic veteran, committed community leader, successful small businessman, and a true friend. The entire Northwest Florida community mourns the passing of a truly remarkable man. Earl Farrington was born on Tuesday, April 5th, 1927. He and his twin sister, Earline, were the youngest of three children born to James and Laura Farrington. During his formative years, Earl was spotted at the tender age of thirteen dragging from a lake a five-foot alligator he had shot. He was dubbed ``Gator'' on the spot and being somewhat of a comedian ``Gator'' has worn his nickname with great joviality, good cheer, and eternal optimism. Gator graduated from Milton High School in 1944 and served in World War II and the Korean War in the U.S. Navy. After 30 years he retired from civil service at NAS Pensacola in 1984. He was one of the founding members of Grace Bible Church of Milton and served on the board of directors of Gospel Projects, Inc. Gator is preceded in death by his wife of 52 years, Voncille (Hobbs) Farrington; his two sisters, Louise McLellan and Earline Tompkins; and his parents, James Farrington and Laura (Broxson) Farrington. Gator loved serving his community with his family through his restaurant, Gator's Seafood in Milton, Florida, which he opened in 1975, with Voncille. The rustic building known as Gator's was constructed from juniper logs felled by Gator and his then 75-year-old father off their land, floated by the two across the lake, and cut into lumber by a small sawmill. Gator's quickly became popular for its fresh seafood, family friendly environment, and impeccable service. The restaurant has become world famous for its fresh and perfectly prepared fried mullet, which many in Northwest Florida consider a delicacy. The summer months attracted large crowds to the restaurant on Friday and Saturday nights, not only for the fried mullet and catfish, crab claws, cheese grits, cole slaw and [[Page E4]] hushpuppies, but for the special brand of humor and entertainment Gator brought to each and every family that walked through the door. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I am proud to recognize the life and legacy of William Earl ``Gator'' Farrington. My wife Vicki and I extend our deepest prayers and condolences to his daughter, Lisa Jeffers; his son, William E. ``Bill'' Farrington, II; his four grandchildren, Jeffrey Bennett, Brandon Bennett, Zachary Farrington, and Abigail Farrington; two great-grandchildren, Allie Jae Bennett and Troy Bennett; and the entire Farrington family. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E3-E4] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND DEDICATED SERVICE OF WILLIAM EARL ``GATOR'' FARRINGTON ______ HON.

The Cougars were coached by Tom Herman and led by star quarterback, Greg Ward Jr., who dazzled a national television audience by running for two touchdowns and throwing for another touchdown. Greg Ward Jr. also made history by becoming the first player in UH history to run and throw for 1,000 yards in a season. Florida State trailed 21-3 at halftime, tried to rally with two fourth-quarter touchdowns but it was not enough to overcome the mighty Cougars defense, which held the Seminoles' star running back, Dalvin Cook, to just 33 yards and forced 5 turnovers. The 38 points scored by the Cougar offense was the most points allowed this season by the mighty Seminole defense.

DOUG LAMBORN of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing which recently celebrated its 10 year anniversary in November 2015. The National Coordination Office, also known as the NCO, was established by a presidential directive under President George W. Bush. That directive provided guidance to government agencies on the management of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and other space-based Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) systems. It also established the National Executive Committee (EXCOM) for Space-Based PNT, which is chaired jointly by the Deputy Secretaries of Defense and Transportation and includes their equivalents from the Departments of State, the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and Homeland Security, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The NCO is a cadre of senior advisors from the EXCOM member agencies and has become a linchpin for national GPS policy information. Earlier this year I worked with the NCO at a Space Power Caucus event on GPS. As chairman of the caucus, I presided over this event and was impressed by the educational information on how GPS works, how it affects our daily lives and critical infrastructure, and ongoing government efforts to maintain GPS as the ``gold standard'' for PNT around the world. The transparent operations of the NCO keep track of these vital efforts and inform the EXCOM agencies, Congress, and the public on Space-based PNT. The NCO facilitates the implementation of EXCOM tasks and disseminates information about U.S. space-based PNT programs and policy through the official government GPS website at www.gps.gov. The Department of Commerce and its Office of Space Commerce have hosted the NCO since 2005. This longstanding relationship was recently codified in law through the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, signed November 25, 2015. In ten years, the NCO evolved from an idea into an essential organization with significant impact within the space-based PNT community. NCO efforts ensure the EXCOM is an effective body for assisting national leaders in implementing national Space-based PNT policy. In closing Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge this organization on this milestone, and congratulate them on ten years of hard work and wish them continued success in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E4] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL COORDINATION OFFICE FOR SPACE-BASED POSITIONING, NAVIGATION, AND TIMING CELEBRATES 10 YEARS OF SERVICE _____ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sadness and a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to Natalie Cole, a woman who touched the hearts of millions of Americans. Natalie Cole passed away, December 31, 2015 in Los Angeles, California; she was only 65 years old. Natalie Cole's musical career began in 1975 when her debut album, Inseparable, was released and she became an instant star in the music industry. With hit songs such as ``This Will Be (An Everlasting Love),'' Natalie Cole exploded onto the music scene, earning the young starlet her first two Grammy Awards--for best new artist and best female R&B performance. In 1976 not long after Inseparable was released Cole married producer Marvin Yancy, with whom she welcomed her son Robert Adam Yancy into the world. Natalie Cole's career began to climb to new heights throughout the 1970's, releasing four gold and two platinum records. In 1979, Natalie Cole was honored on the Hollywood walk of fame, with a star of her very own. Although this strong woman struggled with her own personal demons, she was able to face and overcome them and in the mid-1980's was back on top of the musical charts with the megahit, ``Pink Cadillac.'' In 1991, Natalie Cole released her career-defining Unforgettable . . . with Love, which paid tribute to her beloved father, the legendary and inimitable Nat King Cole. Unforgettable sold more than 7 million copies and garnered several honors, including the coveted Grammy for Album of the Year. Natalie Cole continued to release many other popular albums, including Snowfall on the Sahara and The Magic of Christmas, an album of holiday standards recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Speaker, truer words were never spoken than when Natalie Cole's family said that ``Natalie fought a fierce, courageous battle, dying how she lived . . . with dignity, strength and honor.'' Natalie Cole leaves behind a legacy as one of the most celebrated recording artists in history. I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Natalie Cole who will forever remain Unforgettable in the hearts of her legions of fans around the world. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E5] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MOURNING THE LOSS AND HONORING THE UNFORGETTABLE LIFE OF NATALIE COLE _____ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sadness and a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to Natalie Cole, a woman who touched the hearts of millions of Americans. Natalie Cole passed away, December 31, 2015 in Los Angeles, California; she was only 65 years old. Natalie Cole's musical career began in 1975 when her debut album, Inseparable, was released and she became an instant star in the music industry. With hit songs such as ``This Will Be (An Everlasting Love),'' Natalie Cole exploded onto the music scene, earning the young starlet her first two Grammy Awards--for best new artist and best female R&B performance. In 1976 not long after Inseparable was released Cole married producer Marvin Yancy, with whom she welcomed her son Robert Adam Yancy into the world. Natalie Cole's career began to climb to new heights throughout the 1970's, releasing four gold and two platinum records. In 1979, Natalie Cole was honored on the Hollywood walk of fame, with a star of her very own. Although this strong woman struggled with her own personal demons, she was able to face and overcome them and in the mid-1980's was back on top of the musical charts with the megahit, ``Pink Cadillac.'' In 1991, Natalie Cole released her career-defining Unforgettable . . . with Love, which paid tribute to her beloved father, the legendary and inimitable Nat King Cole. Unforgettable sold more than 7 million copies and garnered several honors, including the coveted Grammy for Album of the Year. Natalie Cole continued to release many other popular albums, including Snowfall on the Sahara and The Magic of Christmas, an album of holiday standards recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra.

CREC-2016-01-05-pt1-PgE4-5,CREC-2016-01-05,114,IN MEMORY OF MARILYN COY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E4-E5] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF MARILYN COY _____ HON. JOE WILSON of south carolina in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on Christmas Day, South Carolina lost one of its most dynamic citizens with the death of Marilyn Coy. Marilyn was symbolic of a political revolution of people moving as transplants from the Midwest and Northeast to the South, developing a two party system with Republicans growing from nonexistence to achieving a super-majority. The following tribute was published in The State newspaper of Columbia on December 27, 2015: Marilyn Sue Coy, wife of Calvin Coy, left this earth for Heaven while at home on Friday, December 25, 2015, on the day we celebrate our Lord's birthday, Christmas. She was 83. Viewing and family visitation will be on Tuesday, December 29, 2015, from 6 to 8 pm at Caughman-Harman Funeral Home-- Chapin Chapel, 123 Columbia Ave, Chapin, SC 29036. Services will be held on Wednesday, December 30, 2015, at 11 am at Chapin United Methodist Church, 415 Lexington Ave, Chapin, SC 29036. Interment to follow at Fort Jackson National Cemetery, 4170 Percival Rd, Columbia, SC 29229. Born in Lake Cicott, Indiana, on May 11, 1932, to the late Horace and Suzie Julian, Marilyn Coy was preceded by her son Mark, her sister Norma Franzen, and her grandson Gabriel Coy. After 62 years of marriage, Marilyn leaves behind her husband Cal Coy, her daughter Laura Pike of Montauroux, France, and her son Bruce and wife Pamela Coy of Summerville, SC. She also leaves behind five grandchildren Jamie Pike, Alexia Pike and Caroline Pike of France, and Julian Coy and Carra and her husband Jesse Beam of South Carolina, and one great grandson, ``baby Jack,'' son of Alexia Pike and Fabien Scrivo of France. Marilyn was an active member of every community where she lived. Her outspoken personality and drive has had a positive impact on every life she touched from immediate family, to friends, organizations and even the state of South Carolina which she loved so dearly. Marilyn and her husband Cal moved to Irmo, South Carolina in 1969 and [[Page E5]] then to the Chapin community, living on Lake Murray since 1972. Long after moving to South Carolina, Marilyn learned that she was a direct descendant of the St. Julian's--French Huguenot settlers who came to the coast of South Carolina in the 1690's, first cousins to the Ravenels. A branch of the St. Julian family moved to Indiana, and dropped the prefix ``St.'' from which Marilyn is directly descendant, her maiden name being ``Julian.'' Although this fact was learned by Marilyn late in her life, it validated her immense love and connection to the state of South Carolina. Among the many organizations that she freely gave her time and passions to, the following were some of her most cherished activities, in no particular chronology or preference. Marilyn absolutely loved being a Docent at the South Carolina Governor's mansion. She began doing this during the administration of the late Governor Carroll and Iris Campbell and continued this activity under many governors of both parties. Although inactive for several years, Marilyn remained on the Docent rolls until her passing. Marilyn was a member of Clemson University Extension's Town & Country Homemakers. She was a member and former president of the Evergreen Garden Club. She was a life member of the Eastern Star of Ohio, and a very proud member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. To say Marilyn was an avid reader is an understatement, devouring and collecting books of all sorts. She feasted on knowledge, always fresh with the news and sharp on history. From her early South Carolina years as a member of the Dutch Fork Republican Women's Club, many in the community knew Marilyn as a staunch political operative, with a passion and drive that helped many candidates reach their elected goals. As a testimony to this passion, Marilyn was a founding member of the Joe Wilson for State Senate Committee and a delegate to the State Republican convention for nearly 20 years. Marilyn and her sharp wit thoroughly enjoyed an active social life as a member of the Chapin Hat Ladies, and as a charter member of the Carolinian Society where she cherished attending the annual ball. As a founding organizational member of the Chapin Community Theatre group, Marilyn also enjoyed nurturing and sharing her artistic talents with her paintings and by helping organize the Chapin Arts & Crafts Club. She loved to cook and to entertain, serving as host to many parties and events, including having her Bridge club at her home on many occasions. Whether for fun, or as a political forum for the candidates that she supported, Marilyn helped organize the first Chapin Labor Day Festival and Parade. Her family believes both reasons to be true. Marilyn was a member of the American Legion Auxiliary at Chapin Post 193, and she loved being a member of the Chapin United Methodist Church and was so thankful for all the ministerial support the Church had extended during her lengthy illness. Marilyn loved and supported her husband, family and friends fiercely and selflessly, as an encouraging force behind others, never taking the spotlight for herself. Her compassion for others and charitable sacrifices will never be forgotten, and her faith in Jesus Christ places her in the Glory of Heaven with those that went before her, and with those who will follow. For all of those who knew Marilyn, the birthday party for our Lord Jesus in Heaven must have been a little livelier with Marilyn arriving on the day that we celebrate His birth, Christmas. A gift for Heaven for eternity, and a remembrance of the gift that she was to all of us who knew her here on this earth. In lieu of flowers, the family requests for donations to made in her honor to the Chapin United Methodist Church building fund, or the American Legion post 193 building fund, or the charity of their choice. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E4-E5] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF MARILYN COY _____ HON.

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise on the first Restoration Tuesday of the session to reiterate the ongoing and urgent need to protect the voting rights of all Americans. On behalf of the constituents we were sent here to represent, we must leave our inaction on voting rights behind in 2015! Now is the time to Restore the Vote! It is completely unacceptable that this upcoming election in November will be our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This Congress has had over two years to answer the Supreme Court's call to develop a modern day formula for preclearance. We should be embarrassed by our inaction. It is past time for this body to Restore the Vote! Far too many of our constituents will face new barriers to voting this year. From African American communities in my home state of Alabama, to Native American communities in Alaska, to Asian American communities in California and Latino communities in Texas, thousands of minority communities across America will be met with modern-day barriers to the ballot box due to our inaction. Any attempt to restrict a certain portion of our electorate is a threat to our democracy, whether that is through voter ID laws, the closure of driver's license offices, or the scaling back of early voting. While these don't appear as egregious as literacy tests and poll taxes, they represent modern- day attempts to achieve the same goal--to restrict the vote of a portion of the electorate. This is a very old strategy used by individuals in our democracy who wish to silence the voices of entire groups of people. Because of the Voting Rights Act, approximately 3,000 discriminatory voting changes were blocked from occurring from 1965 to 2013. In 1970, when the law was expanded to abolish literacy tests and lower the voting age to 18, the impact was significant as 9 million new voters were added to the roles. As caretakers of our democracy, it is our shared responsibility to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I urge my colleagues to stand with me and renew our commitment towards voter equality. We must pass the Voting [[Page E6]] Rights Advancement Act and help ensure equal access to the ballot box for every American. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E5-E6] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REITERATING THE NEED TO RESTORE THE VOTE IN 2016 _____ HON.

Because of the Voting Rights Act, approximately 3,000 discriminatory voting changes were blocked from occurring from 1965 to 2013. In 1970, when the law was expanded to abolish literacy tests and lower the voting age to 18, the impact was significant as 9 million new voters were added to the roles.

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise on the first Restoration Tuesday of the session to reiterate the ongoing and urgent need to protect the voting rights of all Americans. On behalf of the constituents we were sent here to represent, we must leave our inaction on voting rights behind in 2015! Now is the time to Restore the Vote! It is completely unacceptable that this upcoming election in November will be our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This Congress has had over two years to answer the Supreme Court's call to develop a modern day formula for preclearance. We should be embarrassed by our inaction.

DAN NEWHOUSE of washington in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer congratulations to four high school teams that continue to establish Central Washington as the football powerhouse of Washington State. On December 5, (13-1) the Prosser High School Mustangs rolled over the Tumwater Thunderbirds to claim the Washington State 2A High School Football Championship. Led by a stellar defense, the Mustangs amassed four interceptions for the third time in the playoffs. This is Prosser's fifth state football championship. Not to be outdone, the (13-1) Okanogan High School Bulldogs pulled off an amazing, nail-bitter win that you usually only see in the movies. Rallying from a 27-14 third quarter deficit, the Bulldogs pulled off a late-fourth quarter touchdown to defeat the Napavine Tigers 36-34. This was Okanogan's second straight Washington State 2B High School Football Championship. Central Washington teams proved very successful in other divisions as well. In a Knights versus Knights face-off, the Royal High School Knights defeated the Kings' High School Knights in the Washington State 1A High School Championship. The win secured Royal's perfect (14-0) season, their first championship since 2007, and the school's fifth title. Particularly commendable is Royal's defense, which allowed a mere four and a half points average scored against the team throughout the season. Finally, in another nerve-wracking finale, the (13-1) Almira Coulee Hartline High School Warriors edged out Lummi Nation Blackhawks 46-42 for the Washington State 1B High School Football title. Almira Coulee Hartline entered the fourth quarter down 42-38, but after recovering a Lummi fumble on the one yard line, the Warriors began a 99 yard drive that ended with a three yard touchdown with just a minute and a half left on the clock. This was also Almira Coulee Hartline's first title since 2007, and the school's third state championship. Every one of these teams has proudly represented their school. These teams have demonstrated the level of skill, teamwork, and tenacity that will prepare them well for future seasons and for future success in life. Congratulations to Prosser, Okanogan, Royal, and Almira Coulee Hartling on a well-played football season. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E6] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CENTRAL WASHINGTON STATE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS _____ HON.

JOHN L. MICA of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Peter Gold--an exceptional young man and Good Samaritan who recently made a remarkably selfless and heroic decision to help another in need, putting his own safety at great risk. While driving through New Orleans' Lower Garden District following his shift at a local hospital, Peter, a fourth year medical student at Tulane University, without regard for his own safety, rushed to the aid of a woman being attacked. Successfully foiling the crime, Peter was shot once in the abdomen before the perpetrator attempted to shoot him in the head twice with his gun jamming. A surveillance camera recorded the harrowing event. Its release, which millions have viewed, has been an inspiration, giving us hope as we face the realities of Edmund Burke's famous words, ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'' Coming from a family with a rich history of service in the health care field, Peter chose to follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. Like those who have come before him and those who will succeed him, Peter exemplifies the commitment to service that drives so many toward the health care profession and that was on display in the early morning hours of November 20, 2015 as Peter intervened to stop an armed robbery and attempted kidnapping. I am honored to share this story with you today because the Gold Family resides in our Seventh Congressional District. Peter grew up in Longwood, Florida and is a graduate of Central Florida's own Lake Brantley High School. He is an outstanding testament to our community's and our nation's youth. Our former President John Quincy Adams said, ``If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.'' Truly, Peter Gold has inspired others through his heroic actions. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and thanking Peter for his courageous act for the benefit for another human being. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E6] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A TRIBUTE TO PETER GOLD _____ HON.

CREC-2016-01-05-pt1-PgE6-4,CREC-2016-01-05,114,HONORING WALTER HAZLITT FOR SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY AND COMMUNITY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E6] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING WALTER HAZLITT FOR SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY AND COMMUNITY _____ HON. LEE M. ZELDIN of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the service of Walter Hazlitt. It takes a special type of person to lead a life serving both country and community; Mr. Hazlitt is an example of this type of person. Mr. Hazlitt served as a Sergeant for three years in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Marine theatre in China where he selflessly protected our country during World War II. Following his service in the Marines, Mr. Hazlitt continued to serve his country and community, working diligently and tirelessly as both a Suffolk County Legislator and as a member of the Stony Brook Fire Department for fifty-five years, where he served as Chief and continues to serve today as Commissioner. In addition to the aforementioned, Mr. Hazlitt served as a member on the Board of Trustees at Suffolk Community College, dedicating his time to ensure that local youth on Long Island achieved the best education possible. Mr. Hazlitt currently resides in Stony Brook, NY and is married to Mrs. Elizabeth Hazlitt. His daughter, Elizabeth Emerson, has followed in her father's footsteps of public service by serving as a New York State Supreme Court Justice.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform the House of an ongoing problem in the former CIS countries involving the banking industry that requires the attention of the Congress and the Administration. In the aftermath of 9/11 the United States took decisive action to implement stronger financial controls to disrupt, impede, and prevent the flow of funds to terrorists around the world. But recent events indicate the need for sustained vigilance and additional action. One example of this involves the countries of Moldova and Latvia, two members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) formed in 1991 upon the dissolution of the former Soviet Union in 1991. In Moldova more than $1 billion was stolen from the Moldovan national treasury and a large portion of that money appears to have ended up in three EU banks in Latvia: ``ABLV, Latvijas Pasta Banka, and Privatbank.'' Mr. Speaker, these banks appear to be financial institutions controlled by associates and friends of Russian President Vladimir Putin who have a demonstrated history of plundering the national treasuries of the former CIS countries.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 5, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill to permit commercial filming and photography on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, east of Union Square, the only area where such filming is currently authorized. This bill would permit commercial photography and filming outside of the Capitol and congressional office buildings by permit, so long as both the House and Senate are not in session. In today's world, where many societies are facing upheavals, our country should be the first to encourage commercial photography and filming of the Capitol, which symbolizes U.S. democracy at work. Hollywood and other commercial filmmakers should not have to go to other or fake capitol buildings for movies and films about the U.S. Capitol. The current policy permitting filming near the United States Botanic Garden shows that the Capitol police can handle filmmaking on Capitol grounds, especially when Congress is not in session. However, filming from that vantage point captures the least familiar view of the Capitol. At a time when the reputation of Congress is particularly low, filming of the Capitol, a building that represents American democracy, could bolster its image. Keeping filmmakers from standing in front of the Capitol is neither business-friendly nor true to the nation's democratic traditions. Encouraging commercial photography and filming at the Capitol would help spread the story of our national legislature around the world. The time is overdue to allow to commercial filming and photography of the exterior of the historic 19th century Capitol building. There is no good reason why commercial filming and photography should be confined to Union Square. Specifically, my bill gives the Capitol Police the discretion, depending on the circumstances in and around the Capitol, to issue a permit authorizing commercial filming and photography under the same conditions as those in Union Square. Such areas might include, for example, Independence Avenue on the House side and Constitution Avenue on the Senate side. No policy or security reason exists to justify limiting commercial filming and photography of the Capitol complex to only one location, Union Square, particularly considering that permits are necessary. People are regularly seen on East Capitol Street (east of 2nd Street) taking pictures, where they get a full view of the Capitol building, demonstrating how arbitrary it is to limit commercial filming to Union Square. Capitol Police would also have authority to charge a fee to cover any costs incurred by the Architect of the Capitol as a result of the issuance of the permit, to be deposited into the Capitol Trust Account. The Capitol Trust Account was established to accept proceeds from any fees collected for commercial filming permits for Union Square. Amounts in the Capitol Trust Account would be available without fiscal year limitation for such maintenance, improvements, and projects with respect to the Capitol grounds as the Architect of the Capitol considers appropriate, subject to the approval of the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate. Views of the U.S. Capitol are among America's most iconic. Limiting commercial filming and photography of the Capitol, an important vehicle for telling the nation's story, does not serve the American people. Indeed, most of the world knows our country and reveres our system of government largely through commercial photography and films of the Capitol, which symbolizes our democracy at work. Commercial films and photographs of the Capitol, the seat of our democracy, are perhaps the best modern vehicles for telling the nation's story and showcasing its democratic system of government. My bill would enable appropriate, permitted commercial filming and photography of the Capitol, and would create economic benefits for the nation, the city, and private business. I urge support of this bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 2 (Tuesday, January 5, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E7] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PERMIT COMMERCIAL FILMING AND PHOTOGRAPHY ON THE GROUNDS OF THE U.S. CAPITOL _____ HON.

This bill would permit commercial photography and filming outside of the Capitol and congressional office buildings by permit, so long as both the House and Senate are not in session. In today's world, where many societies are facing upheavals, our country should be the first to encourage commercial photography and filming of the Capitol, which symbolizes U.S. democracy at work. Hollywood and other commercial filmmakers should not have to go to other or fake capitol buildings for movies and films about the U.S. Capitol. The current policy permitting filming near the United States Botanic Garden shows that the Capitol police can handle filmmaking on Capitol grounds, especially when Congress is not in session. However, filming from that vantage point captures the least familiar view of the Capitol. At a time when the reputation of Congress is particularly low, filming of the Capitol, a building that represents American democracy, could bolster its image. Keeping filmmakers from standing in front of the Capitol is neither business-friendly nor true to the nation's democratic traditions. Encouraging commercial photography and filming at the Capitol would help spread the story of our national legislature around the world. The time is overdue to allow to commercial filming and photography of the exterior of the historic 19th century Capitol building. There is no good reason why commercial filming and photography should be confined to Union Square. Specifically, my bill gives the Capitol Police the discretion, depending on the circumstances in and around the Capitol, to issue a permit authorizing commercial filming and photography under the same conditions as those in Union Square. Such areas might include, for example, Independence Avenue on the House side and Constitution Avenue on the Senate side. No policy or security reason exists to justify limiting commercial filming and photography of the Capitol complex to only one location, Union Square, particularly considering that permits are necessary. People are regularly seen on East Capitol Street (east of 2nd Street) taking pictures, where they get a full view of the Capitol building, demonstrating how arbitrary it is to limit commercial filming to Union Square. Capitol Police would also have authority to charge a fee to cover any costs incurred by the Architect of the Capitol as a result of the issuance of the permit, to be deposited into the Capitol Trust Account. The Capitol Trust Account was established to accept proceeds from any fees collected for commercial filming permits for Union Square. Amounts in the Capitol Trust Account would be available without fiscal year limitation for such maintenance, improvements, and projects with respect to the Capitol grounds as the Architect of the Capitol considers appropriate, subject to the approval of the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate. Views of the U.S. Capitol are among America's most iconic. Limiting commercial filming and photography of the Capitol, an important vehicle for telling the nation's story, does not serve the American people. Indeed, most of the world knows our country and reveres our system of government largely through commercial photography and films of the Capitol, which symbolizes our democracy at work. Commercial films and photographs of the Capitol, the seat of our democracy, are perhaps the best modern vehicles for telling the nation's story and showcasing its democratic system of government. My bill would enable appropriate, permitted commercial filming and photography of the Capitol, and would create economic benefits for the nation, the city, and private business. I urge support of this bill. ____________________",package_114_261.csv,4349,4349,4417,"[congressional record volume 162, number 2 (tuesday, january 5, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e7] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] introduction of a bill to permit commercial filming and photography on the grounds of the u.s. capitol _____ hon. eleanor holmes norton of the district of columbia in the house of representatives tuesday, january 5, 2016 ms. norton. mr. speaker, today, i introduce a bill to permit commercial filming and photography on the grounds of the u.s. capitol, east of union square, the only area where such filming is currently authorized. this bill would permit commercial photography and filming outside of the capitol and congressional office buildings by permit, so long as both the house and senate are not in session. in today's world, where many societies are facing upheavals, our country should be the first to encourage commercial photography and filming of the capitol, which symbolizes u.s. democracy at work. hollywood and other commercial filmmakers should not have to go to other or fake capitol buildings for movies and films about the u.s. capitol. the current policy permitting filming near the united states botanic garden shows that the capitol police can handle filmmaking on capitol grounds, especially when congress is not in session. however, filming from that vantage point captures the least familiar view of the capitol. at a time when the reputation of congress is particularly low, filming of the capitol, a building that represents american democracy, could bolster its image. keeping filmmakers from standing in front of the capitol is neither business-friendly nor true to the nation's democratic traditions. encouraging commercial photography and filming at the capitol would help spread the story of our national legislature around the world. the time is overdue to allow to commercial filming and photography of the exterior of the historic 19th century capitol building. there is no good reason why commercial filming and photography should be confined to union square. specifically, my bill gives the capitol police the discretion, depending on the circumstances in and around the capitol, to issue a permit authorizing commercial filming and photography under the same conditions as those in union square. such areas might include, for example, independence avenue on the house side and constitution avenue on the senate side. no policy or security reason exists to justify limiting commercial filming and photography of the capitol complex to only one location, union square, particularly considering that permits are necessary. people are regularly seen on east capitol street (east of 2nd street) taking pictures, where they get a full view of the capitol building, demonstrating how arbitrary it is to limit commercial filming to union square. capitol police would also have authority to charge a fee to cover any costs incurred by the architect of the capitol as a result of the issuance of the permit, to be deposited into the capitol trust account. the capitol trust account was established to accept proceeds from any fees collected for commercial filming permits for union square. amounts in the capitol trust account would be available without fiscal year limitation for such maintenance, improvements, and projects with respect to the capitol grounds as the architect of the capitol considers appropriate, subject to the approval of the committees on appropriations of the house and senate. views of the u.s. capitol are among america's most iconic. limiting commercial filming and photography of the capitol, an important vehicle for telling the nation's story, does not serve the american people. indeed, most of the world knows our country and reveres our system of government largely through commercial photography and films of the capitol, which symbolizes our democracy at work. commercial films and photographs of the capitol, the seat of our democracy, are perhaps the best modern vehicles for telling the nation's story and showcasing its democratic system of government. my bill would enable appropriate, permitted commercial filming and photography of the capitol, and would create economic benefits for the nation, the city, and private business. i urge support of this bill. ____________________",4349
