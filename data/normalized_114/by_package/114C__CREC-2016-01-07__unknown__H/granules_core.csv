CREC-2016-01-07-pt1-PgH106-3,CREC-2016-01-07,114,HAYMARKET CAFE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H106-H107] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HAYMARKET CAFE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to share the story of the Haymarket Cafe, started by brothers Peter and David Simpson, in Northampton, Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, one of the surest signs of a vibrant local economy is a lively restaurant scene. You know a town or a region is humming economically when you have a wide variety of restaurants to choose from. It is a sign that people have enough money left over after paying all of their bills to spend on treating themselves and their families. It is a strong indication that people feel secure in the direction of the economy. But for millions of low-wage workers across the country, the story is more complicated than that, and the picture is not all that pretty. For all the economic vibrancy associated with restaurant culture--and though restaurants employ almost 1 in 10 private [[Page H107]] sector workers--restaurant workers are among the worst paid, worst treated within the economy as a whole. {time} 1015 While non-restaurant private sector workers make a median hourly wage of $18, restaurant workers earn a median hourly wage of $10, including tips. The results are predictable in that more than 16 percent of restaurant workers live below the poverty line. This picture is made even worse by how it is skewed along race and gender lines. The highest paid positions in restaurants tend to be held by men and people who are White while the lowest paid positions are typically held by women and people of color. At the bottom of the ladder are undocumented workers, who comprise over 15 percent of the restaurant workforce, more than twice the rate for non-restaurant sectors. The good news is that it doesn't have to be this way. There are forward-thinking restaurant owners who are choosing the high road, restaurants where conscious efforts are made to break down gender and ethnic divisions and that choose to pay a living wage with good benefits. If you ask them, the owners of these establishments will tell you that they choose this path because it is not only the right thing to do, but it is also the smart thing to do financially. They choose this path because it is a solid business model that improves the chances of success in a highly competitive industry. I am proud to represent one of those restaurants in my district. The Haymarket Cafe in Northampton, Massachusetts, has led the way for almost a quarter century in treating its employees with respect and in paying them a living wage. I attended an event a couple of weeks ago at the Haymarket Cafe at which the owner, Peter Simpson, announced that his restaurant was moving to a $15 per hour minimum wage and would be eliminating tips. Now, I have known Peter for a long time, and I was not surprised that he would take such a step. Peter opened the Haymarket with his brother, David, almost 25 years ago. From the beginning, they were committed to paying a fair wage and in creating a positive work environment for their employees. In talking to Peter, I realized that his decision, while it reflected his idealism, was rooted in hard-nosed business sense. You don't survive and thrive for a quarter century in the highly competitive restaurant industry, especially in a small, tight-knit community like Northampton, if your business model isn't airtight. Every decision you make has to make sense financially in order to succeed and stay competitive. The decision to go to a $15 per hour minimum wage and eliminate tips was not something Peter took lightly. He did his homework. He looked at other restaurants in other cities that had made a similar move. He talked to all of his employees. He worked closely with the Pioneer Valley Workers Center, which is leading the charge to better the lives of low-wage immigrant workers in western Massachusetts. Eliminating tips allowed Peter to make the wages between better paid waiters and less well-paid kitchen staff more equitable. It allowed his wait staff to earn a wage they could count on, rather than having to depend on the tipping whims of customers. It also gave him increased staffing flexibility, as he could train all of his staff to do all jobs so he could more easily shift people around when necessary. In committing to a $15 per hour minimum wage, Peter also increased staff loyalty while decreasing turnover and training costs. As a result of Peter's bold decision, the Haymarket Cafe has been overwhelmed by an outpouring of support. Staff and customers are equally enthusiastic, and business has jumped. This commitment to wage equity has shown, once again, to be a sound business strategy and has shown that a business based on such principles can provide a decent living for its staff and can contribute to the economic health of the community. Mr. Speaker, the Haymarket Cafe is living proof, especially in an industry with such a dismal track record on wages, that paying a living wage is good for business and that a commitment to wage equity makes financial sense. The restaurant industry can and must do better, and I am proud to say the Haymarket Cafe is leading the way. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H106-H107] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HAYMARKET CAFE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I was proud to vote in favor of the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which repeals the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA. With yesterday's passage of the bill, it marks the first time repeal of the ACA has been sent to President Obama's desk. In the past year, several significant problems with this law have become ever more clear. We have seen a large number of healthcare co- ops go under. One major healthcare provider, UnitedHealthcare, announced it is pulling out of the ACA exchange. This system is just not sustainable. Late last year, the Congressional Budget Office released a report stating that the ACA will lead to a reduction of work-hours equivalent to 2 million jobs over the next decade. The CBO attributes this reduction to healthcare subsidies tied to income, raising effective tax rates for Americans, and creating a disincentive for people seeking promotions or new, higher paying jobs. It also points to higher taxes and penalties as a reason for the reduction in work-hours. In comparison, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act will reduce the Federal deficit by more than half a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. It will also eliminate costly provisions, such as the individual and employer health insurance coverage mandates, the Cadillac tax on high-cost plans, and it will enhance the solvency of Medicare. It also ensures that Federal tax dollars will not go to providers of abortion. Mr. Speaker, over the past several years, dozens of ACA reforms have been signed into law. However, we have only scratched the surface when it comes to addressing problems with this law. It is time to come together to support a comprehensive approach that ensures responsible use of taxpayer dollars and fixes the issues affecting our Nation's healthcare system. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Page H106] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore.

One major healthcare provider, UnitedHealthcare, announced it is pulling out of the ACA exchange. This system is just not sustainable. Late last year, the Congressional Budget Office released a report stating that the ACA will lead to a reduction of work-hours equivalent to 2 million jobs over the next decade. The CBO attributes this reduction to healthcare subsidies tied to income, raising effective tax rates for Americans, and creating a disincentive for people seeking promotions or new, higher paying jobs. It also points to higher taxes and penalties as a reason for the reduction in work-hours. In comparison, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act will reduce the Federal deficit by more than half a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. It will also eliminate costly provisions, such as the individual and employer health insurance coverage mandates, the Cadillac tax on high-cost plans, and it will enhance the solvency of Medicare. It also ensures that Federal tax dollars will not go to providers of abortion. Mr. Speaker, over the past several years, dozens of ACA reforms have been signed into law. However, we have only scratched the surface when it comes to addressing problems with this law. It is time to come together to support a comprehensive approach that ensures responsible use of taxpayer dollars and fixes the issues affecting our Nation's healthcare system. ____________________",package_114_278.csv,2235,2235,2304,"[congressional record volume 162, number 4 (thursday, january 7, 2016)] [house] [page h106] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] repealing the affordable care act the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. thompson) for 5 minutes. mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, yesterday, i was proud to vote in favor of the restoring americans' healthcare freedom reconciliation act, which repeals the affordable care act, or the aca. with yesterday's passage of the bill, it marks the first time repeal of the aca has been sent to president obama's desk. in the past year, several significant problems with this law have become ever more clear. we have seen a large number of healthcare co- ops go under. one major healthcare provider, unitedhealthcare, announced it is pulling out of the aca exchange. this system is just not sustainable. late last year, the congressional budget office released a report stating that the aca will lead to a reduction of work-hours equivalent to 2 million jobs over the next decade. the cbo attributes this reduction to healthcare subsidies tied to income, raising effective tax rates for americans, and creating a disincentive for people seeking promotions or new, higher paying jobs. it also points to higher taxes and penalties as a reason for the reduction in work-hours. in comparison, the restoring americans' healthcare freedom reconciliation act will reduce the federal deficit by more than half a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. it will also eliminate costly provisions, such as the individual and employer health insurance coverage mandates, the cadillac tax on high-cost plans, and it will enhance the solvency of medicare. it also ensures that federal tax dollars will not go to providers of abortion. mr. speaker, over the past several years, dozens of aca reforms have been signed into law. however, we have only scratched the surface when it comes to addressing problems with this law. it is time to come together to support a comprehensive approach that ensures responsible use of taxpayer dollars and fixes the issues affecting our nation's healthcare system. ____________________",2235

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, with the odd drama playing out in Oregon where armed thugs have taken over a Federal wildlife facility, it is important to reflect on what the wildlife refuge system is all about. If these people had any argument with the President, it was with President Roosevelt, who 108 years ago established the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a response to protect natural resources, especially the slaughter of wild birds for feathers to adorn women's hats. It is ironic that the President, who in his younger days participated in the slaughter of over 6 million buffalo that roamed the Midwest plains on a magnificent ecostructure, realized the necessity of protecting these resources. Today we benefit from the foresight of this conservation President who provided the cornerstone of environmental protection that enriches us all. The notion that somehow this is the ``wild west,'' where people can do with public land what they want, is thoroughly discredited. This mind-set from the 1800s that there were endless, wide-open spaces, where people could do what they wished, when they wished, where they wished, is tinged with regret and tragedy. We took away the land from Native Americans that our government had given to them in solemn treaty, ratified by Congress. The mind-set that public lands of the West were to be exploited as rapidly as possible is still embodied in the Mining Act of 1872, which essentially allows anyone, including foreign mining operations, to exploit our country's mineral resources at basically no cost and with no enforceable obligation to repair the damage they inflicted. The West is now blighted with thousands of abandoned mines and oil and gas wells that will risk being a permanent scar on the landscape. While private profit was pursued, the public was left with the consequences and the cost of cleanup, if it ever occurs. The longstanding battles over American rangeland between competing owners and between competing uses, like cattle and sheep, were not pretty. There is no doubt that there are still significant problems dealing with public land management, in part because the rules of the game are still set by the Mining Act of 1872 and the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. All but the most reckless individuals would agree that if these statutes were written today they would look fundamentally different with more protections and clarity. It was into this void that Teddy Roosevelt stepped, declaring critical national monuments. He established wildlife refuges to benefit countless generations to come. These amazing treasures are not just scenic wonders. They hold extraordinarily valuable habitat for wildlife, waterfowl, helping preserve the land and the water and the ecosystem that goes far beyond what is simply spectacular to look at. This is America's heritage. We struggle on an ongoing basis to recover from the reckless, thoughtless exploitation of the last two centuries. The vast majority of the American public supports this effort, even if they never visit the remote Western regions. Indeed, the fact that they are often inaccessible is the only way that they are preserved. Imagine tour buses, motorized vehicles, hordes of tourists, their infrastructure and their litter, and the destructive effects that would have. The sideshow with the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge obscures a much larger and important public policy: protecting our heritage, enhancing it, and avoiding reckless behavior of a few that will penalize generations to come. That is why the Harney Basin Wetlands Initiative of people in that region, facilitated by the refuge between 2010 and 2013, was a textbook example of collaboration, where all the stakeholders created a vision and a 20-year plan for the refuge and the surrounding landscape, including the biggest wetland restoration project ever undertaken. It would be valuable for us to look behind the headlines to the facts on the ground, the history of the resource, the struggle for protection, the tremendous benefits for all Americans, and what the stakeholders in that region accomplished together. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Page H106] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MALHEUR NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes. Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, Washington has, once again, undermined and betrayed struggling American workers who seek jobs that pay enough to support their families. In December, on less than 72 hours' notice, Congress and President Obama shoved down the throats of Americans a 2,000-page, financially irresponsible, $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill that not only risks America's solvency, it also threatens American jobs for American workers. Under old law, 66,000 H-2B foreign worker visas could be issued each year. Buried deep inside the 2,000-page omnibus spending bill, on page 701, is an obscure provision without even a heading that, according to labor expert John Miano, increases available H-2B visas up to 264,000 per year, effectively quadrupling visas for low-skilled, temporary nonagricultural foreign workers. Making matters worse, on New Year's Eve, while America focused on football games and celebrations, President Obama issued a 200-page proposed rule to illegally bust statutory green card immigration caps by approving unlimited numbers of work permits for foreigners who don't have green cards. This White House action is yet another brazen display of contempt for immigration statutes, the rule of law, and American workers. The White House argues importing foreign labor is necessary because of a claimed shortage of American labor. Similarly, House Speaker Paul Ryan claims increasing foreign worker visas ``helps small businesses who cannot find labor when there's a surge in demand for their labor, like seafood processing or tourism.'' This claimed labor shortage is unsupported by jobs or wage data and is political bunk. Per Federal labor statistics, 57 percent--57 percent--of Americans without a high school diploma had no job in 2015's second quarter. That bears repeating. Fifty-seven percent of Americans without a high school diploma had no job in 2015's second quarter. That is a lot of Americans who would love to have those jobs President Obama and Congress denied Americans and gave to foreigners. Economics 101 explains that wages rise if there is a labor shortage and fall if there is a labor surplus. According to Census Bureau data from 2007 to 2014; wages for security guards went down 6.1 percent, for cooks down 4.4 percent; for janitors down 1.2 percent; for ushers, lobby attendants, and ticket takers, down 7.1 percent; for hotel, motel, and resort desk clerks, down 7 percent. The list of falling wages for low-income American workers goes on and on. This falling wage data is compelling evidence that there is no shortage of American labor and, to the contrary, that there is an oversupply of American labor that demands cutting foreign labor, not expanding it. Mr. Speaker, while these surges in foreign worker visas and foreign labor work permits is a huge victory for special interests that profit from suppressed wages, it is a debilitating loss for struggling American families. Unemployed and underpaid Americans desperate for a good-paying job have every right to be angry at a Federal Government that takes American jobs from American citizens and gives [[Page H106]] them to foreigners. Americans have every right to be angry at Washington elected officials who care more about special interest campaign contributions than American voters who elected us. I hope those Americans will remember their anger during 2016's primary and general elections. That is the way to force Washington to represent us. Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for anybody else, but, as for me, Mo Brooks from Alabama's Fifth Congressional District, I fight for the economic interests of American citizens and against policies that undermine the struggling American voters who sent us here.

That is part of the reason why I voted against December's financially irresponsible omnibus spending bill--and am proud of it. ____________________",package_114_278.csv,4194,4194,4263,"[congressional record volume 162, number 4 (thursday, january 7, 2016)] [house] [pages h105-h106] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] visas and work permits the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from alabama (mr. brooks) for 5 minutes. mr. brooks of alabama. mr. speaker, washington has, once again, undermined and betrayed struggling american workers who seek jobs that pay enough to support their families. in december, on less than 72 hours' notice, congress and president obama shoved down the throats of americans a 2,000-page, financially irresponsible, $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill that not only risks america's solvency, it also threatens american jobs for american workers. under old law, 66,000 h-2b foreign worker visas could be issued each year. buried deep inside the 2,000-page omnibus spending bill, on page 701, is an obscure provision without even a heading that, according to labor expert john miano, increases available h-2b visas up to 264,000 per year, effectively quadrupling visas for low-skilled, temporary nonagricultural foreign workers. making matters worse, on new year's eve, while america focused on football games and celebrations, president obama issued a 200-page proposed rule to illegally bust statutory green card immigration caps by approving unlimited numbers of work permits for foreigners who don't have green cards. this white house action is yet another brazen display of contempt for immigration statutes, the rule of law, and american workers. the white house argues importing foreign labor is necessary because of a claimed shortage of american labor. similarly, house speaker paul ryan claims increasing foreign worker visas ``helps small businesses who cannot find labor when there's a surge in demand for their labor, like seafood processing or tourism.'' this claimed labor shortage is unsupported by jobs or wage data and is political bunk. per federal labor statistics, 57 percent--57 percent--of americans without a high school diploma had no job in 2015's second quarter. that bears repeating. fifty-seven percent of americans without a high school diploma had no job in 2015's second quarter. that is a lot of americans who would love to have those jobs president obama and congress denied americans and gave to foreigners. economics 101 explains that wages rise if there is a labor shortage and fall if there is a labor surplus. according to census bureau data from 2007 to 2014; wages for security guards went down 6.1 percent, for cooks down 4.4 percent; for janitors down 1.2 percent; for ushers, lobby attendants, and ticket takers, down 7.1 percent; for hotel, motel, and resort desk clerks, down 7 percent. the list of falling wages for low-income american workers goes on and on. this falling wage data is compelling evidence that there is no shortage of american labor and, to the contrary, that there is an oversupply of american labor that demands cutting foreign labor, not expanding it. mr. speaker, while these surges in foreign worker visas and foreign labor work permits is a huge victory for special interests that profit from suppressed wages, it is a debilitating loss for struggling american families. unemployed and underpaid americans desperate for a good-paying job have every right to be angry at a federal government that takes american jobs from american citizens and gives [[page h106]] them to foreigners. americans have every right to be angry at washington elected officials who care more about special interest campaign contributions than american voters who elected us. i hope those americans will remember their anger during 2016's primary and general elections. that is the way to force washington to represent us. mr. speaker, i can't speak for anybody else, but, as for me, mo brooks from alabama's fifth congressional district, i fight for the economic interests of american citizens and against policies that undermine the struggling american voters who sent us here. that is part of the reason why i voted against december's financially irresponsible omnibus spending bill--and am proud of it. ____________________",4194
CREC-2016-01-07-pt1-PgH108-2,CREC-2016-01-07,114,NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ANNIVERSARY AND EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H108-H109] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ANNIVERSARY AND EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes. Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, Friday marks the 14th anniversary of the enactment of the No Child Left Behind legislation which, when we passed it, held so many dreams and so many aspirations for all of us because we believed that our children would get a world- class education out of that. Unfortunately, No Child Left Behind, with all its potential, fell short. So I think it is important that we all understand and we all believe in this Chamber that through education, we lift this Nation. It is probably the greatest investment that we can make in the American people. That is why, as lawmakers, we have to really work on the best policies for education, starting at the national level, because we now compete internationally, and, of course, at the State and at our local levels right at our school boards. I have been to every single school in my district in Orange County. I have [[Page H109]] met with teachers, with parents, with administrators, and with business leaders. They all had concerns with No Child Left Behind. That is why I think the recent passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation, hopefully will fix the outdated policies of that No Child Left Behind legislation. The new legislation, the new law we just passed, takes into consideration the collective criticisms of the teachers, the students, parents, administrators, business leaders, and everyone who is involved in the education of our children. The ESSA has the support of many civil rights groups, teaching groups, and community institutions. I would like to highlight a few of the improvements our parents and students can look forward to with this new law. During the No Child Left Behind era, schools were not held accountable for ensuring that the most disadvantaged students actually were aided and helped to get an education. The Every Student Succeeds Act changes this. It benefits low-income students, minority students, English language learners by requiring the schools to include student data about these groups so that we can make better policy for the accountability of how these students learn. States are also required to create exit and entrance exams for English language learners, ensuring that they will actually receive attention in these classrooms and will learn. Now, Mr. Speaker, I know that we all think that there are way too many tests in life every single day, and of course it is not the favorite part of the school day to take a test. The high-stakes testing that was under No Child Left Behind has created a lot of anxiety campuswide. Teachers felt the need to teach to the test, rather than actually teach the student that critical learning that must take place in the classroom at an early age. My mom was a teacher. She finally got out because she got tired of teaching to the test, test, test, test. She had seven kids, and they all have master's and Ph.D.s. She was a parent teacher before she went to teach in the classroom, and she knew that students learn in different ways, that not everybody learned the same way. She would work with students. Some students learn verbally, some by test-taking, others by acting out plays that get across the idea. There was no time in the classroom after No Child Left Behind. It was just one way: the test, the test, the test. I am proud to say that high-stakes testing under the new law will no longer disadvantage our schools who don't pass those tests. There are going to be other ways, including tests, to decide whether schools, teachers, and educators are doing well by our children in the classroom. Testing students will not be the end-all of what is happening in the classrooms. Schools also have the flexibility to pilot innovative testing measures, allowing more time for learning in the classroom. I am excited about this new law, Mr. Speaker, and I hope that we continue to look at it and make sure that every child has a chance in this education system. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H108-H109] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ANNIVERSARY AND EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Miami- Dade County Public Schools, where the graduation rate recently reached an all-time high of 78.1 percent for the 2014-2015 academic year, surpassing the State average of 77.8 percent. This is a 1.5 percent growth from last year's rate, marking the highest graduation rate MDCPS has achieved since the Florida Department of Education began implementing new standards to track graduation figures in the late 1990s. This is a landmark accomplishment, considering the major challenges Miami schools face, including high poverty rates and a large population of English language learners. As a former member of the Miami-Dade County School Board, I salute the students, teachers, faculty, and parents for their dedication and for their commitment to excellence. I also want to recognize School Board Chair Perla Tabares-Hantman, my other former colleagues, and Superintendent Alberto Carvalho for their exceptional leadership. I think of them frequently, and I am constantly reminded of how fortunate our community is to have them. To the entire MDCPS family, congratulations. You are a model for the Nation. I am proud to represent you. Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2015 Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on October 24, 2015, Monroe County Sheriff's Deputy Josh Gordon found himself in a firefight with a robbery suspect on Stock Island in the Florida Keys. Amidst the exchange of gunfire, Deputy Gordon's bulletproof vest stopped a round of ammunition, ultimately saving his life. If a bullet would have strayed a few inches one way or another, the outcome could have been entirely different. Every day, men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line to ensure our safety. Incidents such as this shed light on the significance of effective body armor for those who protect us. Officers like Deputy Gordon are never off duty, and we must, in turn, do everything in our power to protect them. To address this, I stand in strong support of H.R. 228, the Bulletproof Vest Grant Act of 2015, which extends the grant program for armored vests through fiscal year 2018. I strongly encourage Congress to pass this essential legislation and protect the backbone of our Nation's domestic defense. Miami International Airport Passenger Records Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miami International Airport and their record-breaking year in 2015. Forty- four million passengers passed through this world-renowned airport last year, shattering the previous annual record of 40.9 million passengers in 2014. MIA has some of the most dedicated employees in the country who ensure passengers have a pleasant experience on their journey, whether visiting relatives, conducting business, or visiting the abundance of attractions south Florida has to offer. Tens of thousands of passengers pass through MIA on a daily basis, and I am proud to recognize an airport that connects so many people throughout the world. I offer my continued support to my friend, MIA Director Emilio Gonzalez, as his team works in the new year to attract more domestic and international routes, and I know cafecitos will continue to be available at each terminal so all visiting guests can enjoy the wonderful culture of south Florida. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Page H110] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATIONS TO MIAMI-DADE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Miami- Dade County Public Schools, where the graduation rate recently reached an all-time high of 78.1 percent for the 2014-2015 academic year, surpassing the State average of 77.8 percent. This is a 1.5 percent growth from last year's rate, marking the highest graduation rate MDCPS has achieved since the Florida Department of Education began implementing new standards to track graduation figures in the late 1990s. This is a landmark accomplishment, considering the major challenges Miami schools face, including high poverty rates and a large population of English language learners. As a former member of the Miami-Dade County School Board, I salute the students, teachers, faculty, and parents for their dedication and for their commitment to excellence. I also want to recognize School Board Chair Perla Tabares-Hantman, my other former colleagues, and Superintendent Alberto Carvalho for their exceptional leadership. I think of them frequently, and I am constantly reminded of how fortunate our community is to have them. To the entire MDCPS family, congratulations. You are a model for the Nation. I am proud to represent you. Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2015 Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on October 24, 2015, Monroe County Sheriff's Deputy Josh Gordon found himself in a firefight with a robbery suspect on Stock Island in the Florida Keys. Amidst the exchange of gunfire, Deputy Gordon's bulletproof vest stopped a round of ammunition, ultimately saving his life. If a bullet would have strayed a few inches one way or another, the outcome could have been entirely different. Every day, men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line to ensure our safety. Incidents such as this shed light on the significance of effective body armor for those who protect us. Officers like Deputy Gordon are never off duty, and we must, in turn, do everything in our power to protect them. To address this, I stand in strong support of H.R. 228, the Bulletproof Vest Grant Act of 2015, which extends the grant program for armored vests through fiscal year 2018. I strongly encourage Congress to pass this essential legislation and protect the backbone of our Nation's domestic defense. Miami International Airport Passenger Records Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miami International Airport and their record-breaking year in 2015. Forty- four million passengers passed through this world-renowned airport last year, shattering the previous annual record of 40.9 million passengers in 2014. MIA has some of the most dedicated employees in the country who ensure passengers have a pleasant experience on their journey, whether visiting relatives, conducting business, or visiting the abundance of attractions south Florida has to offer.

CREC-2016-01-07-pt1-PgH108,CREC-2016-01-07,114,COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF LAWRENCE AGEE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Page H108] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF LAWRENCE AGEE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes. Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sadness to commemorate the life of Mr. Lawrence Agee, a man I call a friend. He was a long-time resident of McArthur, California, in eastern Shasta County. Born in 1937, he operated an institution in the area for 55 years, known as the Highway Garage, which was the smallest, I think, Chevrolet dealership, maybe, in the West, and it was the only one for about an 80-mile radius for a lot of years until the reorganization of General Motors happened and they took the franchise away. On that lot, he might have in his inventory seven, eight, nine new cars--pickups, mostly, for the farmers and ranchers in the area. It was really an institution to the people of the area. When that dealership was pulled, they continued on, he and his family, in providing service and towing and all of the things that you would need in that area. I got to know Lawrence when I was a new candidate in 2002, striking out from where I lived--about 2\1/2\ hours away--to go out and meet people in the vast northern California district I have represented over the years. I stopped in one day on Highway 299, in eastern Redding, right in McArthur there, and said hi to this tall, lanky fellow here, who just felt like the heart of America right there. I struck up a conversation and had a great old time. For many, many years, he did operate a Chevrolet dealership, but I drove up in my Ford. So that started a little banter going back and forth, especially if you are a partisan NASCAR fan or an automobile brand fan, which kind of tends to go with that there. One of the lines I remember him teasing me about was, ``Well, you know, it is a nice car there, but here we sell the best and service the rest.'' I guess he probably figured he was going to have to service my car a lot if I were in the neighborhood. Yet, the teasing and the banter was just one of the great parts of our friendship and relationship. Soon after that, every time I would have a chance, I would go through there, whether it was going up to the Inter-Mountain Fair for a day or two right there in town. He was a big part of that institution as well and would hang out with the people there. There is a parade at that fair each year. After I got to know him and Eleanor and his family a little bit, he even let me use his convertible to drive in the parade there. It was a neat, old Chevy SSR. I think that was his subtle way to get me into a Chevrolet at least once a year. The funny thing is that he didn't drive it that much; so, people around there would only see it once a year. And they got to thinking it was my car or something; so, it was a funny deal. That just shows his generosity and his trust. I know he was well loved in the whole community because, during fair time, he was a big, big supporter and sponsor of the fair. But I don't know if he got to go to it very often because he was always helping people with lock-outs and dead batteries or was making a tow run nearby or whatever. He was just helping keep that town together. For many of us who are in and around Shasta County there, I know he will be greatly missed. His wife, Eleanor, is a gem as well. My heart goes out to her and to the whole family there because there is really a lot happening around Highway Garage in McArthur. Again, at fair time, you would see a lot of destruction derby cars lined up at that place. His son, David, was always working on those, as were other family members. I think that is the place if you need a destruction derby car. Go see them, and they might be able to give you the best technology on that as well. In his service, he was nationally recognized as one of the best serving dealers in that dealership they had, up until 2009, when he moved on to service only and was no longer selling cars. {time} 1030 You could see it on the awards in the shop building. This big wooden building there just takes you right back to Americana from 80 years ago. I think the dealership was established in 1924. His family took over in 1949. With the passing of his father in 1959, Lawrence took over as the youngest dealer, again, in the West of a Chevrolet dealership. He was a volunteer with the McArthur Fire Department. He was a longtime leader of the Cloverleaf 4-H for over two decades. He was a member of the Fort Crook Masonic Lodge, citizen of the year at least twice, blue ribbon winner, and a longtime supporter of the Inter- Mountain Fair in many capacities. Of course, he leaves behind a legacy of what small-town America really is about. The impact he had on his community was felt not only there, but far, far away. For those people that were helped by him in the middle of the night--there maybe would be a rock in the road or something like that and if somebody would run over that, he would go out and bail them out. Indeed, one of the times when I was up for the fair and leaving town, there he was, coming up the grade in his big, yellow tow truck. That is Lawrence right there. A rewarding part of this job is getting to know people like him, and you hate it when you have to lose people like that, that are pillars in the community. Doggone it, he leaves a great legacy, and I am proud to have known him. God bless his family. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Page H108] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF LAWRENCE AGEE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support and stand with the Sikh community in the San Joaquin Valley. In the past 2 weeks, two Sikh men have been brutally attacked and, very sadly, one of them was killed. He lost his life. The Fresno City Police Department has labeled these two crimes as potential hate crimes. Amrik Singh Bal was attacked in the middle of the street while waiting for a ride so he could go to work, as any average American would do throughout our country. Gurcharan Singh Gill was killed while working at a local convenience store. Both tragic incidents took place in my district. My thoughts and prayers are with Amrik and his family, and my deepest sympathy and condolences go to the Gurcharan family for the loss. The attacks on these innocent American citizens are really an attack on all American citizens who choose to practice their religion and observe their cultural heritage, as Americans do throughout our land. Sadly, since September 11, 2001, the Sikh community has endured discrimination because of a lack of understanding of Sikhism, which is based on equality and love. They are not alone. As a nation of immigrants, we must remember, we have an opportunity to learn and benefit from the thousands of different cultures that are part of the mosaic of what makes America great. After all, we are a nation of immigrants, both past and present, and we must never ever forget that. Today, in Fresno, in spirit, we are all part of the Sikh community as we mourn these tragic incidents. Every American citizen, regardless of race, creed, or gender has the right to live free of fear and discrimination. I commend Chief Dyer and the Fresno City Police Department for working diligently to find the individual or individuals who killed Gurcharan and for continuing to look for the other individuals who are responsible for the attack on Amrik. I continue to urge the FBI and the U.S. Attorney General's office to work, as they have been, in making this investigation inquiry resolve itself, solving these very sad crimes that we [[Page H111]] think were based on hate and is truly an unfair and discriminatory situation that occurred in the last 2 weeks. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H110-H111] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VIOLENCE AGAINST SIKHS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Amrik Singh Bal was attacked in the middle of the street while waiting for a ride so he could go to work, as any average American would do throughout our country. Gurcharan Singh Gill was killed while working at a local convenience store. Both tragic incidents took place in my district. My thoughts and prayers are with Amrik and his family, and my deepest sympathy and condolences go to the Gurcharan family for the loss. The attacks on these innocent American citizens are really an attack on all American citizens who choose to practice their religion and observe their cultural heritage, as Americans do throughout our land. Sadly, since September 11, 2001, the Sikh community has endured discrimination because of a lack of understanding of Sikhism, which is based on equality and love. They are not alone. As a nation of immigrants, we must remember, we have an opportunity to learn and benefit from the thousands of different cultures that are part of the mosaic of what makes America great. After all, we are a nation of immigrants, both past and present, and we must never ever forget that. Today, in Fresno, in spirit, we are all part of the Sikh community as we mourn these tragic incidents. Every American citizen, regardless of race, creed, or gender has the right to live free of fear and discrimination. I commend Chief Dyer and the Fresno City Police Department for working diligently to find the individual or individuals who killed Gurcharan and for continuing to look for the other individuals who are responsible for the attack on Amrik. I continue to urge the FBI and the U.S. Attorney General's office to work, as they have been, in making this investigation inquiry resolve itself, solving these very sad crimes that we [[Page H111]] think were based on hate and is truly an unfair and discriminatory situation that occurred in the last 2 weeks. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H110-H111] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VIOLENCE AGAINST SIKHS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SHARON ELLIOTT-BYNUM, A TRAILBLAZER","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H107-H108] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR. SHARON ELLIOTT-BYNUM, A TRAILBLAZER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for 5 minutes. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my condolences on the passing of a giant in the Durham, North Carolina, community, a trailblazer, one who dedicated her life to improving health outcomes for disadvantaged citizens, including veterans. This trailblazer, Mr. Speaker, was my friend, Dr. Sharon Elliott- Bynum. Sharon passed away on Sunday, January 3, at the young age of 58, 2 days before her 59th birthday. We lost this giant far too soon, but not before she revolutionized the delivery of care for those in need through the founding of Durham's first free-standing, comprehensive healthcare clinic, called Healing with CAARE. My first visit as Durham's Congressman was an enlightening visit to CAARE. I saw Sharon at work, I saw paid staff, and I saw dozens of community volunteers. We mourn this tremendous loss, but we also celebrate Sharon's remarkable life, which was replete with the success that many can only hope to achieve. Born in Durham, Sharon Elliott-Bynum was a graduate of Northern High School, Durham Technical Institute, the Watts School of Nursing, and my alma mater, North Carolina Central University. She also received a master's degree and a Ph.D. from Victory International College. Sharon was a dedicated member of a great sorority, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. As a member of the Durham Alumnae Chapter, founded in 1931, she led by example. Sharon was also a member of the National Council of Negro Women, of Sigma Theta Tau International, of the Top Ladies of Distinction, and of many more service organizations. Finally, she was a faithful member of the Faith Assembly Christian Center in Durham. Dr. Elliott-Bynum was attracted to the field of nursing when she, at the age of 16, began volunteering at the historic Lincoln Community Health Center. Sharon's volunteerism motivated her to pursue a nursing career. So, in 1995, Dr. Elliott-Bynum and her late sister, Patricia-- ``Pat'' she called her--founded Healing with CAARE, Inc. What began as a nonprofit, community-based provider of services for individuals who were living with HIV expanded to being the primary healthcare home for more than 1,000 individuals who live with cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. CAARE [[Page H108]] also provides free dental care, substance abuse counseling, a food pantry, and free housing for homeless veterans. Her remarkable work has been honored over the years through many awards and recognitions. They include The Order of the Long Leaf Pine, which is the highest civilian honor presented by the Governor; the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Veterans Braintrust Award; the NCCU Distinguished Alumni Award; and the Durham Chamber of Commerce Women's Leadership Award. Dr. Elliott-Bynum's lifetime of tireless work and service to thousands of disadvantaged individuals had an immeasurable impact on the Durham community, a grateful community that joins me today in celebrating this life. I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our recognition to Dr. Sharon Elliott-Bynum's two children, Ebony Elliott-Covington and Damien Elliott-Bynum; to her beloved brother, Joe Elliott, Jr.; to her sisters, Carolyn Hinton and Addie Mann; to her grandson, Ahmad; to the entire CAARE family; and to all of those who have been impacted by her extraordinary work. Some of her family members are with us today. Mr. Speaker, in closing, on tomorrow, I will say just a few words at the Celebration of Life service in Durham by making a very plain, but profound, point. It goes like this: Durham, North Carolina, is a better place to live and work because of the unselfish service of Dr. Sharon Elliott-Bynum. May she rest in peace, a life well lived. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H107-H108] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, an interesting thing happened when President Obama was elected in 2008: We basically had a national consensus about some elements of health care. What I mean by that is, most people recognized two things about our healthcare system that were flawed. First, they recognized that it was too expensive; and, second, they recognized that people with a preexisting condition should be included and not be excluded from an insurance pool. There was a great deal of consensus around that, and that is where the opportunity was for the Obama team to bring the country together around those two core things. Instead, they did something different. Instead, they went out on a highly partisan path, and that was to create ObamaCare. We were told that the bill had to be passed in order to understand what was in it, and so forth and so on. We are familiar with the false premises and the false claims and the false narratives about it. Do you remember this? We were told that if you liked your doctor, you got to keep your doctor. If you liked your insurance coverage, you got to keep your insurance coverage. Your insurance policies, the premiums per family were going to drop by over $2,000 a year. None of that turned out to be true. None of it. People lost their coverage. People lost their physicians. Their premiums have gone up. So now what has happened, there has been this effort, and the effort over the past several years has been met by some mockery from some who have said: Hey, your efforts to repeal ObamaCare, how many times are you going to do it? Do you know how many times we are going to do it? We are going to do it until it gets done. Now it is closer than ever. I have three constituents that I want to briefly mention to you. One is a fellow that I connected with on the phone last night. His name is Jay. Jay told me that, notwithstanding the false promises of ObamaCare, his insurance premiums for him and his daughter have skyrocketed to the point where the amount of anxiety that he was communicating to me on the phone was palpable. This is not somebody who is just upset about the direction that the country has gone under this false claim of ObamaCare. He is fearful of it, and he is anxious for his future and the future of his daughter. How about Diane? My other constituent is a 9-year breast cancer survivor who was told, if you like your doctor, you get to keep your doctor, until all of a sudden, her insurance policy, after ObamaCare, kicks her physician out of the group, and she doesn't have access to the doctor that had cared for her and kept her cancer-free for 9 years. How about the small-business owner who I met with on Monday in Kane County, Illinois, who said: Congressman, we would really like to expand our business; we want to open up a new location. It was a restaurant. If we do it--and we have done the math--it is going to cost us $150,000 a year in ObamaCare payments, and we can't afford to expand. Here is what we have got to do: We have got to repeal this thing, and we have got to replace it and get back to those two core themes that say, let's deal with the underlying cost drivers in health care that make it more expensive than people can afford--and we can do that--and let's deal with the preexisting condition question. We can do that through high-risk pools and other things that don't cost the trillions of ObamaCare. Now, there is an interesting thing that has been happening, and that is this: The story of ObamaCare is shifting. You ask, well, how is it shifting? It is shifting in this way: It is shifting because we have been told that there is no way to undo this. There is no way. It is basically orthodoxy in our country. It is an entitlement, which it is, and it is so deeply embedded that it is all a fait accompli. In other words, there is no way to undo this. For a long time, that appeared to be--although it wasn't true, it appeared to be true because the Senate blocked its passage. Now, as we know, the other body has actually preceded us in this and, through the reconciliation activity, we are now able to avoid the 60-vote threshold. A simple majority of United States Senators can join with a majority of the United States House of Representatives, which I would argue is reflecting a majority of the American public, to say: Get this thing off our backs. Let us flourish. Yeah, we can deal with these things. Yes, health care needs improving, but this thing on our backs is simply smothering us. So here is the opportunity. This will be on President Obama's desk. Will he veto it? Absolutely. It is the first time it has ever gotten on his desk before. What it says is this: that there is only one office between us and the repeal of ObamaCare. One office is between us and the repeal of ObamaCare, and that office changes next November. So in 11 months, there is every opportunity for us to see its repeal and, ultimately, its replacement.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam) for 5 minutes. Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, an interesting thing happened when President Obama was elected in 2008: We basically had a national consensus about some elements of health care. What I mean by that is, most people recognized two things about our healthcare system that were flawed. First, they recognized that it was too expensive; and, second, they recognized that people with a preexisting condition should be included and not be excluded from an insurance pool. There was a great deal of consensus around that, and that is where the opportunity was for the Obama team to bring the country together around those two core things. Instead, they did something different. Instead, they went out on a highly partisan path, and that was to create ObamaCare. We were told that the bill had to be passed in order to understand what was in it, and so forth and so on. We are familiar with the false premises and the false claims and the false narratives about it. Do you remember this? We were told that if you liked your doctor, you got to keep your doctor. If you liked your insurance coverage, you got to keep your insurance coverage. Your insurance policies, the premiums per family were going to drop by over $2,000 a year. None of that turned out to be true. None of it. People lost their coverage. People lost their physicians. Their premiums have gone up. So now what has happened, there has been this effort, and the effort over the past several years has been met by some mockery from some who have said: Hey, your efforts to repeal ObamaCare, how many times are you going to do it? Do you know how many times we are going to do it? We are going to do it until it gets done. Now it is closer than ever. I have three constituents that I want to briefly mention to you. One is a fellow that I connected with on the phone last night. His name is Jay. Jay told me that, notwithstanding the false promises of ObamaCare, his insurance premiums for him and his daughter have skyrocketed to the point where the amount of anxiety that he was communicating to me on the phone was palpable. This is not somebody who is just upset about the direction that the country has gone under this false claim of ObamaCare. He is fearful of it, and he is anxious for his future and the future of his daughter. How about Diane? My other constituent is a 9-year breast cancer survivor who was told, if you like your doctor, you get to keep your doctor, until all of a sudden, her insurance policy, after ObamaCare, kicks her physician out of the group, and she doesn't have access to the doctor that had cared for her and kept her cancer-free for 9 years. How about the small-business owner who I met with on Monday in Kane County, Illinois, who said: Congressman, we would really like to expand our business; we want to open up a new location. It was a restaurant. If we do it--and we have done the math--it is going to cost us $150,000 a year in ObamaCare payments, and we can't afford to expand. Here is what we have got to do: We have got to repeal this thing, and we have got to replace it and get back to those two core themes that say, let's deal with the underlying cost drivers in health care that make it more expensive than people can afford--and we can do that--and let's deal with the preexisting condition question. We can do that through high-risk pools and other things that don't cost the trillions of ObamaCare. Now, there is an interesting thing that has been happening, and that is this: The story of ObamaCare is shifting. You ask, well, how is it shifting? It is shifting in this way: It is shifting because we have been told that there is no way to undo this. There is no way. It is basically orthodoxy in our country. It is an entitlement, which it is, and it is so deeply embedded that it is all a fait accompli. In other words, there is no way to undo this. For a long time, that appeared to be--although it wasn't true, it appeared to be true because the Senate blocked its passage. Now, as we know, the other body has actually preceded us in this and, through the reconciliation activity, we are now able to avoid the 60-vote threshold. A simple majority of United States Senators can join with a majority of the United States House of Representatives, which I would argue is reflecting a majority of the American public, to say: Get this thing off our backs. Let us flourish. Yeah, we can deal with these things. Yes, health care needs improving, but this thing on our backs is simply smothering us. So here is the opportunity. This will be on President Obama's desk. Will he veto it? Absolutely. It is the first time it has ever gotten on his desk before. What it says is this: that there is only one office between us and the repeal of ObamaCare. One office is between us and the repeal of ObamaCare, and that office changes next November. So in 11 months, there is every opportunity for us to see its repeal and, ultimately, its replacement.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Hahn) for 5 minutes. Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, this upcoming Monday, the Westboro Baptist Church plans to hold protests outside of Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California. We have seen these protests before, often at the funerals of our fallen servicemen and -women. They are known, unfortunately, for their hateful message, especially against LGBT Americans. The members of this church believe that America's generation of high schoolers is ``utterly without hope.'' They say that because these young students are promoting acceptance and inclusion of all people, regardless of whether they are gay or straight. I couldn't disagree more with their premise of calling these students ``without hope.'' I think because these students are promoting acceptance and inclusion of all people, regardless of whether they are gay or straight, they are building a future full of hope. I have the utmost faith in the next generation as the future leaders of this Nation. Of course, no matter how much I disagree with this group, these individuals should be allowed to exercise their right to protest, and they do have a right to free speech in this country. The students have those same rights, and an inspiring group of Redondo High students are organizing a peaceful counterprotest on Monday. Yesterday, I wrote a letter to the members of the school's Gay- Straight Alliance and told them that I wished I could be there on Monday to protest alongside of them. These students deserve to live in a world where they can be who they are and love whom they choose. In standing up against hate and living a life of acceptance, inclusion, and understanding, they are making that world a reality. I know my colleague here, Ted Lieu, who represents Redondo Beach, joins me in saying that we are so proud of these students. We are proud of their courage, their bravery, their intelligence, and skill in standing up for what they know is right, just, and for being brave enough to organize a counterprotest. {time} 1045 I am going to be in Washington, D.C., on Monday. But if I were not here, I would want to be standing alongside each and every student to show my solidarity with them. Instead, let me tell them that I will be there in spirit. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Page H110] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REDONDO UNION HIGH SCHOOL PROTEST The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CREC-2016-01-07-pt1-PgH112,CREC-2016-01-07,114,DO NOT LIFT SANCTIONS ON IRAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Page H112] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DO NOT LIFT SANCTIONS ON IRAN The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call on this administration to keep intact all existing sanctions on the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, Iran. Sanctions must remain, and closer scrutiny and more accountability by this administration on Iran's continuing illicit activity must occur. It is imperative for peace, security, and stability in the Middle East and across the globe that we do this. Iran's conduct over the past few months and the lack of clear and exact leadership by this administration in response is cause for serious alarm. Iran has not changed its tone and conduct since the signing of the deal. In fact, they have doubled down on their unwillingness not to comply with international agreements, and they have created more danger and instability in the process. Here is the central point why I am speaking on the House floor here today: Once we lift sanctions, we have even less leverage. So let's look at how Iran has honored their commitments in the past few months and ask ourselves: Do we anticipate Iran will conduct itself in the months and years to come better or worse? On October 10, Iran carried out a precision-guided ballistic missile test. This violates U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 and 2231. Now that Iran is prohibited from such testing under the deal, what do they do? They send weapons to Bashar al-Assad on Russian cargo planes. This violates U.N. Resolution 1747. They did that in October. On November 21, they carried out a medium-range ballistic missile test with capabilities to carry a nuclear warhead. They can't do that either. Last month, they fired several unguided rockets 1,500 yards from two U.S. vessels. Just a few days ago, they unveiled a new underground missile depot showing precision-guided missiles that have the capability to hold a nuclear warhead. What has been the response of this administration? They notify us they will respond with sanctions against Iranian individuals and businesses linked to Iran's ballistic missile program. What happened since they notified us of that? Nothing. They have walked it back. Here is my fear, Mr. Speaker. We are forecasting to Iran that they have carte blanche to do as they wish. And once we lift the sanctions, we can expect more of that. Iran is not honoring its commitments, so nor should we. We know the State Department classifies the deal not as a treaty, not as an executive agreement. It is not even a signed document. It is merely a political commitment. And it is clear Iran is not acting in good faith to our political commitment. I signed correspondence to the administration requesting that the President ``immediately void the deal and restore and/or continue all relevant sanctions on Iran that have been or will be relaxed under the JCPOA.'' Let's not concern ourselves if Iran voices outrage or condemnation that we voided a political commitment on the basis that they feel they have somehow honored the deal because, number one, they violated U.N. resolutions since the deal was signed, the Iranian Parliament refuses to ratify the deal, and the Ayatollah forbids further negotiations with the U.S. The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that Iran's U.N. violations clearly violate the spirit of our political commitment to them. Their conduct threatens our national security, it threatens the security of our allies, and it further erodes an already precarious and unstable environment in the Middle East. Iran isn't honoring its commitments, so nor should we. Let's keep the sanctions in place. Do not lift them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Page H112] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DO NOT LIFT SANCTIONS ON IRAN The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He has refused to enforce our immigration laws. He has opened the borders to Syrian migrants against the will of the American people. He has even changed the provisions of his own disastrous healthcare bill. This week, the administration once again thumbed its nose at Congress and the American people by jeopardizing the gun rights of law-abiding citizens. Mr. Speaker, the American people are fed up. The American people continue to see the executive branch not only deciding which laws they choose to enforce, but changing and interpreting the laws as they see fit. The White House has become judge, jury, and executioner, in clear violation of the principles on which this Nation was founded. Today I am introducing a resolution to censure President Barack Obama to serve as a clear rebuke and condemnation of the unconstitutional actions of this President. This is a bold measure, but is one that is necessary to preserve the very institution that we are all honored to serve: the United States Congress. The Constitution requires that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. This President has failed to do so on numerous occasions. The Constitution also requires the President to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. The President has failed to do so. Not only is the President trying to do our job, but he has failed to do his. His announced actions on gun control are just the latest example of blatant executive overreach by the President. Congress must fight back. I want to make it very clear. This is not about President Obama. This is about the actions of a President who has encroached too far on the powers of Congress. Under the Constitution, Congress is an equal branch of government and should be treated as such. We cannot roll over on every executive overreach. We cannot wait to fight next time. We cannot wait for the next President because it is not about this President or the next President. It is not about politics. It is about preserving the power of the legislative branch against this President and any future President who seeks to use egregious executive action at the expense of Congress. A resolution of censure of the President has been used rarely, but is not without precedent. It is a way for Congress to fight back against executive overreach. Censuring the President will preserve for the historical and legal record that this Congress at this time disapproves of this President's executive overreach. It is time Congress fights back as an institution.

CREC-2016-01-07-pt1-PgH111-2,CREC-2016-01-07,114,WHITE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST OIL AND GAS LEASES,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H111-H112] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WHITE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST OIL AND GAS LEASES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) for 5 minutes. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an ongoing environmental review process within my district that I firmly believe represents yet another in a long line of abuses of private property rights by the Federal Government and, more specifically, the land management agencies that oversee the majority of the land in the United States. The outcome of this process will likely set a disturbing precedent under which the integrity of contracts that the Federal Government enters into with private parties is undermined. The Bureau of Land Management is currently reviewing 65 existing oil and gas leases issued in White River National Forest beginning in 1993. This retroactive review was prompted by a 2007 decision on three of the leases by the Interior Board of Land Appeals in which the BLM was found to have not formally adopted a Forest Service environmental policy analysis that was utilized to make these leasing decisions--basically, what amounts to an administrative oversight. It should be emphasized that there are extensive environmental reviews that did, in fact, take place and that the BLM played a significant role in that process. The agency argued as much to the Board of Land Appeals during the review. The fault was simply that the BLM needed to sign on the dotted line, and the Board expressly made this option available to remedy the problem. However, instead of adopting that commonsense approach, the BLM succumbed to political pressure from the environmental extremists and determined to revisit every one of the leases issued since 1993. The new proposal from the BLM deals with leases in one of two ways. It either imposes new, significantly restrictive stipulations that were not in place at the time of the original leases when they were acquired or it outright revokes the leases. The Federal Government is acting as nothing more than a highway robber in this case and in many others, robbing citizens and businesses of property that they have bought and paid for, telling us that we should simply be grateful that there is someone looking out for our greater interests. I highlight this particular process because, should the BLM follow through with certain of its proposed actions, it will set a precedent not only for oil and gas development, but for any lessee or permittee who, in entering into a contract in good faith with a Federal agency, may see their lease or permit threatened with retroactive revocation or severely restricted based on any flimsy pretext. Many important industries rely on Federal leases and permits, including livestock grazing, recreation, and renewable energy; and no business can successfully operate if its license to do so no longer enjoys protections against arbitrary cancelations or changes, depending on the ideology of the current occupant of the White House. Numerous stakeholders and local governments recognize that the BLM's final decision would have impacts far beyond those of the specific leases in question and undertook efforts to draft detailed and substantive feedback to the agency. {time} 1100 This is a very laborious and time-consuming process. Yet the BLM provided only the bare minimum public comment during this period required by law, and the agency's scheduled comment period overlapped with Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the New Year's Day holidays. It also overlaps another environmental review comment period for the well-known Roan Plateau, which involves many of the same stakeholders and local governments and has been under review in some form since the late 1990s. As such, several stakeholders and local governments, with the support of several members of Colorado's congressional delegation, requested a modest extension of the comment period. These extension requests are routinely granted by Federal agencies in recognition of the technical nature of these issues: interruptions due to Federal holidays and when there are several similar issues under simultaneous review. Despite this, the requests in this instance were dismissed out of hand. One can only conclude that the BLM is afraid of the scrutiny that could result from them effectuating a government taking of property rights under the guise of rectifying an administrative error from over 20 years ago. It is abundantly clear that the BLM intends to ramrod through a decision that will trample on lease owners' rights by canceling or altering leases to the point as to make them economically unviable. This is, unfortunately, [[Page H112]] in line with a disturbing trend of Federal agency abuses of private property rights, whether it is the Forest Service's repeated attempts to leverage special use permits to forcibly acquire private water rights, or the EPA's determination to classify every ditch and puddle as a ``water of the United States'' to further insert itself into the everyday lives of ordinary, hardworking Americans. Property rights and the integrity of contracts are at the very foundation of our economic system, yet too often Federal agencies casually cast these important considerations aside. If the BLM is confident that it is making the right decision and is willing to defend it, then they should have no problem providing additional time for the public and other interested stakeholders to be able to comment on the proposed actions in the White River National Forest. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H111-H112] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WHITE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST OIL AND GAS LEASES The SPEAKER pro tempore.

and no business can successfully operate if its license to do so no longer enjoys protections against arbitrary cancelations or changes, depending on the ideology of the current occupant of the white house. numerous stakeholders and local governments recognize that the blm's final decision would have impacts far beyond those of the specific leases in question and undertook efforts to draft detailed and substantive feedback to the agency. {time} 1100 this is a very laborious and time-consuming process. yet the blm provided only the bare minimum public comment during this period required by law, and the agency's scheduled comment period overlapped with thanksgiving, christmas, and the new year's day holidays. it also overlaps another environmental review comment period for the well-known roan plateau, which involves many of the same stakeholders and local governments and has been under review in some form since the late 1990s. as such, several stakeholders and local governments, with the support of several members of colorado's congressional delegation, requested a modest extension of the comment period. these extension requests are routinely granted by federal agencies in recognition of the technical nature of these issues: interruptions due to federal holidays and when there are several similar issues under simultaneous review. despite this, the requests in this instance were dismissed out of hand. one can only conclude that the blm is afraid of the scrutiny that could result from them effectuating a government taking of property rights under the guise of rectifying an administrative error from over 20 years ago. it is abundantly clear that the blm intends to ramrod through a decision that will trample on lease owners' rights by canceling or altering leases to the point as to make them economically unviable. this is, unfortunately, [[page h112]] in line with a disturbing trend of federal agency abuses of private property rights, whether it is the forest service's repeated attempts to leverage special use permits to forcibly acquire private water rights, or the epa's determination to classify every ditch and puddle as a ``water of the united states'' to further insert itself into the everyday lives of ordinary, hardworking americans. property rights and the integrity of contracts are at the very foundation of our economic system, yet too often federal agencies casually cast these important considerations aside. if the blm is confident that it is making the right decision and is willing to defend it, then they should have no problem providing additional time for the public and other interested stakeholders to be able to comment on the proposed actions in the white river national forest. ____________________",5726

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) for 5 minutes. Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I want to start my time by quoting directly the Second Amendment of our Constitution: ``A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' Aren't those beautiful and resounding words? As a man who likes to keep it simple, I appreciate the Founding Fathers not only for their foresight to protect the right to bear arms, but also how plain and simple they made it. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon. Unfortunately, I think our Founding Fathers spoke too plainly for certain people and certain Presidents to understand. That President may always remind us that he taught constitutional law. Sadly, I have yet to encounter someone in that position who disregards the Constitution so regularly. Not only does that President trample on the Second Amendment, but he would also trample on Article I, which, as you know, is the Congress and going through them to make laws. That President should have known that regulations regarding buying guns must come from legislation, not by an oral decree. That President tried to legislate in the Senate several times, but his colleagues refused to do it, even though there was a majority. Now that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not in the majority in Congress, I am assuming that this administration is deciding to create their own regulations--the Constitution be damned-- because, sadly, there are no checks and balances anymore. We know even if Congress passes a bill to repeal any type of order that any President makes, it would still have to go to that individual for the bill to be signed. So what are the chances of putting together a bill that some Congress may have seen as an inappropriate action and then send it to the person that created that inappropriate action and expect him to sign it? I think, Mr. Speaker, one of the things that has so disappointed the American people is the inability to have their Representatives voice their complaints and do their legislative responsibility with an out- of-control government. So each week, as the administration or a group is intent on disregarding the Constitution, people become numb. The American people become numb to these illegal actions. I think it is time that we brought attention to some of these illegal actions that some Presidents in the past and some Presidents in the future may create. I think it is time that we bring these actions to the attention of the American people and let them know what our Founding Fathers had the intention to do originally, what they intended the Constitution to mean, and how it was interpreted by those very first legislators: President Washington, the Supreme Court, and others. They took this document as a simple document. It was very plainly written and read. But, unfortunately, we have had Supreme Courts, Presidents, and legislative bodies that have tried to take these simple, basic words and turn them into something that they could use for their benefit, to try to change the way that this world works and how the laws they make are applied to our citizens. So, Mr. Speaker, we are going to try to do as much as we can in the near future to try to bring this to the attention of the American people and the world, because I think our Constitution [[Page H113]] has been a great cornerstone for this world and for any country that wants to have a republic, a democracy, and a people-driven form of government and to really feel that coat of liberty wrapped around them. I think our Constitution is that. So I think it is time for us not only to make the citizens aware, but to make this whole world aware of what has been going on and what we are going to do to stop it. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 4 (Thursday, January 7, 2016)] [House] [Pages H112-H113] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTION ON GUNS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week The Wall Street Journal reported that the National Security Agency, the NSA, is actively spying on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of our Nation's closest allies. This revelation comes just 2 years after the President's announcement that the United States would cease spying on our allies. The Journal wrote: ``Officials said Obama insisted that keeping tabs on Netanyahu served a `compelling national security purpose.' '' Specifically, the President sought to learn about President Netanyahu's opposition to the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal. In so doing, the NSA also intercepted personal, direct communication between Members of Congress, the Prime Minister, and his staff. An editorial by The Post and Courier--republished in The Hill this week--raised important questions about the legality of the NSA's sharing private conversations with the White House and not discarding or getting judicial permission. Regrettably, this is another example of the President's disregard for our Constitution by spying on Congress, corrupting the NSA. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to the family of Staff Sergeant Matthew McClintock, an American hero. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost).

Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the team from Beiger Elementary School in Mishawaka, Indiana, for winning the 2015 FIRST LEGO League State Championship. The Beiger Bots is a team of students who was judged in three areas: a theme-based project, a robot competition, and an evaluation of core values, like teamwork. The project portion challenged the group to reduce, reuse, or recycle garbage. These students visited a local landfill and discovered that Styrofoam cutouts cannot be recycled. They brainstormed new uses for them, ultimately deciding to repurpose them as a folding breakfast tray.

(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay respect to William Wallace Sprague, Jr., who peacefully passed away last week at the age of 89. Mr. Sprague was born on November 11, 1926. He served 2 years in the United States Navy during World War II, and he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from MIT and Yale in 1950. From 1972 to 1994, he was chairman of the board and the CEO of Savannah Foods and Industries, which was the maker of Dixie Crystals sugar. Under his leadership, Savannah Foods grew from a small regional sugar refinery to a major national sugar company and a Fortune 500 member. In fact, from 1980 to 1990, Savannah Foods was number two in total returns to shareholders with a total return of 4,862 percent. Over the years, he also served as the director of several national and international associations. In 1999, he was inducted into the Georgia Southern University's Business Hall of Fame. He was very involved in the Savannah community, serving as director, trustee, or president for numerous community organizations, and he also worked to improve the lives of people in the community in which he lived.

From 1972 to 1994, he was chairman of the board and the CEO of Savannah Foods and Industries, which was the maker of Dixie Crystals sugar. Under his leadership, Savannah Foods grew from a small regional sugar refinery to a major national sugar company and a Fortune 500 member. In fact, from 1980 to 1990, Savannah Foods was number two in total returns to shareholders with a total return of 4,862 percent. Over the years, he also served as the director of several national and international associations. In 1999, he was inducted into the Georgia Southern University's Business Hall of Fame.

This will ensure that women receive high quality medical care while protecting the life of the unborn. West Michigan and the Second District of Michigan are home to passionate and dedicated pro-life organizations in Grand Rapids, Holland, and the Tri-Cities area, and Muskegon, Newaygo, and Mason Counties. Later this month, hundreds of thousands of Americans, including many [[Page H116]] from west Michigan, will be marching in their hometowns, as well as in Washington, D.C., as they honor the sanctity of life. I look forward to joining them. ____________________",package_114_278.csv,1517,1517,1586,"[congressional record volume 162, number 4 (thursday, january 7, 2016)] [house] [pages h115-h116] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] march for life (mr. huizenga of michigan asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, yesterday we made history. for the first time, congress put a bill on a president's desk to defund planned parenthood, an organization that puts its financial interests ahead of women and children. more than that, congress is investing in women's health by redirecting this funding to organizations that don't take innocent lives. in michigan, there are 20 federally qualified health clinics for every single planned parenthood location. let's eliminate funding for planned parenthood and invest those dollars in federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics. this will ensure that women receive high quality medical care while protecting the life of the unborn. west michigan and the second district of michigan are home to passionate and dedicated pro-life organizations in grand rapids, holland, and the tri-cities area, and muskegon, newaygo, and mason counties. later this month, hundreds of thousands of americans, including many [[page h116]] from west michigan, will be marching in their hometowns, as well as in washington, d.c., as they honor the sanctity of life. i look forward to joining them. ____________________",1517
