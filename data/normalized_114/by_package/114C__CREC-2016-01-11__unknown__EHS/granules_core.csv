CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgH225-4,CREC-2016-01-11,114,"RECOGNIZING UNIFI MANUFACTURING, INCORPORATED FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO RECYCLING","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Page H225] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING UNIFI MANUFACTURING, INCORPORATED FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO RECYCLING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commend Unifi Manufacturing, Incorporated for its commitment to recycling. Headquartered in Greensboro, Unifi is a leading producer and processor of multifilament polyester and nylon textured yarns. They provide innovative, global textile solutions and unique branded yarns for customers at every level of the supply chain. Unifi employs about 950 people in North Carolina's Fifth District at its Repreve Recycling Center in Yadkinville. The company is currently constructing an 85,000-square-foot expansion that will more than double the size of the facility. Repreve is polyester yarn made from chips that come mainly from recycled plastic bottles and industrial fiber waste. These environmentally friendly yarns have been used in products for customers that include Ford, The North Face, Nike, Haggar, Quiksilver, Volcom, and Patagonia. For example, a classic fit casual dress pant by Haggar features seven recycled bottles. Seat covers in a Ford F-150 truck contain 16 recycled bottles. Unifi is currently converting about 42 million pounds of recycled products a year into chips at its Yadkinville facility. That includes 31 million pounds of post-consumer plastic bottles and 11 million pounds of post-industrial fiber and fabric waste. Once the expansion is complete, it will recycle 72 million pounds annually. At current production levels, the Yadkinville center accounts annually for the conversion of 900 million recycled plastic bottles and saves the equivalent of 16 million gallons of gasoline that would be required to make new polyester and nylon. Last spring, Unifi also opened a 1-megawatt solar farm onsite in Yadkinville. The solar farm is projected to provide about 10 percent of the energy needed to run the recycling center. Additionally, Unifi is expanding the Repreve brand through its 60 percent interest in Repreve Renewables, a biomass feedstock company that focuses on the direct sales of Freedom Giant Miscanthus to farmers. Some analysts believe this type of grass is extremely efficient in converting sunlight to biomass energy. It also produces more fuel than any other biofuel source. Repreve Renewables has had significant commercial success with Thrivez, its poultry bedding brand. Thrivez regrows annually without replanting, reducing soil erosion, improving water quality, and minimizing water, herbicide, and fertilizer needs. Unifi has been profitable for 5 consecutive years, and Repreve has expanded from two main apparel customers in 2007 to 32 in 2015. I commend Unifi for achieving economic success through sustainability. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Page H225] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING UNIFI MANUFACTURING, INCORPORATED FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO RECYCLING The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today is the ninth day of armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon--lawless, reckless behavior. As the Audubon Society points out: putting one of America's most important wildlife refuges at risk and threatening Federal employees. David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, points out they are trampling on the rights of every American, they are the opposite of conservatives, and they will continue to bully, threaten, and test the limits of civil society until they are stopped. Jenkins urged the Obama administration to follow Teddy Roosevelt's advice that the law must be enforced with resolute firmness. I fully understand policy differences, that compromises must be made and that there will be mistakes. I have worked with my Republican colleague Greg Walden, whose neighboring district goes all the way to the Idaho border, as we struggled to make broad Federal policy work better for everyone as we spent several years developing a vision for Mount Hood that included protections for wilderness and [[Page H226]] practices for infrastructure and management. It is an ongoing effort. But with 323 million Americans, diverse landscapes, and philosophies that are buried, there are going to be struggles and differences that continue. The answer is to keep working to find common ground, like we did with our staff and families on a 3-day hike around that magnificent mountain. For that moment, Mount Hood wasn't the dividing line between our districts; it was a point around which we could come together to agree and work to make things better. It brought us together. That is exactly what needs to happen now. There are tremendous challenges in our State of Oregon. We have a wildlife refuge in the Klamath Basin with a historic opportunity to remove unnecessary dams that even the private owner doesn't feel it could maintain, to help restore damage to salmon runs, to be able to deal with a parched wildlife basin in the middle of a desert. The Federal Government has promised far more in that basin to the stakeholders than it can deliver. There is a huge responsibility for all of us in the Federal Government to help unwind this unsustainable situation. Native Americans, particularly in the Northwest, despite solemn treaty rights promised to them by the Federal Government and ratified by Congress, have long been abused and ignored. They deserve to be taken seriously and their rights respected. There are opportunities, like dam removal, that signal a winning opportunity to keep faith with our environmental responsibilities and treaty obligations to Native Americans, to wildlife, and to the surrounding area. Far from being a threat to the region's economy, the removal, in an environmentally responsible way, of the four dams which generate little energy will provide hundreds of family wage jobs for years that will inject badly needed money into the region in the deconstruction phase, to say nothing of the long-term benefits for tourism, recreation, and enhanced environment. Let's seize the opportunity in the Klamath. Let's take the opportunity to implement the long-term vision and water restoration for the Malheur Basin. These are items where hundreds and hundreds of people have labored in good faith for tens of thousands of hours. They don't need armed outsiders to come to Oregon, threatening public safety and the precious resources for their own political gains. We ought to be able, in our region, to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, discord, and the specter of dissension, anger, and a continued sense of victimhood and loss. We don't have to do that. Let's build on the progress that we have established and work together to make these people and ourselves winners. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H225-H226] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MALHEUR WILDLIFE REFUGE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today is the ninth day of armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon--lawless, reckless behavior. As the Audubon Society points out: putting one of America's most important wildlife refuges at risk and threatening Federal employees. David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, points out they are trampling on the rights of every American, they are the opposite of conservatives, and they will continue to bully, threaten, and test the limits of civil society until they are stopped. Jenkins urged the Obama administration to follow Teddy Roosevelt's advice that the law must be enforced with resolute firmness. I fully understand policy differences, that compromises must be made and that there will be mistakes. I have worked with my Republican colleague Greg Walden, whose neighboring district goes all the way to the Idaho border, as we struggled to make broad Federal policy work better for everyone as we spent several years developing a vision for Mount Hood that included protections for wilderness and [[Page H226]] practices for infrastructure and management. It is an ongoing effort. But with 323 million Americans, diverse landscapes, and philosophies that are buried, there are going to be struggles and differences that continue. The answer is to keep working to find common ground, like we did with our staff and families on a 3-day hike around that magnificent mountain. For that moment, Mount Hood wasn't the dividing line between our districts; it was a point around which we could come together to agree and work to make things better. It brought us together. That is exactly what needs to happen now. There are tremendous challenges in our State of Oregon. We have a wildlife refuge in the Klamath Basin with a historic opportunity to remove unnecessary dams that even the private owner doesn't feel it could maintain, to help restore damage to salmon runs, to be able to deal with a parched wildlife basin in the middle of a desert. The Federal Government has promised far more in that basin to the stakeholders than it can deliver. There is a huge responsibility for all of us in the Federal Government to help unwind this unsustainable situation. Native Americans, particularly in the Northwest, despite solemn treaty rights promised to them by the Federal Government and ratified by Congress, have long been abused and ignored. They deserve to be taken seriously and their rights respected. There are opportunities, like dam removal, that signal a winning opportunity to keep faith with our environmental responsibilities and treaty obligations to Native Americans, to wildlife, and to the surrounding area. Far from being a threat to the region's economy, the removal, in an environmentally responsible way, of the four dams which generate little energy will provide hundreds of family wage jobs for years that will inject badly needed money into the region in the deconstruction phase, to say nothing of the long-term benefits for tourism, recreation, and enhanced environment. Let's seize the opportunity in the Klamath. Let's take the opportunity to implement the long-term vision and water restoration for the Malheur Basin. These are items where hundreds and hundreds of people have labored in good faith for tens of thousands of hours. They don't need armed outsiders to come to Oregon, threatening public safety and the precious resources for their own political gains. We ought to be able, in our region, to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, discord, and the specter of dissension, anger, and a continued sense of victimhood and loss. We don't have to do that.

As a pilot, she towed targets for live antiaircraft practice, helped deliver planes to overseas bases, and tested new aircraft. Of the 1,000 women who were WASPs, 38 were killed during their missions. Sixteen of these unsung heroes still live in Texas, and these pilots are part of the Greatest Generation. WASPs were considered civilians until 1977. Then Congress granted them veteran status. In 2002, the WASPs were allowed to be cremated and have their ashes placed in Arlington National Cemetery, but now bureaucrats have decided that these veterans are not worthy of having a proper military burial and have revoked burial rights in Arlington.

Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk to this Congress about my hometown of Flint, Michigan. This morning I wrote to the President and wrote a letter to our Governor, asking for help for my hometown. Almost beyond belief, for a year and a half, the city of Flint has had water running through the pipes and into the homes of the people in Flint. The water has extraordinarily high levels of lead, which can affect the trajectory of a child's life permanently. This was a decision made by the State government when it took over the city of Flint because of its financial situation. To save a few dollars, it switched from Lake Huron as its primary water source to the Flint River, without even any science or thought as to how the river might be treated. As a result, that corrosive river has put lead into the water source and into the bodies of young children. Today, finally, after months and months and months, apparently, our Governor is going to announce some sort of response at the State level. I can assure you this: There is no confidence of the people of the city of Flint and of the people of Michigan--I have, certainly, no confidence myself--that the State's response will be adequate. I am asking the Federal Government to step in and help correct this manmade disaster in Flint, Michigan.

Almost beyond belief, for a year and a half, the city of Flint has had water running through the pipes and into the homes of the people in Flint. The water has extraordinarily high levels of lead, which can affect the trajectory of a child's life permanently. This was a decision made by the State government when it took over the city of Flint because of its financial situation. To save a few dollars, it switched from Lake Huron as its primary water source to the Flint River, without even any science or thought as to how the river might be treated. As a result, that corrosive river has put lead into the water source and into the bodies of young children. Today, finally, after months and months and months, apparently, our Governor is going to announce some sort of response at the State level. I can assure you this: There is no confidence of the people of the city of Flint and of the people of Michigan--I have, certainly, no confidence myself--that the State's response will be adequate. I am asking the Federal Government to step in and help correct this manmade disaster in Flint, Michigan.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 142) to require special packaging for liquid nicotine containers, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 142 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. SPECIAL PACKAGING FOR LIQUID NICOTINE CONTAINERS. (a) Requirement.--Notwithstanding section 2(f)(2) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(2)) and section 3(a)(5) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(5)), any nicotine provided in a liquid nicotine container sold, offered for sale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce, or imported into the United States shall be packaged in accordance with the standards provided in section 1700.15 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, as determined through testing in accordance with the method described in section 1700.20 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, and any subsequent changes to such sections adopted by the Commission.

EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. General Leave Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Recently there has been a significant amount of debate surrounding liquid nicotine, ranging from its use as cigarette cessation to its use in public spaces. While there are differing points on the future of vaping, everyone can agree on the need to prevent the product from inadvertently reaching the hands of children. That is why my colleague from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and I introduced the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act, which simply requires child safety packaging be added to liquid nicotine containers. The bill we are considering today and have already passed in the Senate is identical to our bill, which passed out of the Committee on Energy and Commerce in October of last year. [[Page H228]] Liquid nicotine, the product that is used in vaping pipes, is getting into the hands of children at a startling rate. I witnessed this firsthand when I had the opportunity to visit the Indiana Poison Control Centers last year. Their director, Dr. Jim Mowry, shared with me that exposures to e- cigarettes in Indiana alone have increased eightfold from 2011 to 2014. The numbers nationwide are even more startling, with poison control centers across the country showing a 14-fold increase in the exposure to e-cigarettes, from 271 cases in 2011 to just under 4,000 cases in 2014. Attracted by flavors like Skittles and Apple Jacks, curious children are often tempted to taste this liquid. Unfortunately, a single teaspoon of this liquid can be deadly to a child if it is either ingested or absorbed through the skin. Since there are no safety packaging requirements currently under Federal law, children aren't hindered in any way from having access to this potentially lethal product. With vaping becoming even more popular across the country and with an estimated 36 percent of e-cigarette users not locking up bottles of liquid nicotine or using childproof caps, I fear these calls to the poison control centers will only continue to rise. That is why the bill in front of us today is so important. Very simply, it solves the problem that we have by applying to liquid nicotine the existing childproofing requirements found in the Poison Prevention Act. We shield our children from hazardous products. Liquid nicotine should be no exception. Now, I know that the FDA also plans to regulate in this space and some have expressed worry about the overlapping regulations that this bill might impose. I am hopeful that the savings clause that we have added to the bill will allay the fears of those skeptics since it explicitly allows the FDA to continue its regulatory authority. There is a significant amount of debate about the FDA's authority in this area and when it will act. Regardless, since the FDA hasn't even produced a proposed rule yet, a final rule will likely not be finalized for over a year. That is a year of more calls to poison control centers across the country and a year of kids being needlessly exposed to an easily preventable danger. Let's solve the problem right now by passing this legislation and sending it to the President's desk today. In closing, I express my thanks to my colleague, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty). This is something that I know she has worked on for quite some time; so, I thank her for helping to spearhead this effort and for helping us to craft a bill that will protect children for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 142, the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act, which would protect children from exposure to liquid nicotine. Liquid nicotine comes in a variety of flavors, like orange, grape, bubblegum, and cotton candy, which appeal to kids, and many of these liquid nicotine products are easily accessible to children for contact and consumption. At this time, there is no existing standard to protect against accidental poisoning. The threat of poisoning is not an imagined threat. About a year ago the first American victim--a 1-year-old--died from liquid nicotine poisoning. The number of calls to poison control centers about liquid nicotine continues to rise, and more than half of those reported exposures occurred in children who were under 6 years of age. This bill, as you heard, takes the commonsense step of directing the Consumer Product Safety Commission to limit the risks of child liquid nicotine poisoning by requiring special packaging for liquid nicotine containers. At the same time, it allows the Food and Drug Administration to continue with its rules on tobacco products, including the requirement for the childproof packaging of liquid nicotine. The FDA's authority to do so is clear, and I strongly encourage the Office of Management and Budget to finish its review of the tobacco rule so the rules can go into effect quickly. I hope and expect this will be as widely supported in the House as it was in the Senate. I salute Representative Brooks. I also thank Representative Elizabeth Esty for her important leadership on this critical issue and for working across the aisle, from the outset, to advance this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty). Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act. Along with Senator Nelson, I proudly introduced the Child Nicotine Prevention Act last year. This year it has been a real pleasure to work with my good friend Susan Brooks. I would like to thank her as well as Representative Schakowsky, Representative Sarbanes, Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, and all of the staff for their help on this commonsense, important-- literally, lifesaving--legislation that I hope we will pass today and put on the President's desk tonight. As a mom, I can only imagine the pain felt by parents whose children have been poisoned by a substance that, so far, the Federal Government has done nothing from which to protect their children. It is understandable that children are attracted by the liquid nicotine that is being sold right now through e-cigarettes. The packages are brightly colored. They look like candy. They have flavors like strawberry, gummy bears, cotton candy, peppermint, chocolate. Once you open the package, it smells like candy. It is not surprising, particularly at the holidays, that children who are seeing brightly colored food flavorings and who are dyeing cookies and making them bright colors would be curious. They smell it and want to taste it. Just a little over a year ago a 2-year-old died in New York from ingesting this. Even a small bottle of liquid nicotine has enough poison to kill four small children; so, I am grateful to my friends today on both sides of the aisle for having joined us to reduce the risk of these poisonings by adding the simple packaging that we are all familiar with, those plastic wrappings that are on every bottle of eyedrops, on every bottle of contact lens solution, and on all poisons and commonsense household products that we know could endanger an adult. But here we are talking about children, and they deserve our protection. Liquid nicotine, which is just as dangerous, deserves to have that packaging. This bipartisan legislation will require that all liquid nicotine quantities be childproofed. It is a simple, commonsense measure. It will save lives. I ask that all of my colleagues support this legislation today so as to ensure that liquid nicotine packaging in all sizes and shapes and colors and flavors is childproofed. We have worked very hard to ensure that we are working within the FDA's authority, giving them time to develop final rules. But, frankly, we have already waited over a year. We have already had a death in the last year, and there has been a huge increase in the number of calls to poison centers. So it is past time for us to act. Again I thank my colleagues, particularly the chairman and Susan Brooks, for their leadership. I urge my colleagues to join us today. Let's get this on the President's desk for signature. Let's get our children protected from the dangers of liquid nicotine. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, as the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) so eloquently stated, I also commend my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce for seeing the importance of this. I thank Mr. Sarbanes, the chairman, and the ranking member for moving on this commonsense legislation. I thank Ms. Esty for being a champion of the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. [[Page H229]] Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to S. 142, the ``Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act,'' which requires any nicotine provided in a liquid nicotine container sold, offered for sale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce must be in special packaging that is difficult for children under five years of age to open or access harmful contents. As the founding member and Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am in support of this bill because it places the safety of children first. Today, small children are at risk of injury and death from easily accessed liquid nicotine used to refill electronic cigarettes. Nicotine liquids used in e-cigarettes are sold without child proof packaging. Further, these nicotine products are attractive to children because they come in a wide range of candy flavors such as gummy bear, cotton candy and chocolate. Liquid nicotine is highly toxic and sold in a highly concentrated form. Many liquid nicotine products contain nearly 36 mg of nicotine per milliliter of liquid. According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids the concentrated form of nicotine in liquid form intended for use in smokeless cigarettes would only take a small 15 milliliter dose to kill four toddlers. According to the Centers for Disease Control the number of calls to poison centers involving e-cigarette liquids containing nicotine rose from one per month in September 2010 to 215 per month in February 2014. Data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) showed nearly 4,000 adverse incidents related to e-cigarette exposures in 2014, a 145 percent increase from 2013 and a 14-fold increase since 2011. In 2015, there were 1,499 calls to Poison Control Centers through May 31, 2015 that were liquid nicotine related. This bill would save children's lives by allowing the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) the authority to require the use of child-resistant packaging on liquid nicotine containers sold to consumers. The CPSC currently requires such packaging on many common toxic household substances like bleach, as well as FDA-regulated products like prescription drugs. S. 142 is needed to save children from unnecessary poisonings from liquid nicotine. The most recent National Youth Tobacco Survey showed e-cigarette use is growing fast, and now this report shows e-cigarette related poisonings are also increasing rapidly,'' said Tim McAfee, M.D., M.P.H., Director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. We all must do our part to reduce liquid nicotine poisoning of children. It will take the efforts of members of the House in voting to pass this bill, health care providers, e-cigarette companies and distributors, and the public need to join efforts to keep our children safe from potential health risk from e-cigarettes. Strategies to monitor and prevent future poisonings are critical given the rapid increase in e-cigarette related poisonings and the first step is voting for S. 142. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of S. 142, ``Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 142. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H227-H229] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHILD NICOTINE POISONING PREVENTION ACT OF 2015 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana.

EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. General Leave Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Recently there has been a significant amount of debate surrounding liquid nicotine, ranging from its use as cigarette cessation to its use in public spaces. While there are differing points on the future of vaping, everyone can agree on the need to prevent the product from inadvertently reaching the hands of children. That is why my colleague from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and I introduced the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act, which simply requires child safety packaging be added to liquid nicotine containers. The bill we are considering today and have already passed in the Senate is identical to our bill, which passed out of the Committee on Energy and Commerce in October of last year. [[Page H228]] Liquid nicotine, the product that is used in vaping pipes, is getting into the hands of children at a startling rate. I witnessed this firsthand when I had the opportunity to visit the Indiana Poison Control Centers last year. Their director, Dr. Jim Mowry, shared with me that exposures to e- cigarettes in Indiana alone have increased eightfold from 2011 to 2014. The numbers nationwide are even more startling, with poison control centers across the country showing a 14-fold increase in the exposure to e-cigarettes, from 271 cases in 2011 to just under 4,000 cases in 2014. Attracted by flavors like Skittles and Apple Jacks, curious children are often tempted to taste this liquid. Unfortunately, a single teaspoon of this liquid can be deadly to a child if it is either ingested or absorbed through the skin. Since there are no safety packaging requirements currently under Federal law, children aren't hindered in any way from having access to this potentially lethal product. With vaping becoming even more popular across the country and with an estimated 36 percent of e-cigarette users not locking up bottles of liquid nicotine or using childproof caps, I fear these calls to the poison control centers will only continue to rise. That is why the bill in front of us today is so important. Very simply, it solves the problem that we have by applying to liquid nicotine the existing childproofing requirements found in the Poison Prevention Act. We shield our children from hazardous products. Liquid nicotine should be no exception. Now, I know that the FDA also plans to regulate in this space and some have expressed worry about the overlapping regulations that this bill might impose. I am hopeful that the savings clause that we have added to the bill will allay the fears of those skeptics since it explicitly allows the FDA to continue its regulatory authority. There is a significant amount of debate about the FDA's authority in this area and when it will act. Regardless, since the FDA hasn't even produced a proposed rule yet, a final rule will likely not be finalized for over a year. That is a year of more calls to poison control centers across the country and a year of kids being needlessly exposed to an easily preventable danger. Let's solve the problem right now by passing this legislation and sending it to the President's desk today. In closing, I express my thanks to my colleague, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty). This is something that I know she has worked on for quite some time; so, I thank her for helping to spearhead this effort and for helping us to craft a bill that will protect children for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 142, the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act, which would protect children from exposure to liquid nicotine. Liquid nicotine comes in a variety of flavors, like orange, grape, bubblegum, and cotton candy, which appeal to kids, and many of these liquid nicotine products are easily accessible to children for contact and consumption. At this time, there is no existing standard to protect against accidental poisoning. The threat of poisoning is not an imagined threat. About a year ago the first American victim--a 1-year-old--died from liquid nicotine poisoning. The number of calls to poison control centers about liquid nicotine continues to rise, and more than half of those reported exposures occurred in children who were under 6 years of age. This bill, as you heard, takes the commonsense step of directing the Consumer Product Safety Commission to limit the risks of child liquid nicotine poisoning by requiring special packaging for liquid nicotine containers. At the same time, it allows the Food and Drug Administration to continue with its rules on tobacco products, including the requirement for the childproof packaging of liquid nicotine. The FDA's authority to do so is clear, and I strongly encourage the Office of Management and Budget to finish its review of the tobacco rule so the rules can go into effect quickly. I hope and expect this will be as widely supported in the House as it was in the Senate. I salute Representative Brooks. I also thank Representative Elizabeth Esty for her important leadership on this critical issue and for working across the aisle, from the outset, to advance this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty). Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act. Along with Senator Nelson, I proudly introduced the Child Nicotine Prevention Act last year. This year it has been a real pleasure to work with my good friend Susan Brooks. I would like to thank her as well as Representative Schakowsky, Representative Sarbanes, Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, and all of the staff for their help on this commonsense, important-- literally, lifesaving--legislation that I hope we will pass today and put on the President's desk tonight. As a mom, I can only imagine the pain felt by parents whose children have been poisoned by a substance that, so far, the Federal Government has done nothing from which to protect their children. It is understandable that children are attracted by the liquid nicotine that is being sold right now through e-cigarettes. The packages are brightly colored. They look like candy. They have flavors like strawberry, gummy bears, cotton candy, peppermint, chocolate. Once you open the package, it smells like candy. It is not surprising, particularly at the holidays, that children who are seeing brightly colored food flavorings and who are dyeing cookies and making them bright colors would be curious. They smell it and want to taste it. Just a little over a year ago a 2-year-old died in New York from ingesting this. Even a small bottle of liquid nicotine has enough poison to kill four small children; so, I am grateful to my friends today on both sides of the aisle for having joined us to reduce the risk of these poisonings by adding the simple packaging that we are all familiar with, those plastic wrappings that are on every bottle of eyedrops, on every bottle of contact lens solution, and on all poisons and commonsense household products that we know could endanger an adult. But here we are talking about children, and they deserve our protection. Liquid nicotine, which is just as dangerous, deserves to have that packaging. This bipartisan legislation will require that all liquid nicotine quantities be childproofed. It is a simple, commonsense measure. It will save lives. I ask that all of my colleagues support this legislation today so as to ensure that liquid nicotine packaging in all sizes and shapes and colors and flavors is childproofed. We have worked very hard to ensure that we are working within the FDA's authority, giving them time to develop final rules. But, frankly, we have already waited over a year. We have already had a death in the last year, and there has been a huge increase in the number of calls to poison centers. So it is past time for us to act. Again I thank my colleagues, particularly the chairman and Susan Brooks, for their leadership. I urge my colleagues to join us today. Let's get this on the President's desk for signature. Let's get our children protected from the dangers of liquid nicotine. Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, as the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) so eloquently stated, I also commend my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce for seeing the importance of this. I thank Mr. Sarbanes, the chairman, and the ranking member for moving on this commonsense legislation. I thank Ms. Esty for being a champion of the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. [[Page H229]] Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to S. 142, the ``Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act,'' which requires any nicotine provided in a liquid nicotine container sold, offered for sale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce must be in special packaging that is difficult for children under five years of age to open or access harmful contents. As the founding member and Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am in support of this bill because it places the safety of children first. Today, small children are at risk of injury and death from easily accessed liquid nicotine used to refill electronic cigarettes. Nicotine liquids used in e-cigarettes are sold without child proof packaging. Further, these nicotine products are attractive to children because they come in a wide range of candy flavors such as gummy bear, cotton candy and chocolate. Liquid nicotine is highly toxic and sold in a highly concentrated form. Many liquid nicotine products contain nearly 36 mg of nicotine per milliliter of liquid. According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids the concentrated form of nicotine in liquid form intended for use in smokeless cigarettes would only take a small 15 milliliter dose to kill four toddlers. According to the Centers for Disease Control the number of calls to poison centers involving e-cigarette liquids containing nicotine rose from one per month in September 2010 to 215 per month in February 2014. Data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) showed nearly 4,000 adverse incidents related to e-cigarette exposures in 2014, a 145 percent increase from 2013 and a 14-fold increase since 2011. In 2015, there were 1,499 calls to Poison Control Centers through May 31, 2015 that were liquid nicotine related. This bill would save children's lives by allowing the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) the authority to require the use of child-resistant packaging on liquid nicotine containers sold to consumers. The CPSC currently requires such packaging on many common toxic household substances like bleach, as well as FDA-regulated products like prescription drugs. S. 142 is needed to save children from unnecessary poisonings from liquid nicotine. The most recent National Youth Tobacco Survey showed e-cigarette use is growing fast, and now this report shows e-cigarette related poisonings are also increasing rapidly,'' said Tim McAfee, M.D., M.P.H., Director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. We all must do our part to reduce liquid nicotine poisoning of children. It will take the efforts of members of the House in voting to pass this bill, health care providers, e-cigarette companies and distributors, and the public need to join efforts to keep our children safe from potential health risk from e-cigarettes. Strategies to monitor and prevent future poisonings are critical given the rapid increase in e-cigarette related poisonings and the first step is voting for S. 142. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of S. 142, ``Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 142. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H227-H229] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHILD NICOTINE POISONING PREVENTION ACT OF 2015 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana.

[[page h228]] liquid nicotine, the product that is used in vaping pipes, is getting into the hands of children at a startling rate. i witnessed this firsthand when i had the opportunity to visit the indiana poison control centers last year. their director, dr. jim mowry, shared with me that exposures to e- cigarettes in indiana alone have increased eightfold from 2011 to 2014. the numbers nationwide are even more startling, with poison control centers across the country showing a 14-fold increase in the exposure to e-cigarettes, from 271 cases in 2011 to just under 4,000 cases in 2014. attracted by flavors like skittles and apple jacks, curious children are often tempted to taste this liquid. unfortunately, a single teaspoon of this liquid can be deadly to a child if it is either ingested or absorbed through the skin. since there are no safety packaging requirements currently under federal law, children aren't hindered in any way from having access to this potentially lethal product. with vaping becoming even more popular across the country and with an estimated 36 percent of e-cigarette users not locking up bottles of liquid nicotine or using childproof caps, i fear these calls to the poison control centers will only continue to rise. that is why the bill in front of us today is so important. very simply, it solves the problem that we have by applying to liquid nicotine the existing childproofing requirements found in the poison prevention act. we shield our children from hazardous products. liquid nicotine should be no exception. now, i know that the fda also plans to regulate in this space and some have expressed worry about the overlapping regulations that this bill might impose. i am hopeful that the savings clause that we have added to the bill will allay the fears of those skeptics since it explicitly allows the fda to continue its regulatory authority. there is a significant amount of debate about the fda's authority in this area and when it will act. regardless, since the fda hasn't even produced a proposed rule yet, a final rule will likely not be finalized for over a year. that is a year of more calls to poison control centers across the country and a year of kids being needlessly exposed to an easily preventable danger. let's solve the problem right now by passing this legislation and sending it to the president's desk today. in closing, i express my thanks to my colleague, the gentlewoman from connecticut (ms. esty). this is something that i know she has worked on for quite some time; so, i thank her for helping to spearhead this effort and for helping us to craft a bill that will protect children for generations to come. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. sarbanes. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of s. 142, the child nicotine poisoning prevention act, which would protect children from exposure to liquid nicotine. liquid nicotine comes in a variety of flavors, like orange, grape, bubblegum, and cotton candy, which appeal to kids, and many of these liquid nicotine products are easily accessible to children for contact and consumption. at this time, there is no existing standard to protect against accidental poisoning. the threat of poisoning is not an imagined threat. about a year ago the first american victim--a 1-year-old--died from liquid nicotine poisoning. the number of calls to poison control centers about liquid nicotine continues to rise, and more than half of those reported exposures occurred in children who were under 6 years of age. this bill, as you heard, takes the commonsense step of directing the consumer product safety commission to limit the risks of child liquid nicotine poisoning by requiring special packaging for liquid nicotine containers. at the same time, it allows the food and drug administration to continue with its rules on tobacco products, including the requirement for the childproof packaging of liquid nicotine. the fda's authority to do so is clear, and i strongly encourage the office of management and budget to finish its review of the tobacco rule so the rules can go into effect quickly. i hope and expect this will be as widely supported in the house as it was in the senate. i salute representative brooks. i also thank representative elizabeth esty for her important leadership on this critical issue and for working across the aisle, from the outset, to advance this bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. brooks of indiana. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. sarbanes. mr. speaker, i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from connecticut (ms. esty). ms. esty. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of the child nicotine poisoning prevention act. along with senator nelson, i proudly introduced the child nicotine prevention act last year. this year it has been a real pleasure to work with my good friend susan brooks. i would like to thank her as well as representative schakowsky, representative sarbanes, chairman upton, ranking member pallone, and all of the staff for their help on this commonsense, important-- literally, lifesaving--legislation that i hope we will pass today and put on the president's desk tonight. as a mom, i can only imagine the pain felt by parents whose children have been poisoned by a substance that, so far, the federal government has done nothing from which to protect their children. it is understandable that children are attracted by the liquid nicotine that is being sold right now through e-cigarettes. the packages are brightly colored. they look like candy. they have flavors like strawberry, gummy bears, cotton candy, peppermint, chocolate. once you open the package, it smells like candy. it is not surprising, particularly at the holidays, that children who are seeing brightly colored food flavorings and who are dyeing cookies and making them bright colors would be curious. they smell it and want to taste it. just a little over a year ago a 2-year-old died in new york from ingesting this. even a small bottle of liquid nicotine has enough poison to kill four small children; so, i am grateful to my friends today on both sides of the aisle for having joined us to reduce the risk of these poisonings by adding the simple packaging that we are all familiar with, those plastic wrappings that are on every bottle of eyedrops, on every bottle of contact lens solution, and on all poisons and commonsense household products that we know could endanger an adult. but here we are talking about children, and they deserve our protection. liquid nicotine, which is just as dangerous, deserves to have that packaging. this bipartisan legislation will require that all liquid nicotine quantities be childproofed. it is a simple, commonsense measure. it will save lives. i ask that all of my colleagues support this legislation today so as to ensure that liquid nicotine packaging in all sizes and shapes and colors and flavors is childproofed. we have worked very hard to ensure that we are working within the fda's authority, giving them time to develop final rules. but, frankly, we have already waited over a year. we have already had a death in the last year, and there has been a huge increase in the number of calls to poison centers. so it is past time for us to act. again i thank my colleagues, particularly the chairman and susan brooks, for their leadership. i urge my colleagues to join us today. let's get this on the president's desk for signature. let's get our children protected from the dangers of liquid nicotine. mr. sarbanes. mr. speaker, i urge support of this important bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mrs. brooks of indiana. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. in closing, as the gentlewoman from connecticut (ms. esty) so eloquently stated, i also commend my colleagues on the committee on energy and commerce for seeing the importance of this. i thank mr. sarbanes, the chairman, and the ranking member for moving on this commonsense legislation. i thank ms. esty for being a champion of the child nicotine poisoning prevention act. i urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. [[page h229]] mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise in support to s. 142, the ``child nicotine poisoning prevention act,'' which requires any nicotine provided in a liquid nicotine container sold, offered for sale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce must be in special packaging that is difficult for children under five years of age to open or access harmful contents. as the founding member and chair of the congressional children's caucus, i am in support of this bill because it places the safety of children first. today, small children are at risk of injury and death from easily accessed liquid nicotine used to refill electronic cigarettes. nicotine liquids used in e-cigarettes are sold without child proof packaging. further, these nicotine products are attractive to children because they come in a wide range of candy flavors such as gummy bear, cotton candy and chocolate. liquid nicotine is highly toxic and sold in a highly concentrated form. many liquid nicotine products contain nearly 36 mg of nicotine per milliliter of liquid. according to the campaign for tobacco free kids the concentrated form of nicotine in liquid form intended for use in smokeless cigarettes would only take a small 15 milliliter dose to kill four toddlers. according to the centers for disease control the number of calls to poison centers involving e-cigarette liquids containing nicotine rose from one per month in september 2010 to 215 per month in february 2014. data from the american association of poison control centers (aapcc) showed nearly 4,000 adverse incidents related to e-cigarette exposures in 2014, a 145 percent increase from 2013 and a 14-fold increase since 2011. in 2015, there were 1,499 calls to poison control centers through may 31, 2015 that were liquid nicotine related. this bill would save children's lives by allowing the consumer product safety commission (cpsc) the authority to require the use of child-resistant packaging on liquid nicotine containers sold to consumers. the cpsc currently requires such packaging on many common toxic household substances like bleach, as well as fda-regulated products like prescription drugs. s. 142 is needed to save children from unnecessary poisonings from liquid nicotine. the most recent national youth tobacco survey showed e-cigarette use is growing fast, and now this report shows e-cigarette related poisonings are also increasing rapidly,'' said tim mcafee, m.d., m.p.h., director of cdc's office on smoking and health. we all must do our part to reduce liquid nicotine poisoning of children. it will take the efforts of members of the house in voting to pass this bill, health care providers, e-cigarette companies and distributors, and the public need to join efforts to keep our children safe from potential health risk from e-cigarettes. strategies to monitor and prevent future poisonings are critical given the rapid increase in e-cigarette related poisonings and the first step is voting for s. 142. i ask my colleagues to join me in support of s. 142, ``child nicotine poisoning prevention act.'' the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from indiana (mrs. brooks) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 142. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",18225

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill from the Senate that we are considering. Senator Johnson of Wisconsin has put forward this bill. It has cleared the Senate, we are happy to bring this up, but I would urge its adoption. It is S. 1629, with a very long title to it: The District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act of 2015. It just rolls off the tongue. This bipartisan bill was introduced, as I said, by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and it gives judicial officials in the District of Columbia the authority they need to make personnel and managerial decisions. In 1997, Congress reorganized the District of Columbia judicial agencies, making them Federal agencies with Federal employees. This bill improves the efficiency and functions of the D.C. judicial branch by extending them authorities that are available to other Federal agencies. S. 1629 allows the D.C. courts system to collect debts and erroneous payments made to employees through installment plans of reasonable amounts. Additionally, the courts will be able to provide uniforms to nonjudicial employees. This helps address safety concerns by giving these employees greater visibility in the courthouse and in the community. Further, these reforms will allow the D.C. judicial offices to operate certain incentive programs, make use of the donations and contributions, and utilize unpaid volunteers. It brings sensible authorities to the District's judicial agencies that will allow these officers to increase efficiencies and conduct their work more effectively. We had an opportunity to mark up this bill, and I appreciate the input of Ms. Norton certainly, being from the District of Columbia. And we would urge its final passage here on the floor now. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I need to thank Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson and Ranking Member Tom Carper for sponsoring the District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act, and for all their hard work in getting it passed in the Senate. Thanks also are due to my good friend, the chairman of the Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz, and its Ranking Member, Elijah Cummings, for bringing this bill to the floor and working so closely with us in the District of Columbia. This bill may seem small, but its technical changes will improve the operations and effectiveness of three District of Columbia criminal justice agencies that are under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, and they are under that jurisdiction because of the Revitalization Act, which took over the funding of certain District of Columbia agencies because they are State agencies, to improve the financial condition of the District of Columbia, which was the only city that carried State functions. This bill gives these agencies some modest new authorities that are already available to comparable Federal agencies. The bill would authorize CSOSA to use incentives-based programs for offenders, instead of only sanctions to get compliance. This is in keeping with modern penology. It would allow the Public Defender Service to accept and use public grants, voluntary and uncompensated services, such as unpaid law clerks and interns of the kind, for example, that we use here every day, and private contributions made to advance the Public Defender Service's work. It would allow the courts to collect debts owed to it by its employees. These changes are small and they are noncontroversial, but they mean a great deal to the District of Columbia because they will modernize and improve the daily operations of the District's criminal justice system. If I may say so while the chairman is on the floor, these small changes, somehow I hope our committee will find a way to allow the courts, themselves, to do so that we do not have to bring such small changes before this body, which has such important work. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bipartisan piece of legislation. It is common sense. We should pass it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1629.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill from the Senate that we are considering. Senator Johnson of Wisconsin has put forward this bill. It has cleared the Senate, we are happy to bring this up, but I would urge its adoption. It is S. 1629, with a very long title to it: The District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act of 2015. It just rolls off the tongue. This bipartisan bill was introduced, as I said, by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and it gives judicial officials in the District of Columbia the authority they need to make personnel and managerial decisions. In 1997, Congress reorganized the District of Columbia judicial agencies, making them Federal agencies with Federal employees. This bill improves the efficiency and functions of the D.C. judicial branch by extending them authorities that are available to other Federal agencies. S. 1629 allows the D.C. courts system to collect debts and erroneous payments made to employees through installment plans of reasonable amounts. Additionally, the courts will be able to provide uniforms to nonjudicial employees. This helps address safety concerns by giving these employees greater visibility in the courthouse and in the community. Further, these reforms will allow the D.C. judicial offices to operate certain incentive programs, make use of the donations and contributions, and utilize unpaid volunteers. It brings sensible authorities to the District's judicial agencies that will allow these officers to increase efficiencies and conduct their work more effectively. We had an opportunity to mark up this bill, and I appreciate the input of Ms. Norton certainly, being from the District of Columbia. And we would urge its final passage here on the floor now. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I need to thank Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson and Ranking Member Tom Carper for sponsoring the District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act, and for all their hard work in getting it passed in the Senate. Thanks also are due to my good friend, the chairman of the Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz, and its Ranking Member, Elijah Cummings, for bringing this bill to the floor and working so closely with us in the District of Columbia. This bill may seem small, but its technical changes will improve the operations and effectiveness of three District of Columbia criminal justice agencies that are under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, and they are under that jurisdiction because of the Revitalization Act, which took over the funding of certain District of Columbia agencies because they are State agencies, to improve the financial condition of the District of Columbia, which was the only city that carried State functions. This bill gives these agencies some modest new authorities that are already available to comparable Federal agencies. The bill would authorize CSOSA to use incentives-based programs for offenders, instead of only sanctions to get compliance. This is in keeping with modern penology. It would allow the Public Defender Service to accept and use public grants, voluntary and uncompensated services, such as unpaid law clerks and interns of the kind, for example, that we use here every day, and private contributions made to advance the Public Defender Service's work. It would allow the courts to collect debts owed to it by its employees. These changes are small and they are noncontroversial, but they mean a great deal to the District of Columbia because they will modernize and improve the daily operations of the District's criminal justice system. If I may say so while the chairman is on the floor, these small changes, somehow I hope our committee will find a way to allow the courts, themselves, to do so that we do not have to bring such small changes before this body, which has such important work. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bipartisan piece of legislation. It is common sense. We should pass it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1629. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1629.

there was no objection. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, this is a bipartisan bill from the senate that we are considering. senator johnson of wisconsin has put forward this bill. it has cleared the senate, we are happy to bring this up, but i would urge its adoption. it is s. 1629, with a very long title to it: the district of columbia courts, public defender service, and court services and offender supervision agency act of 2015. it just rolls off the tongue. this bipartisan bill was introduced, as i said, by senator ron johnson of wisconsin, and it gives judicial officials in the district of columbia the authority they need to make personnel and managerial decisions. in 1997, congress reorganized the district of columbia judicial agencies, making them federal agencies with federal employees. this bill improves the efficiency and functions of the d.c. judicial branch by extending them authorities that are available to other federal agencies. s. 1629 allows the d.c. courts system to collect debts and erroneous payments made to employees through installment plans of reasonable amounts. additionally, the courts will be able to provide uniforms to nonjudicial employees. this helps address safety concerns by giving these employees greater visibility in the courthouse and in the community. further, these reforms will allow the d.c. judicial offices to operate certain incentive programs, make use of the donations and contributions, and utilize unpaid volunteers. it brings sensible authorities to the district's judicial agencies that will allow these officers to increase efficiencies and conduct their work more effectively. we had an opportunity to mark up this bill, and i appreciate the input of ms. norton certainly, being from the district of columbia. and we would urge its final passage here on the floor now. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. first, i need to thank senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee chairman ron johnson and ranking member tom carper for sponsoring the district of columbia courts, public defender service, and court services and offender supervision agency act, and for all their hard work in getting it passed in the senate. thanks also are due to my good friend, the chairman of the oversight committee, jason chaffetz, and its ranking member, elijah cummings, for bringing this bill to the floor and working so closely with us in the district of columbia. this bill may seem small, but its technical changes will improve the operations and effectiveness of three district of columbia criminal justice agencies that are under the jurisdiction of the federal government, and they are under that jurisdiction because of the revitalization act, which took over the funding of certain district of columbia agencies because they are state agencies, to improve the financial condition of the district of columbia, which was the only city that carried state functions. this bill gives these agencies some modest new authorities that are already available to comparable federal agencies. the bill would authorize csosa to use incentives-based programs for offenders, instead of only sanctions to get compliance. this is in keeping with modern penology. it would allow the public defender service to accept and use public grants, voluntary and uncompensated services, such as unpaid law clerks and interns of the kind, for example, that we use here every day, and private contributions made to advance the public defender service's work. it would allow the courts to collect debts owed to it by its employees. these changes are small and they are noncontroversial, but they mean a great deal to the district of columbia because they will modernize and improve the daily operations of the district's criminal justice system. if i may say so while the chairman is on the floor, these small changes, somehow i hope our committee will find a way to allow the courts, themselves, to do so that we do not have to bring such small changes before this body, which has such important work. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, this is a good bipartisan piece of legislation. it is common sense. we should pass it. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 1629. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",18428

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1777) to amend the Act of August 25, 1958, commonly known as the ``Former Presidents Act of 1958'', with respect to the monetary allowance payable to a former President, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1777 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Allowance Modernization Act''. SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS. (a) Relating to a Former President.--The first section of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide retirement, clerical assistants, and free mailing privileges to former Presidents of the United States, and for other purposes'', approved August 25, 1958 (3 U.S.C. 102 note), is amended by striking the matter before subsection (e) and inserting the following: ``(a) Each former President shall be entitled for the remainder of his or her life to receive from the United States-- ``(1) an annuity at the rate of $200,000 per year, subject to subsection (c); and ``(2) a monetary allowance at the rate of $200,000 per year, subject to subsections (c) and (d). ``(b)(1) The annuity and allowance under subsection (a) shall each-- ``(A) commence on the day after the individual becomes a former President; ``(B) terminate on the last day of the month before the former President dies; and ``(C) be payable by the Secretary of the Treasury on a monthly basis. ``(2) The annuity and allowance under subsection (a) shall not be payable for any period during which the former President holds an appointive or elective position in or under the Federal Government to which is attached a rate of pay other than a nominal rate. ``(c) Effective December 1 of each year, each annuity and allowance under subsection (a) having a commencement date that precedes such December 1 shall be increased by the same percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 and following) are increased, effective as of such December 1, as a result of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)). ``(d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the monetary allowance payable under subsection (a)(2) to a former President for any 12-month period may not exceed the amount by which-- ``(A) the monetary allowance which (but for this subsection) would otherwise be so payable for such 12-month period, exceeds (if at all) ``(B) the applicable reduction amount for such 12-month period. ``(2)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), the `applicable reduction amount' is, with respect to any former President and in connection with any 12-month period, the amount by which-- ``(i) the sum of (I) the adjusted gross income (as defined by section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) of the former President for the last taxable year ending before the start of such 12-month period, plus (II) any interest excluded from the gross income of the former President under section 103 of such Code for such taxable year, exceeds (if at all) ``(ii) $400,000, subject to subparagraph (C). ``(B) In the case of a joint return, subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (A)(i) shall be applied by taking into account both the amounts properly allocable to the former President and the amounts properly allocable to the spouse of the former President. ``(C) The dollar amount specified in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be adjusted at the same time that, and by the same percentage as the percentage by which, the monetary allowance of the former President is increased under subsection (c) (disregarding this subsection).''. (b) Relating to the Surviving Spouse of a Former President.-- (1) Increase in amount of monetary allowance.--Subsection (e) of the section amended by subsection (a) is amended-- (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``$20,000 per annum,'' and inserting ``$100,000 per year (subject to paragraph (4)),''; and (B) in the second sentence-- (i) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' at the end; (ii) in paragraph (3)-- (I) by striking ``or the government of the District of Columbia''; and (II) by striking the period and inserting ``; and''; and (iii) by adding after paragraph (3) the following: ``(4) shall, after its commencement date, be increased at the same time that, and by the same percentage as the percentage by which, annuities of former Presidents are increased under subsection (c).''. (2) Coverage of widower of a former president.--Such subsection (e), as amended by paragraph (1), is further amended-- (A) by striking ``widow'' each place it appears and inserting ``widow or widower''; and (B) by striking ``she'' and inserting ``she or he''.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 1777, the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act. The act updates an arcane law which no longer reflects day-to-day reality in order to reduce unnecessary costs to the taxpayers. H.R. 1777 decreases the pension of former Presidents, increases the pension of surviving spouses, and limits the allowances provided for post-Presidential expenditures. This important piece of legislation amends and modernizes the Former Presidents Act of 1958 by authorizing a $200,000 annual pension for each former President and a $100,000 annual survivor benefit for each surviving spouse. We thank these Presidents and their spouses for the unbelievable toll and service that they have given to their country. Currently, former Presidents receive an annual pension of roughly $203,700, and a surviving spouse's pension is $20,000. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act also sets an annual allowance of $200,000 for costs such as travel, staff, and office expenses that are associated with post-Presidential life. For those former Presidents that earn outside income, which most do, the $200,000 annual allowance is reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar a former President earns in outside income in excess of $400,000. [[Page H242]] So, in essence, if former Presidents want to ride off into the sunset and go fishing and enjoy the Utah sunsets, they can go do that. They will be very healthily compensated to lead that kind of lifestyle. If they choose to go out and sell books and give speeches and do all those things, more power to them. If that is what they choose to do, they can go out and make that type of money. For some, they make millions of dollars doing so. At that point, I just don't think that the taxpayers should necessarily supplement their income. They don't need it at that point. So we worked in a very good, bipartisan way with Ranking Member Elijah Cummings from Maryland. We worked to do this together. We introduced this in a bipartisan way. I want our Members to know that, if this bill passes, it would save nearly $10 million in the first 5 years. In fiscal year 2015, Congress appropriated $3.2 million for pensions, office staff, and related expenses for former Presidents. Of that amount, the General Services Administration made $1.1 million in rental payments for office space. The annual allowance provision under H.R. 1777 replaces the millions of dollars currently provided for travel, staff, and office expenses of former Presidents and ends an unnecessary government handout to former Presidents that decide to make millions after leaving office. This bill does not affect the security or protection of former Presidents or family members of a former President. But, rather, H.R. 1777 brings an end to the American taxpayer subsidizing expenditures for former Presidents. Unfortunately, both sides of the aisle recognize that, no matter who the President is, in this modern age, they are going to have security concerns the rest of their lives. Under this bill, all of those expenses for the Secret Service and those type of expenditures will continue to be paid for, at no expense. No matter their income, it is a duty and obligation of the Federal Government to protect these former Presidents, and they will continue to do so. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act modernizes the Former Presidents Act while reducing unnecessary costs to the taxpayers. Again, I want to thank Ranking Member Cummings, who was an original cosponsor of this bill. I also want to thank Representative Grothman from Wisconsin, who cosponsored and worked on this piece of legislation. I urge Members to vote in favor of this. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1777, the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act. I want to thank my good friends, Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings of the Oversight Committee, for their work on this important update of Presidential legislation. This is what this bill would do: It would update what has become an arcane law and reduce unnecessary costs to the taxpayer. The bill would amend the Former Presidents Act of 1958 to provide a $200,000 annual pension for each former President and a $100,000 annual survivor benefit to each surviving spouse. The pensions are indexed to inflation and would increase with the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. Currently, surviving spouses receive $20,000--an interesting disparity between the spouse and the former President--and former Presidents receive a pension equal to the pay for Cabinet Secretaries, which for 2015 is $203,700. The bill would also provide an annual allowance of $200,000 for costs associated with post-Presidential life. The annual allowance would replace amounts currently provided for travel, staff, and office expenses, which totaled $3.25 million in fiscal year 2015 for the four living former Presidents. The allowance would be reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar a former President earns in outside income in excess of $400,000. {time} 1645 So, you see, there might be no Presidential pension if the President does what most Presidents have done, which is to almost not be able to help earning outside income. Updating the allowance ends an unnecessary government handout to former Presidents making millions of dollars after leaving office. There is little reason why American taxpayers should be subsidizing these former Presidents when they are making a comfortable living on their own work. This legislation would not affect the funding for the security and protection of former Presidents and their spouses, and that is an important provision, considering the world in which we live today. Last, Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank my good friend, Chairman Chaffetz, for the amendment, my amendment to the bill in committee to eliminate the prohibition on preventing a former President or surviving spouse from receiving a pension during the period of time he or she holds office in the District of Columbia. Imagine that. When this bill was written, it was a double-dipping bill, and they thought that some President would leave office and want to, somehow, seek work in the District of Columbia. Hardly, but I can understand that provision, and I thank the chairman that this double- dipping provision, he and I both find, is no longer necessary. While this language may have made sense in 1958, that was before the District even had home rule. The District had no mayor or city council. It was under the total dominance of the Federal Government. Since then, of course, there have been changes that I am pleased to applaud, and the government of the District of Columbia pays for the pensions of its own employees, so the Federal Government isn't in it at all. There is no reason the concern that a former President would receive both a pension and a salary from the Federal Government should still be a part of our law. This is a good-government bill that makes fiscal sense by reducing taxpayer-funded costs. I certainly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 1777. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge its passage. I really and truly enjoyed working with Members on both sides of the aisle to get this through and urge its adoption. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I want to thank the chairman. We are off to a good start in this second session of this Congress. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1777, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H241-H242] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL ALLOWANCE MODERNIZATION ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

(a) Relating to a Former President.--The first section of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide retirement, clerical assistants, and free mailing privileges to former Presidents of the United States, and for other purposes'', approved August 25, 1958 (3 U.S.C. 102 note), is amended by striking the matter before subsection (e) and inserting the following: ``(a) Each former President shall be entitled for the remainder of his or her life to receive from the United States-- ``(1) an annuity at the rate of $200,000 per year, subject to subsection (c); and ``(2) a monetary allowance at the rate of $200,000 per year, subject to subsections (c) and (d). ``(b)(1) The annuity and allowance under subsection (a) shall each-- ``(A) commence on the day after the individual becomes a former President; ``(B) terminate on the last day of the month before the former President dies; and ``(C) be payable by the Secretary of the Treasury on a monthly basis. ``(2) The annuity and allowance under subsection (a) shall not be payable for any period during which the former President holds an appointive or elective position in or under the Federal Government to which is attached a rate of pay other than a nominal rate. ``(c) Effective December 1 of each year, each annuity and allowance under subsection (a) having a commencement date that precedes such December 1 shall be increased by the same percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 and following) are increased, effective as of such December 1, as a result of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)). ``(d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the monetary allowance payable under subsection (a)(2) to a former President for any 12-month period may not exceed the amount by which-- ``(A) the monetary allowance which (but for this subsection) would otherwise be so payable for such 12-month period, exceeds (if at all) ``(B) the applicable reduction amount for such 12-month period. ``(2)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), the `applicable reduction amount' is, with respect to any former President and in connection with any 12-month period, the amount by which-- ``(i) the sum of (I) the adjusted gross income (as defined by section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) of the former President for the last taxable year ending before the start of such 12-month period, plus (II) any interest excluded from the gross income of the former President under section 103 of such Code for such taxable year, exceeds (if at all) ``(ii) $400,000, subject to subparagraph (C). ``(B) In the case of a joint return, subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (A)(i) shall be applied by taking into account both the amounts properly allocable to the former President and the amounts properly allocable to the spouse of the former President. ``(C) The dollar amount specified in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be adjusted at the same time that, and by the same percentage as the percentage by which, the monetary allowance of the former President is increased under subsection (c) (disregarding this subsection).''.

(2) Coverage of widower of a former president.--Such subsection (e), as amended by paragraph (1), is further amended-- (A) by striking ``widow'' each place it appears and inserting ``widow or widower''; and (B) by striking ``she'' and inserting ``she or he''. SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. Nothing in this Act shall be considered to affect-- (1) any provision of law relating to the security or protection of a former President or a member of the family of a former President; or (2) funding, under the law amended by this section or under any other law, to carry out any provision of law described in paragraph (1).

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 1777, the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act. The act updates an arcane law which no longer reflects day-to-day reality in order to reduce unnecessary costs to the taxpayers. H.R. 1777 decreases the pension of former Presidents, increases the pension of surviving spouses, and limits the allowances provided for post-Presidential expenditures. This important piece of legislation amends and modernizes the Former Presidents Act of 1958 by authorizing a $200,000 annual pension for each former President and a $100,000 annual survivor benefit for each surviving spouse. We thank these Presidents and their spouses for the unbelievable toll and service that they have given to their country. Currently, former Presidents receive an annual pension of roughly $203,700, and a surviving spouse's pension is $20,000. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act also sets an annual allowance of $200,000 for costs such as travel, staff, and office expenses that are associated with post-Presidential life. For those former Presidents that earn outside income, which most do, the $200,000 annual allowance is reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar a former President earns in outside income in excess of $400,000. [[Page H242]] So, in essence, if former Presidents want to ride off into the sunset and go fishing and enjoy the Utah sunsets, they can go do that. They will be very healthily compensated to lead that kind of lifestyle. If they choose to go out and sell books and give speeches and do all those things, more power to them. If that is what they choose to do, they can go out and make that type of money. For some, they make millions of dollars doing so. At that point, I just don't think that the taxpayers should necessarily supplement their income. They don't need it at that point. So we worked in a very good, bipartisan way with Ranking Member Elijah Cummings from Maryland. We worked to do this together. We introduced this in a bipartisan way. I want our Members to know that, if this bill passes, it would save nearly $10 million in the first 5 years. In fiscal year 2015, Congress appropriated $3.2 million for pensions, office staff, and related expenses for former Presidents. Of that amount, the General Services Administration made $1.1 million in rental payments for office space. The annual allowance provision under H.R. 1777 replaces the millions of dollars currently provided for travel, staff, and office expenses of former Presidents and ends an unnecessary government handout to former Presidents that decide to make millions after leaving office. This bill does not affect the security or protection of former Presidents or family members of a former President. But, rather, H.R. 1777 brings an end to the American taxpayer subsidizing expenditures for former Presidents. Unfortunately, both sides of the aisle recognize that, no matter who the President is, in this modern age, they are going to have security concerns the rest of their lives. Under this bill, all of those expenses for the Secret Service and those type of expenditures will continue to be paid for, at no expense. No matter their income, it is a duty and obligation of the Federal Government to protect these former Presidents, and they will continue to do so. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act modernizes the Former Presidents Act while reducing unnecessary costs to the taxpayers. Again, I want to thank Ranking Member Cummings, who was an original cosponsor of this bill. I also want to thank Representative Grothman from Wisconsin, who cosponsored and worked on this piece of legislation. I urge Members to vote in favor of this. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1777, the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act. I want to thank my good friends, Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings of the Oversight Committee, for their work on this important update of Presidential legislation. This is what this bill would do: It would update what has become an arcane law and reduce unnecessary costs to the taxpayer. The bill would amend the Former Presidents Act of 1958 to provide a $200,000 annual pension for each former President and a $100,000 annual survivor benefit to each surviving spouse. The pensions are indexed to inflation and would increase with the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. Currently, surviving spouses receive $20,000--an interesting disparity between the spouse and the former President--and former Presidents receive a pension equal to the pay for Cabinet Secretaries, which for 2015 is $203,700. The bill would also provide an annual allowance of $200,000 for costs associated with post-Presidential life. The annual allowance would replace amounts currently provided for travel, staff, and office expenses, which totaled $3.25 million in fiscal year 2015 for the four living former Presidents. The allowance would be reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar a former President earns in outside income in excess of $400,000. {time} 1645 So, you see, there might be no Presidential pension if the President does what most Presidents have done, which is to almost not be able to help earning outside income. Updating the allowance ends an unnecessary government handout to former Presidents making millions of dollars after leaving office. There is little reason why American taxpayers should be subsidizing these former Presidents when they are making a comfortable living on their own work. This legislation would not affect the funding for the security and protection of former Presidents and their spouses, and that is an important provision, considering the world in which we live today. Last, Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank my good friend, Chairman Chaffetz, for the amendment, my amendment to the bill in committee to eliminate the prohibition on preventing a former President or surviving spouse from receiving a pension during the period of time he or she holds office in the District of Columbia. Imagine that. When this bill was written, it was a double-dipping bill, and they thought that some President would leave office and want to, somehow, seek work in the District of Columbia. Hardly, but I can understand that provision, and I thank the chairman that this double- dipping provision, he and I both find, is no longer necessary. While this language may have made sense in 1958, that was before the District even had home rule. The District had no mayor or city council. It was under the total dominance of the Federal Government. Since then, of course, there have been changes that I am pleased to applaud, and the government of the District of Columbia pays for the pensions of its own employees, so the Federal Government isn't in it at all. There is no reason the concern that a former President would receive both a pension and a salary from the Federal Government should still be a part of our law. This is a good-government bill that makes fiscal sense by reducing taxpayer-funded costs. I certainly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 1777. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge its passage. I really and truly enjoyed working with Members on both sides of the aisle to get this through and urge its adoption. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I want to thank the chairman. We are off to a good start in this second session of this Congress. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1777, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H241-H242] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL ALLOWANCE MODERNIZATION ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

(2) widows.--in the case of any individual who is the widow of a former president on the date of enactment of this act, the amendments made by section 2(b)(1) shall be applied as if the commencement date referred to in subsection (e)(1) of the section amended by this act coincided with such date of enactment. the speaker pro tempore (mr. costello of pennsylvania). pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the district of columbia (ms. norton) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from utah. general leave mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from utah? there was no objection. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise today in support of h.r. 1777, the presidential allowance modernization act. the act updates an arcane law which no longer reflects day-to-day reality in order to reduce unnecessary costs to the taxpayers. h.r. 1777 decreases the pension of former presidents, increases the pension of surviving spouses, and limits the allowances provided for post-presidential expenditures. this important piece of legislation amends and modernizes the former presidents act of 1958 by authorizing a $200,000 annual pension for each former president and a $100,000 annual survivor benefit for each surviving spouse. we thank these presidents and their spouses for the unbelievable toll and service that they have given to their country. currently, former presidents receive an annual pension of roughly $203,700, and a surviving spouse's pension is $20,000. the presidential allowance modernization act also sets an annual allowance of $200,000 for costs such as travel, staff, and office expenses that are associated with post-presidential life. for those former presidents that earn outside income, which most do, the $200,000 annual allowance is reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar a former president earns in outside income in excess of $400,000. [[page h242]] so, in essence, if former presidents want to ride off into the sunset and go fishing and enjoy the utah sunsets, they can go do that. they will be very healthily compensated to lead that kind of lifestyle. if they choose to go out and sell books and give speeches and do all those things, more power to them. if that is what they choose to do, they can go out and make that type of money. for some, they make millions of dollars doing so. at that point, i just don't think that the taxpayers should necessarily supplement their income. they don't need it at that point. so we worked in a very good, bipartisan way with ranking member elijah cummings from maryland. we worked to do this together. we introduced this in a bipartisan way. i want our members to know that, if this bill passes, it would save nearly $10 million in the first 5 years. in fiscal year 2015, congress appropriated $3.2 million for pensions, office staff, and related expenses for former presidents. of that amount, the general services administration made $1.1 million in rental payments for office space. the annual allowance provision under h.r. 1777 replaces the millions of dollars currently provided for travel, staff, and office expenses of former presidents and ends an unnecessary government handout to former presidents that decide to make millions after leaving office. this bill does not affect the security or protection of former presidents or family members of a former president. but, rather, h.r. 1777 brings an end to the american taxpayer subsidizing expenditures for former presidents. unfortunately, both sides of the aisle recognize that, no matter who the president is, in this modern age, they are going to have security concerns the rest of their lives. under this bill, all of those expenses for the secret service and those type of expenditures will continue to be paid for, at no expense. no matter their income, it is a duty and obligation of the federal government to protect these former presidents, and they will continue to do so. the presidential allowance modernization act modernizes the former presidents act while reducing unnecessary costs to the taxpayers. again, i want to thank ranking member cummings, who was an original cosponsor of this bill. i also want to thank representative grothman from wisconsin, who cosponsored and worked on this piece of legislation. i urge members to vote in favor of this. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 1777, the presidential allowance modernization act. i want to thank my good friends, chairman chaffetz and ranking member cummings of the oversight committee, for their work on this important update of presidential legislation. this is what this bill would do: it would update what has become an arcane law and reduce unnecessary costs to the taxpayer. the bill would amend the former presidents act of 1958 to provide a $200,000 annual pension for each former president and a $100,000 annual survivor benefit to each surviving spouse. the pensions are indexed to inflation and would increase with the social security cost-of-living adjustment. currently, surviving spouses receive $20,000--an interesting disparity between the spouse and the former president--and former presidents receive a pension equal to the pay for cabinet secretaries, which for 2015 is $203,700. the bill would also provide an annual allowance of $200,000 for costs associated with post-presidential life. the annual allowance would replace amounts currently provided for travel, staff, and office expenses, which totaled $3.25 million in fiscal year 2015 for the four living former presidents. the allowance would be reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar a former president earns in outside income in excess of $400,000. {time} 1645 so, you see, there might be no presidential pension if the president does what most presidents have done, which is to almost not be able to help earning outside income. updating the allowance ends an unnecessary government handout to former presidents making millions of dollars after leaving office. there is little reason why american taxpayers should be subsidizing these former presidents when they are making a comfortable living on their own work. this legislation would not affect the funding for the security and protection of former presidents and their spouses, and that is an important provision, considering the world in which we live today. last, mr. speaker, i want to particularly thank my good friend, chairman chaffetz, for the amendment, my amendment to the bill in committee to eliminate the prohibition on preventing a former president or surviving spouse from receiving a pension during the period of time he or she holds office in the district of columbia. imagine that. when this bill was written, it was a double-dipping bill, and they thought that some president would leave office and want to, somehow, seek work in the district of columbia. hardly, but i can understand that provision, and i thank the chairman that this double- dipping provision, he and i both find, is no longer necessary. while this language may have made sense in 1958, that was before the district even had home rule. the district had no mayor or city council. it was under the total dominance of the federal government. since then, of course, there have been changes that i am pleased to applaud, and the government of the district of columbia pays for the pensions of its own employees, so the federal government isn't in it at all. there is no reason the concern that a former president would receive both a pension and a salary from the federal government should still be a part of our law. this is a good-government bill that makes fiscal sense by reducing taxpayer-funded costs. i certainly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support h.r. 1777. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i have no additional speakers. i urge its passage. i really and truly enjoyed working with members on both sides of the aisle to get this through and urge its adoption. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i have no additional speakers. i want to thank the chairman. we are off to a good start in this second session of this congress. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1777, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",14954
CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgH244,CREC-2016-01-11,114,GRANTS OVERSIGHT AND NEW EFFICIENCY ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H244-H246] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GRANTS OVERSIGHT AND NEW EFFICIENCY ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1115) to close out expired grants. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1115 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(c) Inspector General Review.--Not later than 1 year after the date on which the head of an agency provides notice to Congress under subsection (b)(2), the Inspector General of an agency with more than $500,000,000 in annual grant funding shall conduct a risk assessment to determine if an audit or review of the agency's grant closeout process is warranted.

(4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I really want to, first, thank Senator Fischer for the great work done in a bipartisan way in order to move this bill forward. That combination, working with a Member who serves on our committee, Mr. Walberg, and the relentless work on this piece of legislation, it is often referred to as the GONE Act, Grants Oversight and New Efficiency Act. It is a good piece of bipartisan, bicameral legislative effort. I believe the bill will be effective in bringing about greater reforms for the grants closeout process, allowing agencies to save dollars and make better use of constrained resources. We cannot afford to allow grants to remain open year after year of their expiration date. The GONE Act is an important step in addressing this issue. Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for championing this bill and working through this through his work on H.R. 3089, as well as working with the Senate in order to bring it to this point this day. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the Grants Oversight and New Efficiency Act, or GONE Act--and I like that name, it is a very catchy name, and you will see why in a moment--it seeks to improve the grant management process by requiring Federal agencies to report on expired grants. The Government Accountability Office has found that expired grants are not always closed out properly. In fact, GAO found that nearly $1 billion in undisbursed balances remained in expired and dormant grant accounts; therefore, the GONE Act's name. But, Mr. Speaker, I would call this found money, not gone money. It is still there. Improving the grant closeout process will help protect taxpayer dollars and ensure that those dollars can be redirected to better uses. This act may also incline agencies and localities to use funds they have asked for. This legislation would require agencies to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and to Congress on the number of expired grants and those with undisbursed balances. For the oldest expired grants, agencies will need to explain why those grants have not been closed. The bill would also require agencies to report a year after the initial report on progress made on grant closure. Hopefully, this increased accountability will bring improvement to grant management. I commend Representatives Walberg and Lawrence for their work on this bipartisan, commonsense legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1700 Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), who is the lead person sponsoring this piece of legislation here in the House companion. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1115, the Grants Oversight and New Efficiency Act, or as we call it, the GONE Act. As the lead House sponsor of this bill, I am proud of the bipartisan, bicameral effort that has gone into this legislation. I especially want to thank the Senate champion of this bill, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Deb Fischer, and also my Michigan colleague, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, along with the staff who have worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor today. Last year, we marked up this legislation in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and passed it on to the House floor. After some additional fine-tuning made by our colleagues in the Senate, I am pleased to have the opportunity to see the GONE Act take the final step toward becoming law. Even as we debate this bill today, the Federal Government is racking up service fees to administer thousands of expired empty grant accounts--costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year. I introduced the GONE Act to bring some common sense to the grant management process and require Federal agencies to finally take action to identify these accounts with a zero balance which should be closed out. Specifically, the GONE Act will direct agencies to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to identify the total number of grant awards that remain open but have been expired for 2 years or more. HHS was chosen for this role because of the work it has done in closing out expired accounts--good work--and for its role as the agency which houses the Payment Management System. In addition to the total number of expired grants, the bill requires each agency to explain to Congress why the 30 oldest grants that remain open have not been closed. The bill also directs inspectors general for certain larger grant-making agencies to conduct a risk assessment to determine if a further review of that agency's grant [[Page H246]] closeout process is necessary. All of this information will give agencies and Congress valuable insight into issues that agencies face when it comes to a timely closeout of grants. It is my hope that this information will inform future efforts to streamline the grant's lifecycle, specifically the closeout process. In fact, S. 1115 requires OMB and HHS to submit a report to Congress on potential legislative reforms that are necessary to improve the grants lifecycle. I look forward to hearing from OMB and HHS on this topic, and I thank those agencies for the feedback they have offered on this bill. For months, Members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle have worked to develop this bill into one that will serve to advance the efficiency of the grants process. OMB, HHS, and the inspector general community have all provided helpful comments as we worked to finalize this legislation, and I am grateful for their assistance. Mr. Speaker, spending taxpayer dollars on expired and empty grant accounts is the definition of government waste. I urge my colleagues to support this bill today and send the GONE Act to the President's desk. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is a good bipartisan bill. I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1115. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H244-H246] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GRANTS OVERSIGHT AND NEW EFFICIENCY ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

As the lead House sponsor of this bill, I am proud of the bipartisan, bicameral effort that has gone into this legislation. I especially want to thank the Senate champion of this bill, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Deb Fischer, and also my Michigan colleague, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, along with the staff who have worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor today. Last year, we marked up this legislation in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and passed it on to the House floor. After some additional fine-tuning made by our colleagues in the Senate, I am pleased to have the opportunity to see the GONE Act take the final step toward becoming law. Even as we debate this bill today, the Federal Government is racking up service fees to administer thousands of expired empty grant accounts--costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year. I introduced the GONE Act to bring some common sense to the grant management process and require Federal agencies to finally take action to identify these accounts with a zero balance which should be closed out. Specifically, the GONE Act will direct agencies to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to identify the total number of grant awards that remain open but have been expired for 2 years or more. HHS was chosen for this role because of the work it has done in closing out expired accounts--good work--and for its role as the agency which houses the Payment Management System. In addition to the total number of expired grants, the bill requires each agency to explain to Congress why the 30 oldest grants that remain open have not been closed. The bill also directs inspectors general for certain larger grant-making agencies to conduct a risk assessment to determine if a further review of that agency's grant [[Page H246]] closeout process is necessary. All of this information will give agencies and Congress valuable insight into issues that agencies face when it comes to a timely closeout of grants. It is my hope that this information will inform future efforts to streamline the grant's lifecycle, specifically the closeout process. In fact, S. 1115 requires OMB and HHS to submit a report to Congress on potential legislative reforms that are necessary to improve the grants lifecycle. I look forward to hearing from OMB and HHS on this topic, and I thank those agencies for the feedback they have offered on this bill. For months, Members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle have worked to develop this bill into one that will serve to advance the efficiency of the grants process. OMB, HHS, and the inspector general community have all provided helpful comments as we worked to finalize this legislation, and I am grateful for their assistance. Mr. Speaker, spending taxpayer dollars on expired and empty grant accounts is the definition of government waste. I urge my colleagues to support this bill today and send the GONE Act to the President's desk. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is a good bipartisan bill. I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1115. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H244-H246] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GRANTS OVERSIGHT AND NEW EFFICIENCY ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

(2) Closeout.--The term ``closeout'' means a closeout of a Federal grant award conducted in accordance with part 200 of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations, including sections 200.16 and 200.343 of such title, or any successor thereto. (3) Federal grant award.--The term ``Federal grant award'' means a Federal grant award (as defined in section 200.38(a)(1) of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto), including a cooperative agreement, in an agency cash payment management system held by the United States Government for which-- (A) the grant award period of performance, including any extensions, has been expired for more than 2 years; and (B) closeout has not yet occurred in accordance with section 200.343 of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I really want to, first, thank Senator Fischer for the great work done in a bipartisan way in order to move this bill forward. That combination, working with a Member who serves on our committee, Mr. Walberg, and the relentless work on this piece of legislation, it is often referred to as the GONE Act, Grants Oversight and New Efficiency Act. It is a good piece of bipartisan, bicameral legislative effort. I believe the bill will be effective in bringing about greater reforms for the grants closeout process, allowing agencies to save dollars and make better use of constrained resources. We cannot afford to allow grants to remain open year after year of their expiration date. The GONE Act is an important step in addressing this issue. Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for championing this bill and working through this through his work on H.R. 3089, as well as working with the Senate in order to bring it to this point this day. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the Grants Oversight and New Efficiency Act, or GONE Act--and I like that name, it is a very catchy name, and you will see why in a moment--it seeks to improve the grant management process by requiring Federal agencies to report on expired grants. The Government Accountability Office has found that expired grants are not always closed out properly. In fact, GAO found that nearly $1 billion in undisbursed balances remained in expired and dormant grant accounts; therefore, the GONE Act's name. But, Mr. Speaker, I would call this found money, not gone money. It is still there. Improving the grant closeout process will help protect taxpayer dollars and ensure that those dollars can be redirected to better uses. This act may also incline agencies and localities to use funds they have asked for. This legislation would require agencies to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and to Congress on the number of expired grants and those with undisbursed balances. For the oldest expired grants, agencies will need to explain why those grants have not been closed. The bill would also require agencies to report a year after the initial report on progress made on grant closure. Hopefully, this increased accountability will bring improvement to grant management. I commend Representatives Walberg and Lawrence for their work on this bipartisan, commonsense legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1700 Mr. CHAFFETZ.

(b) Implementation.--This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall be implemented not later than June 30, 2019. SEC. 4. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED. No additional funds are authorized to carry out the requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), the prime author of this bill. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 598, the Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act. This bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort to provide more information about Federal programs and their activities online. I want to thank my colleague Jim Cooper for all his work in pushing this legislation forward. The American people deserve to know what their government does with their hard-earned dollars, don't you think? H.R. 598 will make it easier to evaluate Federal Government spending by requiring Federal agencies to identify their programs and provide basic information like what their programs do, how they perform, and how much they cost. Agencies must do a better job of managing their programs and identifying areas where taxpayer dollars are wasted. The Government Accountability Office is tasked with reporting on duplication and continues to find new areas of duplication across government. Over 5 years, GAO has identified 106 areas of duplication, overlap, and fragmentation; moreover, they identified an additional 72 areas for potential cost savings. While only 37 percent of recommended corrective actions have been taken, GAO estimates that these actions have saved the Federal Government and the taxpayer about $20 billion. While GAO's work has been invaluable, their ability to look comprehensively at the Federal Government is inherently limited because of the poor reporting by agencies about their activity. Quite simply, without better data, billions more will be lost and wasted. Current law, specifically, the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act, requires agencies to report all their programs, their funding, and their performance information to the Office of Management and Budget. However, OMB's current inventory is incomplete and provides inconsistent information. This makes it more difficult and time consuming to identify areas of waste and inefficiency. H.R. 598 establishes an across-the-board definition of ``program'' and requires the publication of detailed information on each Federal program. This change will allow American taxpayers and Federal watchdogs to better evaluate the effectiveness and utility of government programs. The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act is an important and necessary step forward for the government in providing programs that are accountable, effective, and efficient. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senator Lankford for his work on the Senate companion bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act builds upon two existing laws that came through our committee: the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 and the DATA Act, which was signed into law in 2014. The Obama administration launched the performance.gov Web site to implement the GPRA Modernization Act, and this bill would enhance the information available through that Web site. The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to make available on a central Web site an inventory of all Federal agency programs that have a budget authority of more than $1 million. The bill also would require OMB to include on this Web site links to any evaluation, assessment, or program performance reviews by an agency, an inspector general, or the Government Accountability Office released during the preceding 5 years. The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act would require agencies to disclose how much agency staff are administering each covered program, as well as other individuals whose salary is paid by the government through a contract, grant, or other agreement. The Office of Management and Budget raised serious concerns about its ability to implement the requirements of the bill as it was reported by the committee. I want to thank the chairman for making changes to help address those concerns in the amended version of the bill before us today. It is important that we continue to work together to ensure the bill will work as intended. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bipartisan, bicameral bill. Again, I thank the good work of our colleague Mr. Walberg in helping to champion this through, the good work on both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan, bicameral way. I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 598, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H246-H247] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TAXPAYERS RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT Mr. CHAFFETZ.

there was no objection. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. walberg), the prime author of this bill. mr. walberg. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 598, the taxpayers right-to-know act. this bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort to provide more information about federal programs and their activities online. i want to thank my colleague jim cooper for all his work in pushing this legislation forward. the american people deserve to know what their government does with their hard-earned dollars, don't you think? h.r. 598 will make it easier to evaluate federal government spending by requiring federal agencies to identify their programs and provide basic information like what their programs do, how they perform, and how much they cost. agencies must do a better job of managing their programs and identifying areas where taxpayer dollars are wasted. the government accountability office is tasked with reporting on duplication and continues to find new areas of duplication across government. over 5 years, gao has identified 106 areas of duplication, overlap, and fragmentation; moreover, they identified an additional 72 areas for potential cost savings. while only 37 percent of recommended corrective actions have been taken, gao estimates that these actions have saved the federal government and the taxpayer about $20 billion. while gao's work has been invaluable, their ability to look comprehensively at the federal government is inherently limited because of the poor reporting by agencies about their activity. quite simply, without better data, billions more will be lost and wasted. current law, specifically, the government performance and results modernization act, requires agencies to report all their programs, their funding, and their performance information to the office of management and budget. however, omb's current inventory is incomplete and provides inconsistent information. this makes it more difficult and time consuming to identify areas of waste and inefficiency. h.r. 598 establishes an across-the-board definition of ``program'' and requires the publication of detailed information on each federal program. this change will allow american taxpayers and federal watchdogs to better evaluate the effectiveness and utility of government programs. the taxpayers right-to-know act is an important and necessary step forward for the government in providing programs that are accountable, effective, and efficient. mr. speaker, i want to thank senator lankford for his work on the senate companion bill. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, the taxpayers right-to-know act builds upon two existing laws that came through our committee: the government performance and results modernization act of 2010 and the data act, which was signed into law in 2014. the obama administration launched the performance.gov web site to implement the gpra modernization act, and this bill would enhance the information available through that web site. the bill would require the office of management and budget to make available on a central web site an inventory of all federal agency programs that have a budget authority of more than $1 million. the bill also would require omb to include on this web site links to any evaluation, assessment, or program performance reviews by an agency, an inspector general, or the government accountability office released during the preceding 5 years. the taxpayers right-to-know act would require agencies to disclose how much agency staff are administering each covered program, as well as other individuals whose salary is paid by the government through a contract, grant, or other agreement. the office of management and budget raised serious concerns about its ability to implement the requirements of the bill as it was reported by the committee. i want to thank the chairman for making changes to help address those concerns in the amended version of the bill before us today. it is important that we continue to work together to ensure the bill will work as intended. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, this is a good bipartisan, bicameral bill. again, i thank the good work of our colleague mr. walberg in helping to champion this through, the good work on both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan, bicameral way. i urge its passage. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 598, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",14549

SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED. No additional funds are authorized to carry out the requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan), the gentleman who has championed this issue as the prime sponsor. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Chaffetz for his support and for yielding me this time. This is a bill that has passed in three separate Congresses with overwhelming bipartisan support and very, very little opposition. In fact, in this Congress, it is cosponsored by Ranking Member Elijah Cummings. In past Congresses, it has been cosponsored by Ranking Member Edolphus Towns; and in one Congress, Chairman Waxman became the primary sponsor. So it is a very bipartisan bill. It is a very simple bill, one that I think can be supported by anyone who is opposed to secrecy in government and believes in an open, transparent system. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act simply requires that donations to a President's library greater than $200 be disclosed to the public and posted online. It is very surprising to people that there are no laws governing these donations at this time. In fact, any person, corporation, or foreign government can donate any amount, unreported, while a President is still in office. I first introduced this bill in the 106th Congress after reading a front-page story in The Washington Times reporting that foreign governments from the Middle East were making very large donations to the proposed library for President Clinton. I was concerned about the influence of donations being made by foreign governments. However, I hasten to say this is not directed toward former President Clinton or anyone else. This bill has been introduced and passed, and I have sponsored this bill under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. I did read at one point that after I introduced this bill that President Clinton's library had received a $450,000 contribution from the ex-wife of Marc Rich, who had fled the country to evade $40 million in taxes. So these types of things have certainly raised concern. In 2013, the Sunlight Foundation's policy director endorsed my bill during a hearing on Federal Government transparency in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, saying: ``It would provide valuable information on special interests whose donations put them in close proximity with Presidents.'' {time} 1715 Presidential libraries were once modest structures, but they have grown rapidly over the years into megamuseums devoted to a President's life and legacy. President George W. Bush's library topped $500 million in costs. That is seven times the cost of his father's library. A recent report in The New York Times noted that President Obama's library could end up costing $1 billion. As costs soar, clearly there is potential for abuse, no matter who is President. This is, as I said, not a partisan issue. It is not directed at any President. It is simply a good government bill that I think almost everyone can support, and certainly they have in the past. I urge support for this legislation. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I support this bill, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Representative Duncan and Ranking Member Cummings for sponsoring this legislation. Representative Duncan first sponsored a bill to improve Presidential libraries 16 years ago. What has happened that we can't get this bill through the Congress? I hope this bill this year will prove different. This Congress, I hope we can finally get this important reform on the President's desk where I am sure it will be signed. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act would provide transparency to the process for building Presidential libraries. The practice of creating a Presidential library began decades ago with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The tradition has carried on through every President since that time, and it is going to continue. Presidential libraries have become increasingly more expensive as they [[Page H249]] have evolved into multipurpose centers that do more than simply house Presidential records. For example, the William J. Clinton Library cost an estimated $165 million, while the George W. Bush Presidential Center cost an estimated $250 million to build, with President Bush having raised approximately half a billion dollars for his library, museum, and institute. We can expect that with each new President, these libraries are going to cost more. That is just natural. Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the identities of those who donate to a Presidential library, and a President is able to secure an unlimited amount of private donations while still in office. The bill before us would make a simple but very important change in existing law. Under this bill, organizations that raise money to build Presidential libraries would be required to disclose the identity of any individual who donates more than $200. It seems reasonable to me, Mr. Speaker. The National Archives and Records Administration would then be required to post the donation information in a manner that is free to access and downloadable. Additionally, this legislation would create criminal penalties for individuals who report false information on donations and for fundraising organizations that omit donation information. A group of 15 good government organizations, including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the Sunlight Foundation, sent a letter urging the House to support this bill. Here is what they wrote: ``Under the current opaque system, Presidents raise funds privately to establish their Presidential libraries. These efforts, which often begin long before they leave office, are unregulated and undisclosed, creating opportunities for, or the appearance of, influence-peddling. Improved transparency would help reduce the appearance of impropriety and help deter inappropriate behavior.'' The appearance is just as important as the behavior itself, I emphasize, Mr. Speaker. This bill was approved without opposition by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in March and has passed the House several times before. As I noted, companion legislation sponsored by Senators Corker and Johnson was approved by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee earlier this year. It looks like this bill may become law after all, Mr. Duncan. I urge every Member of this body to support transparency by voting for this important legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I urge its passage. It is high time that this passed. It is bipartisan, it is bicameral, and it is done with some good leadership from Mr. Duncan. I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1069, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H247-H249] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATION REFORM ACT OF 2016 Mr. CHAFFETZ.

I first introduced this bill in the 106th Congress after reading a front-page story in The Washington Times reporting that foreign governments from the Middle East were making very large donations to the proposed library for President Clinton. I was concerned about the influence of donations being made by foreign governments. However, I hasten to say this is not directed toward former President Clinton or anyone else. This bill has been introduced and passed, and I have sponsored this bill under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. I did read at one point that after I introduced this bill that President Clinton's library had received a $450,000 contribution from the ex-wife of Marc Rich, who had fled the country to evade $40 million in taxes. So these types of things have certainly raised concern. In 2013, the Sunlight Foundation's policy director endorsed my bill during a hearing on Federal Government transparency in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, saying: ``It would provide valuable information on special interests whose donations put them in close proximity with Presidents.'' {time} 1715 Presidential libraries were once modest structures, but they have grown rapidly over the years into megamuseums devoted to a President's life and legacy. President George W. Bush's library topped $500 million in costs. That is seven times the cost of his father's library. A recent report in The New York Times noted that President Obama's library could end up costing $1 billion. As costs soar, clearly there is potential for abuse, no matter who is President. This is, as I said, not a partisan issue. It is not directed at any President. It is simply a good government bill that I think almost everyone can support, and certainly they have in the past. I urge support for this legislation. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I support this bill, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Representative Duncan and Ranking Member Cummings for sponsoring this legislation. Representative Duncan first sponsored a bill to improve Presidential libraries 16 years ago. What has happened that we can't get this bill through the Congress? I hope this bill this year will prove different. This Congress, I hope we can finally get this important reform on the President's desk where I am sure it will be signed. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act would provide transparency to the process for building Presidential libraries. The practice of creating a Presidential library began decades ago with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The tradition has carried on through every President since that time, and it is going to continue. Presidential libraries have become increasingly more expensive as they [[Page H249]] have evolved into multipurpose centers that do more than simply house Presidential records. For example, the William J. Clinton Library cost an estimated $165 million, while the George W. Bush Presidential Center cost an estimated $250 million to build, with President Bush having raised approximately half a billion dollars for his library, museum, and institute. We can expect that with each new President, these libraries are going to cost more. That is just natural. Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the identities of those who donate to a Presidential library, and a President is able to secure an unlimited amount of private donations while still in office. The bill before us would make a simple but very important change in existing law. Under this bill, organizations that raise money to build Presidential libraries would be required to disclose the identity of any individual who donates more than $200. It seems reasonable to me, Mr. Speaker. The National Archives and Records Administration would then be required to post the donation information in a manner that is free to access and downloadable. Additionally, this legislation would create criminal penalties for individuals who report false information on donations and for fundraising organizations that omit donation information. A group of 15 good government organizations, including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the Sunlight Foundation, sent a letter urging the House to support this bill. Here is what they wrote: ``Under the current opaque system, Presidents raise funds privately to establish their Presidential libraries. These efforts, which often begin long before they leave office, are unregulated and undisclosed, creating opportunities for, or the appearance of, influence-peddling. Improved transparency would help reduce the appearance of impropriety and help deter inappropriate behavior.'' The appearance is just as important as the behavior itself, I emphasize, Mr. Speaker. This bill was approved without opposition by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in March and has passed the House several times before. As I noted, companion legislation sponsored by Senators Corker and Johnson was approved by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee earlier this year. It looks like this bill may become law after all, Mr. Duncan. I urge every Member of this body to support transparency by voting for this important legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I urge its passage. It is high time that this passed. It is bipartisan, it is bicameral, and it is done with some good leadership from Mr. Duncan. I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1069, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H247-H249] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATION REFORM ACT OF 2016 Mr. CHAFFETZ.

This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES.

SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED. No additional funds are authorized to carry out the requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan), the gentleman who has championed this issue as the prime sponsor. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Chaffetz for his support and for yielding me this time. This is a bill that has passed in three separate Congresses with overwhelming bipartisan support and very, very little opposition. In fact, in this Congress, it is cosponsored by Ranking Member Elijah Cummings. In past Congresses, it has been cosponsored by Ranking Member Edolphus Towns; and in one Congress, Chairman Waxman became the primary sponsor. So it is a very bipartisan bill. It is a very simple bill, one that I think can be supported by anyone who is opposed to secrecy in government and believes in an open, transparent system. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act simply requires that donations to a President's library greater than $200 be disclosed to the public and posted online. It is very surprising to people that there are no laws governing these donations at this time. In fact, any person, corporation, or foreign government can donate any amount, unreported, while a President is still in office.

TITLE II--SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREAN PROLIFERATION, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, ILLICIT ACTIVITIES, AND SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES UNDERMINING CYBER SECURITY SEC. 201. DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA AS A JURISDICTION OF PRIMARY MONEY LAUNDERING CONCERN. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Undersecretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who is responsible for safeguarding the financial system against illicit use, money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, has repeatedly expressed concern about North Korea's misuse of the international financial system as follows: (A) In 2006, the Undersecretary stated that, given North Korea's ``counterfeiting of U.S. currency, narcotics trafficking and use of accounts worldwide to conduct proliferation-related transactions, the line between illicit and licit North Korean money is nearly invisible'' and urged financial institutions worldwide to ``think carefully about the risks of doing any North Korea-related business.''. [[Page H232]] (B) In 2011, the Undersecretary stated that ``North Korea remains intent on engaging in proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing in material,'' and was ``aggressively pursuing the effort to establish front companies.''. (C) In 2013, the Undersecretary stated, in reference to North Korea's distribution of high-quality counterfeit United States currency, that ``North Korea is continuing to try to pass a supernote into the international financial system,'' and that the Department of the Treasury would soon introduce new currency with improved security features to protect against counterfeiting by the Government of North Korea. (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, has repeatedly-- (A) expressed concern at deficiencies in North Korea's regimes to combat money laundering and terrorist financing; (B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of action to address significant deficiencies in these regimes and the serious threat they pose to the integrity of the international financial system; (C) urged all jurisdictions to apply countermeasures to protect the international financial system from ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing risks emanating from North Korea; (D) urged all jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with North Korea, including North Korean companies and financial institutions; and (E) called on all jurisdictions to protect against correspondent relationships being used to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk mitigation practices, and take into account money laundering and terrorist financing risks when considering requests by North Korean financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in their jurisdiction. (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which-- (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's recommendation on financial sanctions related to proliferation, and its guidance on the implementation of sanctions; (B) decided that Member States should apply enhanced monitoring and other legal measures to prevent the provision of financial services or the transfer of property that could contribute to activities prohibited by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; and (C) called on Member States to prohibit North Korean banks from establishing or maintaining correspondent relationships with banks in their jurisdictions, to prevent the provision of financial services, if they have information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that these activities could contribute to activities prohibited by an applicable United Nations Security Council resolution, or to the evasion of such prohibitions. (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North Korea as a Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering Concern.--Congress-- (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to impose limitations on, and require enhanced monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities; (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms, to immediately designate North Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, and to adopt stringent special measures to safeguard the financial system against the risks posed by North Korea's willful evasion of sanctions and its illicit activities; and (3) urges the President to seek the prompt implementation by other states of enhanced monitoring and due diligence to prevent North Korea's misuse of the international financial system, including by sharing information about activities, transactions, and property that could contribute to activities sanctioned by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions, or to the evasion of sanctions. (c) Determinations Regarding North Korea.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, determine, in consultation with the Secretary of State and Attorney General, and in accordance with section 5318A of title 31, United States Code, whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. (2) Special measures.--If the Secretary of the Treasury determines under this subsection that reasonable grounds exist for finding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal functional regulators, shall impose one or more of the special measures described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 5318A(b) of title 31, United States Code, with respect to the jurisdiction of North Korea. (3) Report required.-- (A) In general.--If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary makes such determination, submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the determination made under paragraph (1) together with the reasons for that determination. (B) Form.--A report or copy of any report submitted under this paragraph shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex. SEC. 202.

(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President should intensify diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate international fora such as the United Nations and bilaterally, to develop and implement a coordinated, consistent, multilateral strategy for protecting the global financial system against risks emanating from North Korea, including-- (1) the cessation of any financial services whose continuation is inconsistent with applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; (2) the cessation of any financial services to persons, including financial institutions, that present unacceptable risks of facilitating money laundering and illicit activity by the Government of North Korea; (3) the blocking by all states and jurisdictions, in accordance with the legal process of the state or jurisdiction in which the property is held, of any property required to be blocked under applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; (4) the blocking of any property derived from illicit activity, from significant activities undermining cyber security, from the misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement of public funds by, or for the benefit of, officials of the Government of North Korea; (5) the blocking of any property involved in significant activities undermining cyber security by the Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly, against United States persons, or the theft of intellectual property by the Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly from United States persons; and (6) the blocking of any property of persons directly or indirectly involved in censorship or human rights abuses by the Government of North Korea.

General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Leader McCarthy working with myself, working with Ranking Member Eliot Engel of New York to schedule this legislation for floor consideration. Last week, North Korea conducted its fourth known nuclear test. The Kim regime has developed increasingly destructive weapons. What we are concerned about here is the miniaturization of nuclear warheads that fit onto its most reliable missiles. We are also concerned about the submarine tests for firing from a sub these missiles that would be capable of launching those devices. We are concerned about the ongoing efforts to make certain that they have got the range now on a three-stage rocket, ICBM, to hit the United States. This threat is unacceptable, and it has to be aggressively challenged. The legislation that we are considering here is the most comprehensive North Korea sanctions legislation to come before this body. Importantly, what this bill does is use targeted financial and economic pressure to isolate Kim Jong-un and his top officials from the assets that they maintain in foreign banks and from the hard currency that sustains their rule. These assets are derived primarily from illicit activities, such as counterfeiting U.S. currency, something that North Korea has been caught doing with hundred-dollar bank notes, such as selling their missile systems around the world, contraband in cigarettes, drugs, and other illicit activities. And all of that is used to advance North Korea's nuclear program. They also pay for the luxurious lifestyle of the ruling elites, as we have seen in some of the exposes that come out of North Korea, and it is used to repress the people. In other words, the money from that hard currency pays for the generals, pays for the secret police, pays for the missile program and the nuclear weapons program. A strategy of financial pressure is the approach we took a decade ago when the previous administration targeted Banco Delta Asia. That was a Macao-based bank. This was in 2005. They were targeted for their role in laundering money for North Korea, and this cut it off from the financial system, really. This led other banks in the region to shun North Korean business, because when the option is out there between whether or not you are going to bank with North Korea or bank with the U.S. and the rest of the world, it is a fairly easy choice for these banks to make. At that point, they freeze the accounts, and that, obviously, isolates the regime. At that time, according to one former top U.S. official who was speaking to the issue of what the North Koreans would say when they would come into the meetings with the State Department, at every conversation we had with the North Koreans, he said, every one of them began and ended with the same question: ``When do we get our money back?'' Now, the part that got my interest at the time was not only the report that, because he couldn't pay his generals, there were problems for the regime--it is not a good position for a dictator to be in--but also that missile production [[Page H236]] lines had come to a halt because they couldn't buy on the black market; they didn't have the hard currency anymore to do it, the parts that they needed for their programs. Unfortunately, the pressure at the time was lifted. I think it was lifted prematurely for certain because the representation was made that Kim Jong Il was going to make concessions on his nuclear program, concessions that ultimately were never made. From my standpoint, what a mistake. From the standpoint of the people I talk to over at Treasury, what a mistake. They had a different vision on how those sanctions should be maintained. Today, the Obama administration has let its North Korea policy drift. A year ago, it promised a proportional response to the massive cyber terrorist attack against the United States. But to date, the administration's response has been dangerously weak. A mere 18 low- level arms dealers have been sanctioned. That has been it. Failing to respond to North Korea's belligerence, I think, only emboldens their leader. Disrupting North Korea's illicit activities will place tremendous strain on that country's ruling elite who have so brutalized the people of North Korea. I spoke to the defector who used to run their propaganda machinery about this. He defected through China. And he discussed this issue. He said: Look, that hard currency goes, not to the people; it goes for the military apparatus and the political apparatus of the regime. So we have got to go after those illicit activities like we went after organized crime in the United States: identify the network, interdict shipments, disrupt the flow of money. North Korea, after all, has been called a ``gangster regime.'' You have seen that term in the press. Well, it is pretty apt. This regime is a critical threat, frankly, to our national security. Under this bill's framework, anyone laundering money, counterfeiting goods, smuggling, or trafficking narcotics will be subject to significant sanctions. It is also important to remember the deplorable state of human rights in North Korea. Two years ago, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry released the most comprehensive report on North Korea to date, finding that the Kim regime ``has for decades,'' in their words, ``pursued policies involving crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.'' So this bill requires the State Department to use this report's findings to identify the individuals responsible for these abuses and to press for more ways in which to get information into North Korea so as to move the attitudes of the population inside the country. Mr. Speaker, a return to the strategy of effective financial pressure on North Korea is our best bet to end North Korea's threat to its own people, to our South Korean allies, and ultimately to us. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, February 26, 2015. Hon.

I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 757 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this measure. I want to first thank our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, for authoring this very good, bipartisan bill. I am very pleased to be the lead Democratic cosponsor. I think this is an important bill, and it ties in with what we have tried to do for these past years on the Foreign Affairs Committee, being bipartisan and letting politics stop at the water's edge when we are talking about international affairs. Mr. Speaker, last week's nuclear test in North Korea was a stark reminder of just how dangerous the Kim regime is. A nuclear weapon in the hands of a rogue power is a threat to peace and stability around the world. North Korea continues to have a destabilizing influence on the peninsula and across the region, and the potential for nuclear fuel from North Korea to end up on the black market in the hands of violent extremists only compounds the threat. Yet, despite the burden of some of the toughest sanctions imaginable, despite constant pressure from the global community, despite the increasing isolation of North Korea from the rest of the world, leaders in Pyongyang persist on this dangerous and destabilizing course. The latest test demands a response. We need to work with our allies, particularly South Korea and Japan. We need to make sure this issue is at the top of the agenda in our engagement with China. China can have a lot of influence and does have a lot of influence over North Korea. We need to act unilaterally to make clear to the North Koreans that their actions have consequences. This bill would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. Let me say I am very proud, again, in a bipartisan way, this bill passed unanimously out of the Foreign Affairs Committee. North Korea has become more and more savvy at evading sanctions, and that is why this bill broadens our sanctions. The country's elites do business with shell companies and cover up the money trail. This allows hard currency to flow into North Korea. This bill would crack down on this practice and go after anyone helping prop up the Kim regime through these illegal activities. I must say that I have been to North Korea twice, to Pyongyang twice. We watched in the morning when people were going to work. The elites do very well there. It is just the rest of the country that is starving. This bill would include the important exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the North Korean people. We help them with food aid. We are the most generous country with feeding North Korea. It is important to point this out because our quarrel is not with the North Korean people. It is with the despot and his aides that run North Korea. We know that the people of North Korea endure deplorable treatment at the hands of a corrupt regime. I can tell you the country's citizens deserve much, much better. That is why we will keep up the pressure on North Korea's leaders and that is why we need to pass this legislation. I urge a ``yes'' vote. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding. I rise in strong support of H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, there is a compelling need to pass tough and effective legislation to freeze the assets of the Kim Jong-un regime. I want to commend Chairman Royce for his long and hard work on North Korea and his determination to bring this bill to the floor. I again thank Ranking Member Eliot Engel for his good, strong sense of bipartisanship. This is a one-two punch against a cruel dictatorship, and this legislation has to get to the President as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, whether it be North Korea or Iran, when will we learn the hard lesson that totalitarian states do not negotiate in good faith, cannot be trusted to hold up their end of the bargain, and use our goodwill and our foreign capital to keep on proliferating? They will not allow intrusive inspections because they cheat and because it weakens their status at home. They use nuclear weapons negotiations to [[Page H238]] enhance their own diplomatic status and to gain concessions. In the end, nuclear negotiations earn rogue nations like Iran and North Korea foreign capital and other investments from the West. They use that to fund additional missile technology, to fund criminal and terrorist activities, and to continue with clandestine nuclear programs. During the Bush administration, the most effective tools in bringing the North Korea dictatorship to heel were the freezing of its assets in the Banco Delta Asia in Macao and the building of an international coalition to interdict suspect North Korea shipping. These should be our priorities now, especially in the shadow of North Korea's nuclear tests, by imposing mandatory sanctions on the perpetrators of human rights abuses, censorship, arms and human trafficking, money laundering, as well proliferation. Nearly 2 years ago, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry reported that the ongoing crimes against humanity in North Korea have no ``parallel in the contemporary world.'' These crimes include ``extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, and racial, and grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons, and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.'' {time} 1615 Kim Jong-un cares not at all about the welfare of his own people. We should expect that he cares even less about the welfare of the people of Japan, South Korea, or even U.S. citizens who face the threat of North Korean nuclear weapons. The U.N. Commission recommended that the U.N. impose targeted sanctions on the North Korean leaders responsible for its human rights crimes. However, China blocks U.N. action. Without U.N. action, the U.S. must act, using our position as the steward of the global financial system. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on North Korea welcomes such action, supporting targeted sanctions of those most responsible for these heinous crimes against humanity. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my friend and colleague and a valued member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from New York, the distinguished ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. I rise today in support of the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their leadership in bringing this legislation before us. I especially appreciate the inclusion of two of my amendments, one to provide for the reunification of Korean families separated by the 38th parallel, and another to ensure that U.S. policy toward North Korea is informed by the recommendations made in the landmark Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea conducted by the United Nations. Amidst the tense geopolitical standoffs and irresponsible actions of the North Korean regime, we must always remember the human cost of this enduring conflict. I believe this bill, through these amendments and important exceptions to sanctions for humanitarian relief organizations, does just that. This is timely, if not overdue, legislation. North Korea is a reckless, paranoid state devoid of virtually all aspects of human autonomy, now armed with a nuclear umbrella. That makes the Korean peninsula one of the most dangerous flash points on the globe. There have been recent developments in North Korea that are profoundly troubling and deserve an immediate response from this Congress. Reports that North Korea has conducted its fourth nuclear weapons test confirm that the regime in Pyongyang is committed to defying international norms and risks destabilizing the entire Asia- Pacific region. As co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, I remain deeply concerned with the volatility and the ever-present potential of conflict on the Korean Peninsula. It is a specter that looms over 75 million Koreans and, for their sake and that of the region, the U.S., the Republic of Korea, China, and other regional stakeholders must demonstrate commitment to addressing this threat. By targeting the individuals and entities that support the Kim regime through illicit activities, this bill will hopefully weaken the resolve and capability of Pyongyang to endanger regional stability. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is also an original cosponsor with me on this legislation. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this piece of legislation up to the House floor. Mr. Speaker, North Korea is a world threat, a nuclear world threat. Its leaders are outlaws with no redeeming social character in their souls, and we need to operate with them knowing this. Last week, North Korea tested another nuclear weapon. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, I held a hearing in October and predicted that this test would happen again. With Iran about to receive hundreds of billions of dollars for its illegal nuclear program, we shouldn't be surprised that North Korea wants a piece of the pie, too. Illegal nuclear programs and material can bring a lot of money to a regime. In the hearing that we had in October, we learned of deep connections between Iran and North Korea. Both nations, among other things, sponsor worldwide terror. They have a history of working together on missile development. There is mounting evidence that they have worked together on their nuclear weapons programs as well. We should expect Iran to keep working with North Korea to advance its own nuclear weapons program. We have sanctions on North Korea, but all those sanctions have not been fully implemented. The administration's policy of strategic patience is not working because this barbaric regime continues to develop nuclear weapons and ICBMs. I say our patience has run out in dealing with them. This bill is Congress showing North Korea that there are consequences for their testing of nuclear weapons. We cannot let North Korea develop its nuclear program even more. North Korea already has submarines with missiles on them that can reach the United States, over 10 nuclear bombs, and for some reason has Austin on its hit list. I take that personally, Mr. Speaker, that Austin is their number one target in the United States. North Korea is a state that imprisons Christians for their faith, starves its citizens, controls the Internet and the media, tortures anyone in its domain who dares to disagree with the regime, and is engaged in cyberterrorism. Dangerous actions by a ruthless dictator must be met by forceful responses. I am glad to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I urge its passage. It is time for them to pay the price for going rogue. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard), our colleague on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a rising star in our committee. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I am rising today in strong support of H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act, which I am proud to be a cosponsor of. North Korea continues to pose a serious and dangerous threat to my constituents in Hawaii, the Pacific, and the West Coast of the United States. Our communities and our families lie within range of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles. North Korea's nuclear tests just a week ago and their continued pursuit of developing more nuclear weapons and miniaturizing those weapons serve as a reminder of the threat that North Korea poses to our country, which my constituents in Hawaii know all too well. There are some necessary steps that the United States must take to deal with this threat: We need to increase the strength and capabilities of our Pacific fleet and forces. We need to stop [[Page H239]] the downward trend in investment of ballistic missile defense development and capabilities, and strengthen our ballistic missile defense capabilities, specifically in Hawaii and the Pacific, to counter this threat. We need to completely reexamine our strategy of so-called strategic patience with North Korea, recognizing that North Korea has continued to grow in their nuclear and missile capabilities, telling us that the status quo is not working. This bill, however, deals with another important area where we need to act, and that is sanctions. It gives us the tools to respond to North Korea's provocations. One provision would apply sanctions that prohibit the export of munitions to North Korea and severely restrict export licenses for controlled goods and technologies. It would prohibit financial transactions between U.S. persons and the Government of North Korea and sanction those who send or receive lethal military equipment to or from North Korea. The bill will also give us the tools to reapply some of the most effective sanctions that we have ever had against hard currency for those who do business with North Korea. We saw how these sanctions were effective before. Following U.S. action against the Banco Delta Asia based in Macao in 2005, the assets of North Korean banks and leaders were frozen and completely blocked from the international financial system. This directly affected the money being used to develop these nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, and the money also supported the regime's leadership and its elites and their lifestyle. This severely increased the pressure in North Korea, causing them to engage with the international community, coming to an agreement to lift the sanctions in 2007--prematurely, in my view--made in exchange for shutting down and sealing the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and discussing a list of its nuclear-related activities with the U.S. and other parties in the region. The agreement was violated by North Korea in 2009 when they tested a missile, and the sanctions on Banco Delta showed us earlier a way to impact North Korean leadership and business directly. Those sanctions should have been immediately reinstated upon North Korea breaking that agreement, but that is why we are here today--to act. While sanctions alone are not enough, this bill could provide some very important tools to countering North Korea's aggression and ultimately achieving our objective of a denuclearized North Korea. Lastly, this bill recognizes the terrible human rights abuses inflicted on the people of North Korea. For many years, State Department human rights reports, as well as private organizations' reports, have depicted a pattern of extreme human rights abuses by the tyrannical North Korean regime, including the denial of basic human freedoms: withheld access to food and deplorable prison camps where extrajudicial killings, enslavement, torture, and sexual abuse are widespread. I would like to thank our Chairman Royce and our Ranking Member Engel for their steadfast, bipartisan dedication and leadership to taking action on this global and domestic security issue. This bill provides a critical step forward. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and author of multiple North Korea human rights and sanctions laws. She is also a cosponsor of this bill. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud and pleased to be here speaking on behalf of this bill, H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act. I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for introducing this important bill which, once again, is presented in their usual bipartisan manner. While initial reports, Mr. Speaker, cast doubt on North Korea's claims that it carried out a hydrogen bomb test, any enhancement of the regime's nuclear capability should be--must be--a cause for concern. Both U.S. and South Korean intelligence assessments indicate that North Korea already possesses the capability to install a nuclear warhead on a missile that can reach United States territory or that of our allies. Despite some doubt about that capability's effectiveness, it is just a matter of time before North Korea finishes developing this dangerous technology that it is seeking or, worse, shares this technology with Iran, as these two rogue regimes are bosom buddies and have long been known to collaborate on their ballistic missile programs. What is clear is that our current policy toward North Korea is not working. Administrations from both parties, Mr. Speaker, have made mistakes with North Korea over the years. They have failed to respond to North Korea's violation of its nuclear deal and have failed to hold the regime accountable for its illicit activity. Administration after administration have removed North Korea off the State Sponsors of Terrorism list and continue to keep the regime off that list despite mounting evidence that would support its inclusion back on the terrorism list. Various administrations have utterly failed to enforce the North Korea sanctions that we already have on the books. The Obama administration's so-called strategic patience policy with North Korea has proven to be a disaster, and it is time that we fully and vigorously enforce the existing sanctions and expand upon those to implement new sanctions on Pyongyang until its nuclear program is dismantled. By some estimates, North Korea might already have 10 to 15 nuclear weapons, and Kim Jong-un has shown that he will stop at nothing to get the weapons and the technology that he desires. This bill would help ensure that our sanctions on North Korea are finally being enforced the way they always should have been, but we can't forget that North Korea cannot make progress on its nuclear program alone. North Korea has a long history of collaborating with other rogue regimes, and we must ensure that we are enforcing sanctions on all of its collaborators. Any government entity or individual that has sold or transferred weapons or technology to North Korea in violation of U.S. law or U.N. Security Council resolution should also be targeted for sanctions. Mr. Speaker, I will end with this note: North Korea has been writing the playbook for rogue regimes to follow, and unless this administration gets serious about confronting Pyongyang's aggressions, I worry that it will continue to allow Iran to take advantage of us, that we won't enforce sanctions on Tehran, just like we are not enforcing them on North Korea. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. In a few years' time, we will be back here debating what to do after another nuclear device test by North Korea, by Iran, or by other rogue actors. North Korea poses an imminent threat now to our security as well as that of our allies. We cannot afford to ignore it nor look the other way. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this important bill and urge its passage. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for this bill. {time} 1630 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Colleagues, a nuclear weapon in the hands of North Korea, a rogue, destabilizing country on the peninsula and across the region, is simply a nonstarter. It is unthinkable. Despite our tough sanctions and increasing isolation from the global community, Pyongyang continues down a dangerous and destabilizing course. Last week's nuclear test in North Korea is a jarring reminder of just how dangerous the Kim regime is and demands a response from the United States and our allies as well. We must work with South Korea and Japan to make sure this issue is at the top of our agenda in our engagement with China. We must act unilaterally to make sure to North Koreans that their leadership's actions have consequences. H.R. 757 would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. The bill [[Page H240]] would crack down on North Korean elite who do business through shell companies to evade detection and go after anyone helping to prop up the Kim regime through illegal activities. This bill would include important exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the North Korean people. North Koreans deserve much more than what its leaders are providing, which is why we need to pass this legislation. We cannot allow North Korea to continue to be dangerous and frivolous. We have to stand up and say no. They have to understand that we mean business. They have to understand that what they have done is unacceptable and will not stand. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We have the opportunity today to show Americans and the world that Congress is willing to lead on this vital national security issue. This is an issue that Congress has been focused on, obviously, for some time. I have spent much of my time on the Foreign Affairs Committee focused on the North Korean threat. Ranking Member Eliot Engel and I, in one of our first trips together as chairman and ranking member of the committee, traveled to visit our South Korean ally and toured the wreckage of the Cheonan. This was a corvette ship that was hit and split right in half by a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine, costing the lives of 46 sailors. It is a reminder of the attitude that North Korea has in terms of its provocative action. Both Eliot Engel and I have been to North Korea on separate trips, and we can tell you it is a totalitarian state with an ever-present cult of personalities. If you have ever read Orwell's book, ``Nineteen Eighty-Four,'' the society in that book seemed almost more rational than this police state. I was talking to the former Minister of Propaganda. In the no-go areas, 1.9 million were starved to death in North Korea. You ask why. Well, with the paranoia of the police state, they are not considered particularly loyal out there. Besides, the food can be sold on the food exchange in the capital for hard currency. Donated food often is used in this way to support what he calls ``juche,'' to support this philosophy which leads them forward with this desire to have a nuclear weapon and the capability to deliver it. This bipartisan bill, which I authored with Eliot Engel as our principal coauthor, is based on legislation that unanimously passed the House last Congress. Its implementation will help sever a key subsidy for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program, for only when the North Korean leadership realizes that its criminal activities are untenable do prospects for peace and security in Northeast Asia improve. This bill will return us to the one strategy that has worked to pressure North Korea at a time when Kim Jong-un is trying to blackmail his way to consolidating power. Congress must send the message to the Kim regime that they can either reform and disarm or the system can implode. Without hard currency, without being able to pay the generals, that system would implode. By cutting off Kim Jong-un's access to the hard currency he needs for his army and his weapons, this bill, H.R. 757, will squarely present the North Korean regime with that choice. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, recent news of North Korea's claim that it successfully conducted an H-bomb test for the first time, in defiance of United Nations' resolutions ups the ante on why we must remain steadfast in expediently addressing insecurity in our nation and across the globe, as anticipated in this bill by Representative Royce of California, entitled the North Korean Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2,315 which has enjoyed bi-partisan support. Our world today is faced with resurgent and evolving threats from weapons of mass destruction to destructive nuclear ambitions. Indeed, news events inform us of the far-ranging spectrum we must contend with, ranging from persistent nation state-based dangerous nuclear ambitions in North Korea, to continued chemical weapons used in Syria, to terrorist organizations such as Daesh ramping up their destructive capabilities through vitriolic recruitment strategies, that pose an existential threat beyond the borders from which ISIS is operating. I am confident that these are issues that President Obama will be addressing and proposing durable solutions to during his last state of the Union Address as our nation's Commander In Chief. Under his leadership, our nation has achieved foreign policy feats that have worked to maintain our security, promote our geopolitical objectives and advance our diplomatic relationships with key allies. Let's just take a quick look back at some of the President's foreign policy achievements: The capture and neutralization of Osama Bin Laden which brought an end to a nearly decade long manhunt. The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq which helped to bring an end to a costly war, helping our country save billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer funds. The current Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has been instrumental in deterring and stemming Iran's nuclear ambitions and enabling security in the global society. The repealing of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, an aspersion on the personal private matters of those who have dedicated their lives to protect our nation. Signing into law the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), an important treaty that showcases how the U.S. leads by example by signing a treaty that requires both the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear warhead arsenals to 1,550 each, a 30 percent reduction from the 2002 Treaty of Moscow and a 74 percent reduction from the 1991 START treaty. Neutralization of al Qaeda propagandist and foreign fighter recruiter Anwar Al Awlaki, one of the main leaders in the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Indeed, under President Obama's leadership, our country's military aid to Israel has increased remarkably with the eye towards deepening and expanding U.S./Israeli relations-an important aspect of our nation's foreign policy and geopolitical efforts to promote peace in the region. This president's foreign policy achievements in promoting the security of our nation are irrefutable and this is why I support the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2015 because it will empower him to continue his impressive work in this arena. Much like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) championed by this Administration, this bill encourages our President to investigate any credible information of sanctionable activities involving North Korea. Furthermore, this bill will designate and implement sanctions against persons and entities who knowingly engage in or contribute to activities in North Korea whether it is through their exporting or importing of weapons of mass destruction, significant arms, significant luxury goods, money laundering, censorship, or engage in human rights abuses. Pursuant to the bill, the President is empowered to exercise authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as it relates to persons, entities and the government of North Korea. This bill empowers our President with discretionary authority to designate and apply sanctions to persons involved in certain other kinds of conduct. This bill will facilitate civil forfeiture of assets, real or personal, if said properties inure from any attempted or actual violation of this Act, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to such a violation. Other core provisions of the bill is the empowerment of our Treasury Secretary to: determine whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern; and In the event our Treasury Secretary makes this determination, he is empowered to impose one or more special measures with respect to the jurisdiction of North Korea. Finally, our sense of Congress in this bill is in comity with and ensures the consistent enforcement of United Nations Security Council resolutions and financial restrictions on North Korea. Through this bill, our president will be empowered to withhold assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to any country that provides lethal military equipment to, or receives it from the government of North Korea. This bill is also important because it will put into place an enhanced screening procedure whereby our Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) will be able to determine if physical inspections are warranted of any cargo bound for or landed in the United States that has been transported through a foreign seaport or airport whose inspections are deficient if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such cargo contains goods prohibited under this Act. [[Page H241]] This will facilitate expedient seizure of vessels or aircraft used to facilitate sanctionable activities. The President will also be supported in his efforts to produce progress reports on significant activities undermining cyber security conflicted, or otherwise ordered or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the government of North Korea. Our Secretary of State will be supported in his human rights efforts of reporting on each political prison camp in North Korea, which will include a detailed description of those abuses or censorship. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for championing this bill and look forward to working with him and other members of this House in promoting our national security and supporting our President's objective of establishing us as a credible and trusted leader in the global landscape. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 757, as amended.

Congress finds the following: (1) The Government of North Korea has repeatedly violated its commitments to the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear weapons programs, and has willfully violated multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for it to cease its development, testing, and production of weapons of mass destruction. (2) North Korea poses a grave risk for the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. (3) The Government of North Korea has been implicated repeatedly in money laundering and illicit activities, including prohibited arms sales, narcotics trafficking, the counterfeiting of United States currency, and the counterfeiting of intellectual property of United States persons. (4) The Government of North Korea has, both historically and recently, repeatedly sponsored acts of international terrorism, including attempts to assassinate defectors and human rights activists, repeated threats of violence against foreign persons, leaders, newspapers, and cities, and the shipment of weapons to terrorists and state sponsors of terrorism. (5) North Korea has unilaterally withdrawn from the 1953 Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War, and committed provocations against South Korea in 2010 by sinking the warship Cheonan and killing 46 of her crew, and by shelling Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans. (6) North Korea maintains a system of brutal political prison camps that contain as many as 120,000 men, women, and children, who live in atrocious living conditions with insufficient food, clothing, and medical care, and under constant fear of torture or arbitrary execution. (7) The Congress reaffirms the purposes of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 contained in section 4 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 7802). (8) North Korea has prioritized weapons programs and the procurement of luxury goods, in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and in gross disregard of the needs of its people. (9) The President has determined that the Government of North Korea is responsible for knowingly engaging in significant activities undermining cyber security with respect to United States persons and interests, and for threats of violence against the civilian population of the United States. (10) Persons, including financial institutions, who engage in transactions with, or provide financial services to, the Government of North Korea and its financial institutions without establishing sufficient financial safeguards against North Korea's use of these transactions to promote proliferation, weapons trafficking, human rights violations, illicit activity, and the purchase of luxury goods, aid and abet North Korea's misuse of the international financial system, and also violate the intent of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. [[Page H230]] (11) The Government of North Korea's conduct poses an imminent threat to the security of the United States and its allies, to the global economy, to the safety of members of the United States Armed Forces, to the integrity of the global financial system, to the integrity of global nonproliferation programs, and to the people of North Korea. (12) The Congress seeks, through this legislation, to use nonmilitary means to address this crisis, to provide diplomatic leverage to negotiate necessary changes in North Korea's conduct, and to ease the suffering of the people of North Korea.

TITLE II--SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREAN PROLIFERATION, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, ILLICIT ACTIVITIES, AND SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES UNDERMINING CYBER SECURITY SEC. 201. DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA AS A JURISDICTION OF PRIMARY MONEY LAUNDERING CONCERN. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Undersecretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who is responsible for safeguarding the financial system against illicit use, money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, has repeatedly expressed concern about North Korea's misuse of the international financial system as follows: (A) In 2006, the Undersecretary stated that, given North Korea's ``counterfeiting of U.S. currency, narcotics trafficking and use of accounts worldwide to conduct proliferation-related transactions, the line between illicit and licit North Korean money is nearly invisible'' and urged financial institutions worldwide to ``think carefully about the risks of doing any North Korea-related business.''. [[Page H232]] (B) In 2011, the Undersecretary stated that ``North Korea remains intent on engaging in proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing in material,'' and was ``aggressively pursuing the effort to establish front companies.''. (C) In 2013, the Undersecretary stated, in reference to North Korea's distribution of high-quality counterfeit United States currency, that ``North Korea is continuing to try to pass a supernote into the international financial system,'' and that the Department of the Treasury would soon introduce new currency with improved security features to protect against counterfeiting by the Government of North Korea. (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, has repeatedly-- (A) expressed concern at deficiencies in North Korea's regimes to combat money laundering and terrorist financing; (B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of action to address significant deficiencies in these regimes and the serious threat they pose to the integrity of the international financial system; (C) urged all jurisdictions to apply countermeasures to protect the international financial system from ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing risks emanating from North Korea; (D) urged all jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with North Korea, including North Korean companies and financial institutions; and (E) called on all jurisdictions to protect against correspondent relationships being used to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk mitigation practices, and take into account money laundering and terrorist financing risks when considering requests by North Korean financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in their jurisdiction. (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which-- (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's recommendation on financial sanctions related to proliferation, and its guidance on the implementation of sanctions; (B) decided that Member States should apply enhanced monitoring and other legal measures to prevent the provision of financial services or the transfer of property that could contribute to activities prohibited by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; and (C) called on Member States to prohibit North Korean banks from establishing or maintaining correspondent relationships with banks in their jurisdictions, to prevent the provision of financial services, if they have information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that these activities could contribute to activities prohibited by an applicable United Nations Security Council resolution, or to the evasion of such prohibitions. (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North Korea as a Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering Concern.--Congress-- (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to impose limitations on, and require enhanced monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities; (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms, to immediately designate North Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, and to adopt stringent special measures to safeguard the financial system against the risks posed by North Korea's willful evasion of sanctions and its illicit activities; and (3) urges the President to seek the prompt implementation by other states of enhanced monitoring and due diligence to prevent North Korea's misuse of the international financial system, including by sharing information about activities, transactions, and property that could contribute to activities sanctioned by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions, or to the evasion of sanctions. (c) Determinations Regarding North Korea.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, determine, in consultation with the Secretary of State and Attorney General, and in accordance with section 5318A of title 31, United States Code, whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. (2) Special measures.--If the Secretary of the Treasury determines under this subsection that reasonable grounds exist for finding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal functional regulators, shall impose one or more of the special measures described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 5318A(b) of title 31, United States Code, with respect to the jurisdiction of North Korea. (3) Report required.-- (A) In general.--If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary makes such determination, submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the determination made under paragraph (1) together with the reasons for that determination. (B) Form.--A report or copy of any report submitted under this paragraph shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex. SEC. 202.

(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President should intensify diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate international fora such as the United Nations and bilaterally, to develop and implement a coordinated, consistent, multilateral strategy for protecting the global financial system against risks emanating from North Korea, including-- (1) the cessation of any financial services whose continuation is inconsistent with applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; (2) the cessation of any financial services to persons, including financial institutions, that present unacceptable risks of facilitating money laundering and illicit activity by the Government of North Korea; (3) the blocking by all states and jurisdictions, in accordance with the legal process of the state or jurisdiction in which the property is held, of any property required to be blocked under applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; (4) the blocking of any property derived from illicit activity, from significant activities undermining cyber security, from the misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement of public funds by, or for the benefit of, officials of the Government of North Korea; (5) the blocking of any property involved in significant activities undermining cyber security by the Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly, against United States persons, or the theft of intellectual property by the Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly from United States persons; and (6) the blocking of any property of persons directly or indirectly involved in censorship or human rights abuses by the Government of North Korea.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Leader McCarthy working with myself, working with Ranking Member Eliot Engel of New York to schedule this legislation for floor consideration. Last week, North Korea conducted its fourth known nuclear test. The Kim regime has developed increasingly destructive weapons. What we are concerned about here is the miniaturization of nuclear warheads that fit onto its most reliable missiles. We are also concerned about the submarine tests for firing from a sub these missiles that would be capable of launching those devices. We are concerned about the ongoing efforts to make certain that they have got the range now on a three-stage rocket, ICBM, to hit the United States. This threat is unacceptable, and it has to be aggressively challenged. The legislation that we are considering here is the most comprehensive North Korea sanctions legislation to come before this body. Importantly, what this bill does is use targeted financial and economic pressure to isolate Kim Jong-un and his top officials from the assets that they maintain in foreign banks and from the hard currency that sustains their rule. These assets are derived primarily from illicit activities, such as counterfeiting U.S. currency, something that North Korea has been caught doing with hundred-dollar bank notes, such as selling their missile systems around the world, contraband in cigarettes, drugs, and other illicit activities. And all of that is used to advance North Korea's nuclear program. They also pay for the luxurious lifestyle of the ruling elites, as we have seen in some of the exposes that come out of North Korea, and it is used to repress the people. In other words, the money from that hard currency pays for the generals, pays for the secret police, pays for the missile program and the nuclear weapons program. A strategy of financial pressure is the approach we took a decade ago when the previous administration targeted Banco Delta Asia. That was a Macao-based bank. This was in 2005. They were targeted for their role in laundering money for North Korea, and this cut it off from the financial system, really. This led other banks in the region to shun North Korean business, because when the option is out there between whether or not you are going to bank with North Korea or bank with the U.S. and the rest of the world, it is a fairly easy choice for these banks to make. At that point, they freeze the accounts, and that, obviously, isolates the regime. At that time, according to one former top U.S. official who was speaking to the issue of what the North Koreans would say when they would come into the meetings with the State Department, at every conversation we had with the North Koreans, he said, every one of them began and ended with the same question: ``When do we get our money back?'' Now, the part that got my interest at the time was not only the report that, because he couldn't pay his generals, there were problems for the regime--it is not a good position for a dictator to be in--but also that missile production [[Page H236]] lines had come to a halt because they couldn't buy on the black market; they didn't have the hard currency anymore to do it, the parts that they needed for their programs. Unfortunately, the pressure at the time was lifted. I think it was lifted prematurely for certain because the representation was made that Kim Jong Il was going to make concessions on his nuclear program, concessions that ultimately were never made. From my standpoint, what a mistake. From the standpoint of the people I talk to over at Treasury, what a mistake. They had a different vision on how those sanctions should be maintained. Today, the Obama administration has let its North Korea policy drift. A year ago, it promised a proportional response to the massive cyber terrorist attack against the United States. But to date, the administration's response has been dangerously weak. A mere 18 low- level arms dealers have been sanctioned. That has been it. Failing to respond to North Korea's belligerence, I think, only emboldens their leader. Disrupting North Korea's illicit activities will place tremendous strain on that country's ruling elite who have so brutalized the people of North Korea. I spoke to the defector who used to run their propaganda machinery about this. He defected through China. And he discussed this issue. He said: Look, that hard currency goes, not to the people; it goes for the military apparatus and the political apparatus of the regime. So we have got to go after those illicit activities like we went after organized crime in the United States: identify the network, interdict shipments, disrupt the flow of money. North Korea, after all, has been called a ``gangster regime.'' You have seen that term in the press. Well, it is pretty apt. This regime is a critical threat, frankly, to our national security. Under this bill's framework, anyone laundering money, counterfeiting goods, smuggling, or trafficking narcotics will be subject to significant sanctions. It is also important to remember the deplorable state of human rights in North Korea. Two years ago, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry released the most comprehensive report on North Korea to date, finding that the Kim regime ``has for decades,'' in their words, ``pursued policies involving crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.'' So this bill requires the State Department to use this report's findings to identify the individuals responsible for these abuses and to press for more ways in which to get information into North Korea so as to move the attitudes of the population inside the country. Mr. Speaker, a return to the strategy of effective financial pressure on North Korea is our best bet to end North Korea's threat to its own people, to our South Korean allies, and ultimately to us. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, February 26, 2015. Hon.

I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this measure. I want to first thank our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, for authoring this very good, bipartisan bill. I am very pleased to be the lead Democratic cosponsor. I think this is an important bill, and it ties in with what we have tried to do for these past years on the Foreign Affairs Committee, being bipartisan and letting politics stop at the water's edge when we are talking about international affairs. Mr. Speaker, last week's nuclear test in North Korea was a stark reminder of just how dangerous the Kim regime is. A nuclear weapon in the hands of a rogue power is a threat to peace and stability around the world. North Korea continues to have a destabilizing influence on the peninsula and across the region, and the potential for nuclear fuel from North Korea to end up on the black market in the hands of violent extremists only compounds the threat. Yet, despite the burden of some of the toughest sanctions imaginable, despite constant pressure from the global community, despite the increasing isolation of North Korea from the rest of the world, leaders in Pyongyang persist on this dangerous and destabilizing course. The latest test demands a response. We need to work with our allies, particularly South Korea and Japan. We need to make sure this issue is at the top of the agenda in our engagement with China. China can have a lot of influence and does have a lot of influence over North Korea. We need to act unilaterally to make clear to the North Koreans that their actions have consequences. This bill would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. Let me say I am very proud, again, in a bipartisan way, this bill passed unanimously out of the Foreign Affairs Committee. North Korea has become more and more savvy at evading sanctions, and that is why this bill broadens our sanctions. The country's elites do business with shell companies and cover up the money trail. This allows hard currency to flow into North Korea. This bill would crack down on this practice and go after anyone helping prop up the Kim regime through these illegal activities. I must say that I have been to North Korea twice, to Pyongyang twice. We watched in the morning when people were going to work. The elites do very well there. It is just the rest of the country that is starving. This bill would include the important exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the North Korean people. We help them with food aid. We are the most generous country with feeding North Korea. It is important to point this out because our quarrel is not with the North Korean people. It is with the despot and his aides that run North Korea. We know that the people of North Korea endure deplorable treatment at the hands of a corrupt regime. I can tell you the country's citizens deserve much, much better. That is why we will keep up the pressure on North Korea's leaders and that is why we need to pass this legislation. I urge a ``yes'' vote. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding. I rise in strong support of H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, there is a compelling need to pass tough and effective legislation to freeze the assets of the Kim Jong-un regime. I want to commend Chairman Royce for his long and hard work on North Korea and his determination to bring this bill to the floor. I again thank Ranking Member Eliot Engel for his good, strong sense of bipartisanship. This is a one-two punch against a cruel dictatorship, and this legislation has to get to the President as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, whether it be North Korea or Iran, when will we learn the hard lesson that totalitarian states do not negotiate in good faith, cannot be trusted to hold up their end of the bargain, and use our goodwill and our foreign capital to keep on proliferating? They will not allow intrusive inspections because they cheat and because it weakens their status at home. They use nuclear weapons negotiations to [[Page H238]] enhance their own diplomatic status and to gain concessions. In the end, nuclear negotiations earn rogue nations like Iran and North Korea foreign capital and other investments from the West. They use that to fund additional missile technology, to fund criminal and terrorist activities, and to continue with clandestine nuclear programs. During the Bush administration, the most effective tools in bringing the North Korea dictatorship to heel were the freezing of its assets in the Banco Delta Asia in Macao and the building of an international coalition to interdict suspect North Korea shipping. These should be our priorities now, especially in the shadow of North Korea's nuclear tests, by imposing mandatory sanctions on the perpetrators of human rights abuses, censorship, arms and human trafficking, money laundering, as well proliferation. Nearly 2 years ago, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry reported that the ongoing crimes against humanity in North Korea have no ``parallel in the contemporary world.'' These crimes include ``extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, and racial, and grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons, and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.'' {time} 1615 Kim Jong-un cares not at all about the welfare of his own people. We should expect that he cares even less about the welfare of the people of Japan, South Korea, or even U.S. citizens who face the threat of North Korean nuclear weapons. The U.N. Commission recommended that the U.N. impose targeted sanctions on the North Korean leaders responsible for its human rights crimes. However, China blocks U.N. action. Without U.N. action, the U.S. must act, using our position as the steward of the global financial system. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on North Korea welcomes such action, supporting targeted sanctions of those most responsible for these heinous crimes against humanity. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my friend and colleague and a valued member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from New York, the distinguished ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. I rise today in support of the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their leadership in bringing this legislation before us. I especially appreciate the inclusion of two of my amendments, one to provide for the reunification of Korean families separated by the 38th parallel, and another to ensure that U.S. policy toward North Korea is informed by the recommendations made in the landmark Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea conducted by the United Nations. Amidst the tense geopolitical standoffs and irresponsible actions of the North Korean regime, we must always remember the human cost of this enduring conflict. I believe this bill, through these amendments and important exceptions to sanctions for humanitarian relief organizations, does just that. This is timely, if not overdue, legislation. North Korea is a reckless, paranoid state devoid of virtually all aspects of human autonomy, now armed with a nuclear umbrella. That makes the Korean peninsula one of the most dangerous flash points on the globe. There have been recent developments in North Korea that are profoundly troubling and deserve an immediate response from this Congress. Reports that North Korea has conducted its fourth nuclear weapons test confirm that the regime in Pyongyang is committed to defying international norms and risks destabilizing the entire Asia- Pacific region. As co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, I remain deeply concerned with the volatility and the ever-present potential of conflict on the Korean Peninsula. It is a specter that looms over 75 million Koreans and, for their sake and that of the region, the U.S., the Republic of Korea, China, and other regional stakeholders must demonstrate commitment to addressing this threat. By targeting the individuals and entities that support the Kim regime through illicit activities, this bill will hopefully weaken the resolve and capability of Pyongyang to endanger regional stability. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is also an original cosponsor with me on this legislation. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this piece of legislation up to the House floor. Mr. Speaker, North Korea is a world threat, a nuclear world threat. Its leaders are outlaws with no redeeming social character in their souls, and we need to operate with them knowing this. Last week, North Korea tested another nuclear weapon. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, I held a hearing in October and predicted that this test would happen again. With Iran about to receive hundreds of billions of dollars for its illegal nuclear program, we shouldn't be surprised that North Korea wants a piece of the pie, too. Illegal nuclear programs and material can bring a lot of money to a regime. In the hearing that we had in October, we learned of deep connections between Iran and North Korea. Both nations, among other things, sponsor worldwide terror. They have a history of working together on missile development. There is mounting evidence that they have worked together on their nuclear weapons programs as well. We should expect Iran to keep working with North Korea to advance its own nuclear weapons program. We have sanctions on North Korea, but all those sanctions have not been fully implemented. The administration's policy of strategic patience is not working because this barbaric regime continues to develop nuclear weapons and ICBMs. I say our patience has run out in dealing with them. This bill is Congress showing North Korea that there are consequences for their testing of nuclear weapons. We cannot let North Korea develop its nuclear program even more. North Korea already has submarines with missiles on them that can reach the United States, over 10 nuclear bombs, and for some reason has Austin on its hit list. I take that personally, Mr. Speaker, that Austin is their number one target in the United States. North Korea is a state that imprisons Christians for their faith, starves its citizens, controls the Internet and the media, tortures anyone in its domain who dares to disagree with the regime, and is engaged in cyberterrorism. Dangerous actions by a ruthless dictator must be met by forceful responses. I am glad to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I urge its passage. It is time for them to pay the price for going rogue. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard), our colleague on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a rising star in our committee. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I am rising today in strong support of H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act, which I am proud to be a cosponsor of. North Korea continues to pose a serious and dangerous threat to my constituents in Hawaii, the Pacific, and the West Coast of the United States. Our communities and our families lie within range of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles. North Korea's nuclear tests just a week ago and their continued pursuit of developing more nuclear weapons and miniaturizing those weapons serve as a reminder of the threat that North Korea poses to our country, which my constituents in Hawaii know all too well. There are some necessary steps that the United States must take to deal with this threat: We need to increase the strength and capabilities of our Pacific fleet and forces. We need to stop [[Page H239]] the downward trend in investment of ballistic missile defense development and capabilities, and strengthen our ballistic missile defense capabilities, specifically in Hawaii and the Pacific, to counter this threat. We need to completely reexamine our strategy of so-called strategic patience with North Korea, recognizing that North Korea has continued to grow in their nuclear and missile capabilities, telling us that the status quo is not working. This bill, however, deals with another important area where we need to act, and that is sanctions. It gives us the tools to respond to North Korea's provocations. One provision would apply sanctions that prohibit the export of munitions to North Korea and severely restrict export licenses for controlled goods and technologies. It would prohibit financial transactions between U.S. persons and the Government of North Korea and sanction those who send or receive lethal military equipment to or from North Korea. The bill will also give us the tools to reapply some of the most effective sanctions that we have ever had against hard currency for those who do business with North Korea. We saw how these sanctions were effective before. Following U.S. action against the Banco Delta Asia based in Macao in 2005, the assets of North Korean banks and leaders were frozen and completely blocked from the international financial system. This directly affected the money being used to develop these nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, and the money also supported the regime's leadership and its elites and their lifestyle. This severely increased the pressure in North Korea, causing them to engage with the international community, coming to an agreement to lift the sanctions in 2007--prematurely, in my view--made in exchange for shutting down and sealing the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and discussing a list of its nuclear-related activities with the U.S. and other parties in the region. The agreement was violated by North Korea in 2009 when they tested a missile, and the sanctions on Banco Delta showed us earlier a way to impact North Korean leadership and business directly. Those sanctions should have been immediately reinstated upon North Korea breaking that agreement, but that is why we are here today--to act. While sanctions alone are not enough, this bill could provide some very important tools to countering North Korea's aggression and ultimately achieving our objective of a denuclearized North Korea. Lastly, this bill recognizes the terrible human rights abuses inflicted on the people of North Korea. For many years, State Department human rights reports, as well as private organizations' reports, have depicted a pattern of extreme human rights abuses by the tyrannical North Korean regime, including the denial of basic human freedoms: withheld access to food and deplorable prison camps where extrajudicial killings, enslavement, torture, and sexual abuse are widespread. I would like to thank our Chairman Royce and our Ranking Member Engel for their steadfast, bipartisan dedication and leadership to taking action on this global and domestic security issue. This bill provides a critical step forward. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and author of multiple North Korea human rights and sanctions laws. She is also a cosponsor of this bill. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud and pleased to be here speaking on behalf of this bill, H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act. I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for introducing this important bill which, once again, is presented in their usual bipartisan manner. While initial reports, Mr. Speaker, cast doubt on North Korea's claims that it carried out a hydrogen bomb test, any enhancement of the regime's nuclear capability should be--must be--a cause for concern. Both U.S. and South Korean intelligence assessments indicate that North Korea already possesses the capability to install a nuclear warhead on a missile that can reach United States territory or that of our allies. Despite some doubt about that capability's effectiveness, it is just a matter of time before North Korea finishes developing this dangerous technology that it is seeking or, worse, shares this technology with Iran, as these two rogue regimes are bosom buddies and have long been known to collaborate on their ballistic missile programs. What is clear is that our current policy toward North Korea is not working. Administrations from both parties, Mr. Speaker, have made mistakes with North Korea over the years. They have failed to respond to North Korea's violation of its nuclear deal and have failed to hold the regime accountable for its illicit activity. Administration after administration have removed North Korea off the State Sponsors of Terrorism list and continue to keep the regime off that list despite mounting evidence that would support its inclusion back on the terrorism list. Various administrations have utterly failed to enforce the North Korea sanctions that we already have on the books. The Obama administration's so-called strategic patience policy with North Korea has proven to be a disaster, and it is time that we fully and vigorously enforce the existing sanctions and expand upon those to implement new sanctions on Pyongyang until its nuclear program is dismantled. By some estimates, North Korea might already have 10 to 15 nuclear weapons, and Kim Jong-un has shown that he will stop at nothing to get the weapons and the technology that he desires. This bill would help ensure that our sanctions on North Korea are finally being enforced the way they always should have been, but we can't forget that North Korea cannot make progress on its nuclear program alone. North Korea has a long history of collaborating with other rogue regimes, and we must ensure that we are enforcing sanctions on all of its collaborators. Any government entity or individual that has sold or transferred weapons or technology to North Korea in violation of U.S. law or U.N. Security Council resolution should also be targeted for sanctions. Mr. Speaker, I will end with this note: North Korea has been writing the playbook for rogue regimes to follow, and unless this administration gets serious about confronting Pyongyang's aggressions, I worry that it will continue to allow Iran to take advantage of us, that we won't enforce sanctions on Tehran, just like we are not enforcing them on North Korea. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. In a few years' time, we will be back here debating what to do after another nuclear device test by North Korea, by Iran, or by other rogue actors. North Korea poses an imminent threat now to our security as well as that of our allies. We cannot afford to ignore it nor look the other way. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this important bill and urge its passage. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for this bill. {time} 1630 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Colleagues, a nuclear weapon in the hands of North Korea, a rogue, destabilizing country on the peninsula and across the region, is simply a nonstarter. It is unthinkable. Despite our tough sanctions and increasing isolation from the global community, Pyongyang continues down a dangerous and destabilizing course. Last week's nuclear test in North Korea is a jarring reminder of just how dangerous the Kim regime is and demands a response from the United States and our allies as well. We must work with South Korea and Japan to make sure this issue is at the top of our agenda in our engagement with China. We must act unilaterally to make sure to North Koreans that their leadership's actions have consequences. H.R. 757 would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. The bill [[Page H240]] would crack down on North Korean elite who do business through shell companies to evade detection and go after anyone helping to prop up the Kim regime through illegal activities. This bill would include important exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the North Korean people. North Koreans deserve much more than what its leaders are providing, which is why we need to pass this legislation. We cannot allow North Korea to continue to be dangerous and frivolous. We have to stand up and say no. They have to understand that we mean business. They have to understand that what they have done is unacceptable and will not stand. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We have the opportunity today to show Americans and the world that Congress is willing to lead on this vital national security issue. This is an issue that Congress has been focused on, obviously, for some time. I have spent much of my time on the Foreign Affairs Committee focused on the North Korean threat. Ranking Member Eliot Engel and I, in one of our first trips together as chairman and ranking member of the committee, traveled to visit our South Korean ally and toured the wreckage of the Cheonan. This was a corvette ship that was hit and split right in half by a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine, costing the lives of 46 sailors. It is a reminder of the attitude that North Korea has in terms of its provocative action. Both Eliot Engel and I have been to North Korea on separate trips, and we can tell you it is a totalitarian state with an ever-present cult of personalities. If you have ever read Orwell's book, ``Nineteen Eighty-Four,'' the society in that book seemed almost more rational than this police state. I was talking to the former Minister of Propaganda. In the no-go areas, 1.9 million were starved to death in North Korea. You ask why. Well, with the paranoia of the police state, they are not considered particularly loyal out there. Besides, the food can be sold on the food exchange in the capital for hard currency. Donated food often is used in this way to support what he calls ``juche,'' to support this philosophy which leads them forward with this desire to have a nuclear weapon and the capability to deliver it. This bipartisan bill, which I authored with Eliot Engel as our principal coauthor, is based on legislation that unanimously passed the House last Congress. Its implementation will help sever a key subsidy for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program, for only when the North Korean leadership realizes that its criminal activities are untenable do prospects for peace and security in Northeast Asia improve. This bill will return us to the one strategy that has worked to pressure North Korea at a time when Kim Jong-un is trying to blackmail his way to consolidating power. Congress must send the message to the Kim regime that they can either reform and disarm or the system can implode. Without hard currency, without being able to pay the generals, that system would implode. By cutting off Kim Jong-un's access to the hard currency he needs for his army and his weapons, this bill, H.R. 757, will squarely present the North Korean regime with that choice. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, recent news of North Korea's claim that it successfully conducted an H-bomb test for the first time, in defiance of United Nations' resolutions ups the ante on why we must remain steadfast in expediently addressing insecurity in our nation and across the globe, as anticipated in this bill by Representative Royce of California, entitled the North Korean Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2,315 which has enjoyed bi-partisan support. Our world today is faced with resurgent and evolving threats from weapons of mass destruction to destructive nuclear ambitions. Indeed, news events inform us of the far-ranging spectrum we must contend with, ranging from persistent nation state-based dangerous nuclear ambitions in North Korea, to continued chemical weapons used in Syria, to terrorist organizations such as Daesh ramping up their destructive capabilities through vitriolic recruitment strategies, that pose an existential threat beyond the borders from which ISIS is operating. I am confident that these are issues that President Obama will be addressing and proposing durable solutions to during his last state of the Union Address as our nation's Commander In Chief. Under his leadership, our nation has achieved foreign policy feats that have worked to maintain our security, promote our geopolitical objectives and advance our diplomatic relationships with key allies. Let's just take a quick look back at some of the President's foreign policy achievements: The capture and neutralization of Osama Bin Laden which brought an end to a nearly decade long manhunt. The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq which helped to bring an end to a costly war, helping our country save billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer funds. The current Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has been instrumental in deterring and stemming Iran's nuclear ambitions and enabling security in the global society. The repealing of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, an aspersion on the personal private matters of those who have dedicated their lives to protect our nation. Signing into law the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), an important treaty that showcases how the U.S. leads by example by signing a treaty that requires both the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear warhead arsenals to 1,550 each, a 30 percent reduction from the 2002 Treaty of Moscow and a 74 percent reduction from the 1991 START treaty. Neutralization of al Qaeda propagandist and foreign fighter recruiter Anwar Al Awlaki, one of the main leaders in the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Indeed, under President Obama's leadership, our country's military aid to Israel has increased remarkably with the eye towards deepening and expanding U.S./Israeli relations-an important aspect of our nation's foreign policy and geopolitical efforts to promote peace in the region. This president's foreign policy achievements in promoting the security of our nation are irrefutable and this is why I support the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2015 because it will empower him to continue his impressive work in this arena. Much like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) championed by this Administration, this bill encourages our President to investigate any credible information of sanctionable activities involving North Korea. Furthermore, this bill will designate and implement sanctions against persons and entities who knowingly engage in or contribute to activities in North Korea whether it is through their exporting or importing of weapons of mass destruction, significant arms, significant luxury goods, money laundering, censorship, or engage in human rights abuses. Pursuant to the bill, the President is empowered to exercise authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as it relates to persons, entities and the government of North Korea. This bill empowers our President with discretionary authority to designate and apply sanctions to persons involved in certain other kinds of conduct. This bill will facilitate civil forfeiture of assets, real or personal, if said properties inure from any attempted or actual violation of this Act, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to such a violation. Other core provisions of the bill is the empowerment of our Treasury Secretary to: determine whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern; and In the event our Treasury Secretary makes this determination, he is empowered to impose one or more special measures with respect to the jurisdiction of North Korea. Finally, our sense of Congress in this bill is in comity with and ensures the consistent enforcement of United Nations Security Council resolutions and financial restrictions on North Korea. Through this bill, our president will be empowered to withhold assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to any country that provides lethal military equipment to, or receives it from the government of North Korea. This bill is also important because it will put into place an enhanced screening procedure whereby our Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) will be able to determine if physical inspections are warranted of any cargo bound for or landed in the United States that has been transported through a foreign seaport or airport whose inspections are deficient if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such cargo contains goods prohibited under this Act. [[Page H241]] This will facilitate expedient seizure of vessels or aircraft used to facilitate sanctionable activities. The President will also be supported in his efforts to produce progress reports on significant activities undermining cyber security conflicted, or otherwise ordered or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the government of North Korea. Our Secretary of State will be supported in his human rights efforts of reporting on each political prison camp in North Korea, which will include a detailed description of those abuses or censorship. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for championing this bill and look forward to working with him and other members of this House in promoting our national security and supporting our President's objective of establishing us as a credible and trusted leader in the global landscape. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 757, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H229-H241] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1600 NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. ROYCE.

Congress finds the following: (1) The Government of North Korea has repeatedly violated its commitments to the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear weapons programs, and has willfully violated multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for it to cease its development, testing, and production of weapons of mass destruction. (2) North Korea poses a grave risk for the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. (3) The Government of North Korea has been implicated repeatedly in money laundering and illicit activities, including prohibited arms sales, narcotics trafficking, the counterfeiting of United States currency, and the counterfeiting of intellectual property of United States persons. (4) The Government of North Korea has, both historically and recently, repeatedly sponsored acts of international terrorism, including attempts to assassinate defectors and human rights activists, repeated threats of violence against foreign persons, leaders, newspapers, and cities, and the shipment of weapons to terrorists and state sponsors of terrorism. (5) North Korea has unilaterally withdrawn from the 1953 Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War, and committed provocations against South Korea in 2010 by sinking the warship Cheonan and killing 46 of her crew, and by shelling Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans. (6) North Korea maintains a system of brutal political prison camps that contain as many as 120,000 men, women, and children, who live in atrocious living conditions with insufficient food, clothing, and medical care, and under constant fear of torture or arbitrary execution. (7) The Congress reaffirms the purposes of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 contained in section 4 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 7802). (8) North Korea has prioritized weapons programs and the procurement of luxury goods, in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and in gross disregard of the needs of its people. (9) The President has determined that the Government of North Korea is responsible for knowingly engaging in significant activities undermining cyber security with respect to United States persons and interests, and for threats of violence against the civilian population of the United States. (10) Persons, including financial institutions, who engage in transactions with, or provide financial services to, the Government of North Korea and its financial institutions without establishing sufficient financial safeguards against North Korea's use of these transactions to promote proliferation, weapons trafficking, human rights violations, illicit activity, and the purchase of luxury goods, aid and abet North Korea's misuse of the international financial system, and also violate the intent of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. [[Page H230]] (11) The Government of North Korea's conduct poses an imminent threat to the security of the United States and its allies, to the global economy, to the safety of members of the United States Armed Forces, to the integrity of the global financial system, to the integrity of global nonproliferation programs, and to the people of North Korea. (12) The Congress seeks, through this legislation, to use nonmilitary means to address this crisis, to provide diplomatic leverage to negotiate necessary changes in North Korea's conduct, and to ease the suffering of the people of North Korea.

TITLE II--SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREAN PROLIFERATION, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, ILLICIT ACTIVITIES, AND SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES UNDERMINING CYBER SECURITY SEC. 201. DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA AS A JURISDICTION OF PRIMARY MONEY LAUNDERING CONCERN. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Undersecretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who is responsible for safeguarding the financial system against illicit use, money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, has repeatedly expressed concern about North Korea's misuse of the international financial system as follows: (A) In 2006, the Undersecretary stated that, given North Korea's ``counterfeiting of U.S. currency, narcotics trafficking and use of accounts worldwide to conduct proliferation-related transactions, the line between illicit and licit North Korean money is nearly invisible'' and urged financial institutions worldwide to ``think carefully about the risks of doing any North Korea-related business.''. [[Page H232]] (B) In 2011, the Undersecretary stated that ``North Korea remains intent on engaging in proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing in material,'' and was ``aggressively pursuing the effort to establish front companies.''. (C) In 2013, the Undersecretary stated, in reference to North Korea's distribution of high-quality counterfeit United States currency, that ``North Korea is continuing to try to pass a supernote into the international financial system,'' and that the Department of the Treasury would soon introduce new currency with improved security features to protect against counterfeiting by the Government of North Korea. (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, has repeatedly-- (A) expressed concern at deficiencies in North Korea's regimes to combat money laundering and terrorist financing; (B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of action to address significant deficiencies in these regimes and the serious threat they pose to the integrity of the international financial system; (C) urged all jurisdictions to apply countermeasures to protect the international financial system from ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing risks emanating from North Korea; (D) urged all jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with North Korea, including North Korean companies and financial institutions; and (E) called on all jurisdictions to protect against correspondent relationships being used to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk mitigation practices, and take into account money laundering and terrorist financing risks when considering requests by North Korean financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in their jurisdiction. (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which-- (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's recommendation on financial sanctions related to proliferation, and its guidance on the implementation of sanctions; (B) decided that Member States should apply enhanced monitoring and other legal measures to prevent the provision of financial services or the transfer of property that could contribute to activities prohibited by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; and (C) called on Member States to prohibit North Korean banks from establishing or maintaining correspondent relationships with banks in their jurisdictions, to prevent the provision of financial services, if they have information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that these activities could contribute to activities prohibited by an applicable United Nations Security Council resolution, or to the evasion of such prohibitions. (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North Korea as a Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering Concern.--Congress-- (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to impose limitations on, and require enhanced monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities; (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms, to immediately designate North Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, and to adopt stringent special measures to safeguard the financial system against the risks posed by North Korea's willful evasion of sanctions and its illicit activities; and (3) urges the President to seek the prompt implementation by other states of enhanced monitoring and due diligence to prevent North Korea's misuse of the international financial system, including by sharing information about activities, transactions, and property that could contribute to activities sanctioned by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions, or to the evasion of sanctions. (c) Determinations Regarding North Korea.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, determine, in consultation with the Secretary of State and Attorney General, and in accordance with section 5318A of title 31, United States Code, whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern. (2) Special measures.--If the Secretary of the Treasury determines under this subsection that reasonable grounds exist for finding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal functional regulators, shall impose one or more of the special measures described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 5318A(b) of title 31, United States Code, with respect to the jurisdiction of North Korea. (3) Report required.-- (A) In general.--If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary makes such determination, submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the determination made under paragraph (1) together with the reasons for that determination. (B) Form.--A report or copy of any report submitted under this paragraph shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex. SEC. 202.

(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President should intensify diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate international fora such as the United Nations and bilaterally, to develop and implement a coordinated, consistent, multilateral strategy for protecting the global financial system against risks emanating from North Korea, including-- (1) the cessation of any financial services whose continuation is inconsistent with applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; (2) the cessation of any financial services to persons, including financial institutions, that present unacceptable risks of facilitating money laundering and illicit activity by the Government of North Korea; (3) the blocking by all states and jurisdictions, in accordance with the legal process of the state or jurisdiction in which the property is held, of any property required to be blocked under applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; (4) the blocking of any property derived from illicit activity, from significant activities undermining cyber security, from the misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement of public funds by, or for the benefit of, officials of the Government of North Korea; (5) the blocking of any property involved in significant activities undermining cyber security by the Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly, against United States persons, or the theft of intellectual property by the Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly from United States persons; and (6) the blocking of any property of persons directly or indirectly involved in censorship or human rights abuses by the Government of North Korea.

General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Leader McCarthy working with myself, working with Ranking Member Eliot Engel of New York to schedule this legislation for floor consideration. Last week, North Korea conducted its fourth known nuclear test. The Kim regime has developed increasingly destructive weapons. What we are concerned about here is the miniaturization of nuclear warheads that fit onto its most reliable missiles. We are also concerned about the submarine tests for firing from a sub these missiles that would be capable of launching those devices. We are concerned about the ongoing efforts to make certain that they have got the range now on a three-stage rocket, ICBM, to hit the United States. This threat is unacceptable, and it has to be aggressively challenged. The legislation that we are considering here is the most comprehensive North Korea sanctions legislation to come before this body. Importantly, what this bill does is use targeted financial and economic pressure to isolate Kim Jong-un and his top officials from the assets that they maintain in foreign banks and from the hard currency that sustains their rule. These assets are derived primarily from illicit activities, such as counterfeiting U.S. currency, something that North Korea has been caught doing with hundred-dollar bank notes, such as selling their missile systems around the world, contraband in cigarettes, drugs, and other illicit activities. And all of that is used to advance North Korea's nuclear program. They also pay for the luxurious lifestyle of the ruling elites, as we have seen in some of the exposes that come out of North Korea, and it is used to repress the people. In other words, the money from that hard currency pays for the generals, pays for the secret police, pays for the missile program and the nuclear weapons program. A strategy of financial pressure is the approach we took a decade ago when the previous administration targeted Banco Delta Asia. That was a Macao-based bank. This was in 2005. They were targeted for their role in laundering money for North Korea, and this cut it off from the financial system, really. This led other banks in the region to shun North Korean business, because when the option is out there between whether or not you are going to bank with North Korea or bank with the U.S. and the rest of the world, it is a fairly easy choice for these banks to make. At that point, they freeze the accounts, and that, obviously, isolates the regime. At that time, according to one former top U.S. official who was speaking to the issue of what the North Koreans would say when they would come into the meetings with the State Department, at every conversation we had with the North Koreans, he said, every one of them began and ended with the same question: ``When do we get our money back?'' Now, the part that got my interest at the time was not only the report that, because he couldn't pay his generals, there were problems for the regime--it is not a good position for a dictator to be in--but also that missile production [[Page H236]] lines had come to a halt because they couldn't buy on the black market; they didn't have the hard currency anymore to do it, the parts that they needed for their programs. Unfortunately, the pressure at the time was lifted. I think it was lifted prematurely for certain because the representation was made that Kim Jong Il was going to make concessions on his nuclear program, concessions that ultimately were never made. From my standpoint, what a mistake. From the standpoint of the people I talk to over at Treasury, what a mistake. They had a different vision on how those sanctions should be maintained. Today, the Obama administration has let its North Korea policy drift. A year ago, it promised a proportional response to the massive cyber terrorist attack against the United States. But to date, the administration's response has been dangerously weak. A mere 18 low- level arms dealers have been sanctioned. That has been it. Failing to respond to North Korea's belligerence, I think, only emboldens their leader. Disrupting North Korea's illicit activities will place tremendous strain on that country's ruling elite who have so brutalized the people of North Korea. I spoke to the defector who used to run their propaganda machinery about this. He defected through China. And he discussed this issue. He said: Look, that hard currency goes, not to the people; it goes for the military apparatus and the political apparatus of the regime. So we have got to go after those illicit activities like we went after organized crime in the United States: identify the network, interdict shipments, disrupt the flow of money. North Korea, after all, has been called a ``gangster regime.'' You have seen that term in the press. Well, it is pretty apt. This regime is a critical threat, frankly, to our national security. Under this bill's framework, anyone laundering money, counterfeiting goods, smuggling, or trafficking narcotics will be subject to significant sanctions. It is also important to remember the deplorable state of human rights in North Korea. Two years ago, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry released the most comprehensive report on North Korea to date, finding that the Kim regime ``has for decades,'' in their words, ``pursued policies involving crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.'' So this bill requires the State Department to use this report's findings to identify the individuals responsible for these abuses and to press for more ways in which to get information into North Korea so as to move the attitudes of the population inside the country. Mr. Speaker, a return to the strategy of effective financial pressure on North Korea is our best bet to end North Korea's threat to its own people, to our South Korean allies, and ultimately to us. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, February 26, 2015. Hon.

I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this measure. I want to first thank our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, for authoring this very good, bipartisan bill. I am very pleased to be the lead Democratic cosponsor. I think this is an important bill, and it ties in with what we have tried to do for these past years on the Foreign Affairs Committee, being bipartisan and letting politics stop at the water's edge when we are talking about international affairs. Mr. Speaker, last week's nuclear test in North Korea was a stark reminder of just how dangerous the Kim regime is. A nuclear weapon in the hands of a rogue power is a threat to peace and stability around the world. North Korea continues to have a destabilizing influence on the peninsula and across the region, and the potential for nuclear fuel from North Korea to end up on the black market in the hands of violent extremists only compounds the threat. Yet, despite the burden of some of the toughest sanctions imaginable, despite constant pressure from the global community, despite the increasing isolation of North Korea from the rest of the world, leaders in Pyongyang persist on this dangerous and destabilizing course. The latest test demands a response. We need to work with our allies, particularly South Korea and Japan. We need to make sure this issue is at the top of the agenda in our engagement with China. China can have a lot of influence and does have a lot of influence over North Korea. We need to act unilaterally to make clear to the North Koreans that their actions have consequences. This bill would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. Let me say I am very proud, again, in a bipartisan way, this bill passed unanimously out of the Foreign Affairs Committee. North Korea has become more and more savvy at evading sanctions, and that is why this bill broadens our sanctions. The country's elites do business with shell companies and cover up the money trail. This allows hard currency to flow into North Korea. This bill would crack down on this practice and go after anyone helping prop up the Kim regime through these illegal activities. I must say that I have been to North Korea twice, to Pyongyang twice. We watched in the morning when people were going to work. The elites do very well there. It is just the rest of the country that is starving. This bill would include the important exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the North Korean people. We help them with food aid. We are the most generous country with feeding North Korea. It is important to point this out because our quarrel is not with the North Korean people. It is with the despot and his aides that run North Korea. We know that the people of North Korea endure deplorable treatment at the hands of a corrupt regime. I can tell you the country's citizens deserve much, much better. That is why we will keep up the pressure on North Korea's leaders and that is why we need to pass this legislation. I urge a ``yes'' vote. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding. I rise in strong support of H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, there is a compelling need to pass tough and effective legislation to freeze the assets of the Kim Jong-un regime. I want to commend Chairman Royce for his long and hard work on North Korea and his determination to bring this bill to the floor. I again thank Ranking Member Eliot Engel for his good, strong sense of bipartisanship. This is a one-two punch against a cruel dictatorship, and this legislation has to get to the President as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, whether it be North Korea or Iran, when will we learn the hard lesson that totalitarian states do not negotiate in good faith, cannot be trusted to hold up their end of the bargain, and use our goodwill and our foreign capital to keep on proliferating? They will not allow intrusive inspections because they cheat and because it weakens their status at home. They use nuclear weapons negotiations to [[Page H238]] enhance their own diplomatic status and to gain concessions. In the end, nuclear negotiations earn rogue nations like Iran and North Korea foreign capital and other investments from the West. They use that to fund additional missile technology, to fund criminal and terrorist activities, and to continue with clandestine nuclear programs. During the Bush administration, the most effective tools in bringing the North Korea dictatorship to heel were the freezing of its assets in the Banco Delta Asia in Macao and the building of an international coalition to interdict suspect North Korea shipping. These should be our priorities now, especially in the shadow of North Korea's nuclear tests, by imposing mandatory sanctions on the perpetrators of human rights abuses, censorship, arms and human trafficking, money laundering, as well proliferation. Nearly 2 years ago, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry reported that the ongoing crimes against humanity in North Korea have no ``parallel in the contemporary world.'' These crimes include ``extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, and racial, and grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons, and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.'' {time} 1615 Kim Jong-un cares not at all about the welfare of his own people. We should expect that he cares even less about the welfare of the people of Japan, South Korea, or even U.S. citizens who face the threat of North Korean nuclear weapons. The U.N. Commission recommended that the U.N. impose targeted sanctions on the North Korean leaders responsible for its human rights crimes. However, China blocks U.N. action. Without U.N. action, the U.S. must act, using our position as the steward of the global financial system. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on North Korea welcomes such action, supporting targeted sanctions of those most responsible for these heinous crimes against humanity. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my friend and colleague and a valued member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from New York, the distinguished ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. I rise today in support of the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their leadership in bringing this legislation before us. I especially appreciate the inclusion of two of my amendments, one to provide for the reunification of Korean families separated by the 38th parallel, and another to ensure that U.S. policy toward North Korea is informed by the recommendations made in the landmark Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea conducted by the United Nations. Amidst the tense geopolitical standoffs and irresponsible actions of the North Korean regime, we must always remember the human cost of this enduring conflict. I believe this bill, through these amendments and important exceptions to sanctions for humanitarian relief organizations, does just that. This is timely, if not overdue, legislation. North Korea is a reckless, paranoid state devoid of virtually all aspects of human autonomy, now armed with a nuclear umbrella. That makes the Korean peninsula one of the most dangerous flash points on the globe. There have been recent developments in North Korea that are profoundly troubling and deserve an immediate response from this Congress. Reports that North Korea has conducted its fourth nuclear weapons test confirm that the regime in Pyongyang is committed to defying international norms and risks destabilizing the entire Asia- Pacific region. As co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, I remain deeply concerned with the volatility and the ever-present potential of conflict on the Korean Peninsula. It is a specter that looms over 75 million Koreans and, for their sake and that of the region, the U.S., the Republic of Korea, China, and other regional stakeholders must demonstrate commitment to addressing this threat. By targeting the individuals and entities that support the Kim regime through illicit activities, this bill will hopefully weaken the resolve and capability of Pyongyang to endanger regional stability. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is also an original cosponsor with me on this legislation. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this piece of legislation up to the House floor. Mr. Speaker, North Korea is a world threat, a nuclear world threat. Its leaders are outlaws with no redeeming social character in their souls, and we need to operate with them knowing this. Last week, North Korea tested another nuclear weapon. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, I held a hearing in October and predicted that this test would happen again. With Iran about to receive hundreds of billions of dollars for its illegal nuclear program, we shouldn't be surprised that North Korea wants a piece of the pie, too. Illegal nuclear programs and material can bring a lot of money to a regime. In the hearing that we had in October, we learned of deep connections between Iran and North Korea. Both nations, among other things, sponsor worldwide terror. They have a history of working together on missile development. There is mounting evidence that they have worked together on their nuclear weapons programs as well. We should expect Iran to keep working with North Korea to advance its own nuclear weapons program. We have sanctions on North Korea, but all those sanctions have not been fully implemented. The administration's policy of strategic patience is not working because this barbaric regime continues to develop nuclear weapons and ICBMs. I say our patience has run out in dealing with them. This bill is Congress showing North Korea that there are consequences for their testing of nuclear weapons. We cannot let North Korea develop its nuclear program even more. North Korea already has submarines with missiles on them that can reach the United States, over 10 nuclear bombs, and for some reason has Austin on its hit list. I take that personally, Mr. Speaker, that Austin is their number one target in the United States. North Korea is a state that imprisons Christians for their faith, starves its citizens, controls the Internet and the media, tortures anyone in its domain who dares to disagree with the regime, and is engaged in cyberterrorism. Dangerous actions by a ruthless dictator must be met by forceful responses. I am glad to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I urge its passage. It is time for them to pay the price for going rogue. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard), our colleague on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a rising star in our committee. Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I am rising today in strong support of H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act, which I am proud to be a cosponsor of. North Korea continues to pose a serious and dangerous threat to my constituents in Hawaii, the Pacific, and the West Coast of the United States. Our communities and our families lie within range of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles. North Korea's nuclear tests just a week ago and their continued pursuit of developing more nuclear weapons and miniaturizing those weapons serve as a reminder of the threat that North Korea poses to our country, which my constituents in Hawaii know all too well. There are some necessary steps that the United States must take to deal with this threat: We need to increase the strength and capabilities of our Pacific fleet and forces. We need to stop [[Page H239]] the downward trend in investment of ballistic missile defense development and capabilities, and strengthen our ballistic missile defense capabilities, specifically in Hawaii and the Pacific, to counter this threat. We need to completely reexamine our strategy of so-called strategic patience with North Korea, recognizing that North Korea has continued to grow in their nuclear and missile capabilities, telling us that the status quo is not working. This bill, however, deals with another important area where we need to act, and that is sanctions. It gives us the tools to respond to North Korea's provocations. One provision would apply sanctions that prohibit the export of munitions to North Korea and severely restrict export licenses for controlled goods and technologies. It would prohibit financial transactions between U.S. persons and the Government of North Korea and sanction those who send or receive lethal military equipment to or from North Korea. The bill will also give us the tools to reapply some of the most effective sanctions that we have ever had against hard currency for those who do business with North Korea. We saw how these sanctions were effective before. Following U.S. action against the Banco Delta Asia based in Macao in 2005, the assets of North Korean banks and leaders were frozen and completely blocked from the international financial system. This directly affected the money being used to develop these nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, and the money also supported the regime's leadership and its elites and their lifestyle. This severely increased the pressure in North Korea, causing them to engage with the international community, coming to an agreement to lift the sanctions in 2007--prematurely, in my view--made in exchange for shutting down and sealing the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and discussing a list of its nuclear-related activities with the U.S. and other parties in the region. The agreement was violated by North Korea in 2009 when they tested a missile, and the sanctions on Banco Delta showed us earlier a way to impact North Korean leadership and business directly. Those sanctions should have been immediately reinstated upon North Korea breaking that agreement, but that is why we are here today--to act. While sanctions alone are not enough, this bill could provide some very important tools to countering North Korea's aggression and ultimately achieving our objective of a denuclearized North Korea. Lastly, this bill recognizes the terrible human rights abuses inflicted on the people of North Korea. For many years, State Department human rights reports, as well as private organizations' reports, have depicted a pattern of extreme human rights abuses by the tyrannical North Korean regime, including the denial of basic human freedoms: withheld access to food and deplorable prison camps where extrajudicial killings, enslavement, torture, and sexual abuse are widespread. I would like to thank our Chairman Royce and our Ranking Member Engel for their steadfast, bipartisan dedication and leadership to taking action on this global and domestic security issue. This bill provides a critical step forward. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and author of multiple North Korea human rights and sanctions laws. She is also a cosponsor of this bill. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud and pleased to be here speaking on behalf of this bill, H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act. I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for introducing this important bill which, once again, is presented in their usual bipartisan manner. While initial reports, Mr. Speaker, cast doubt on North Korea's claims that it carried out a hydrogen bomb test, any enhancement of the regime's nuclear capability should be--must be--a cause for concern. Both U.S. and South Korean intelligence assessments indicate that North Korea already possesses the capability to install a nuclear warhead on a missile that can reach United States territory or that of our allies. Despite some doubt about that capability's effectiveness, it is just a matter of time before North Korea finishes developing this dangerous technology that it is seeking or, worse, shares this technology with Iran, as these two rogue regimes are bosom buddies and have long been known to collaborate on their ballistic missile programs. What is clear is that our current policy toward North Korea is not working. Administrations from both parties, Mr. Speaker, have made mistakes with North Korea over the years. They have failed to respond to North Korea's violation of its nuclear deal and have failed to hold the regime accountable for its illicit activity. Administration after administration have removed North Korea off the State Sponsors of Terrorism list and continue to keep the regime off that list despite mounting evidence that would support its inclusion back on the terrorism list. Various administrations have utterly failed to enforce the North Korea sanctions that we already have on the books. The Obama administration's so-called strategic patience policy with North Korea has proven to be a disaster, and it is time that we fully and vigorously enforce the existing sanctions and expand upon those to implement new sanctions on Pyongyang until its nuclear program is dismantled. By some estimates, North Korea might already have 10 to 15 nuclear weapons, and Kim Jong-un has shown that he will stop at nothing to get the weapons and the technology that he desires. This bill would help ensure that our sanctions on North Korea are finally being enforced the way they always should have been, but we can't forget that North Korea cannot make progress on its nuclear program alone. North Korea has a long history of collaborating with other rogue regimes, and we must ensure that we are enforcing sanctions on all of its collaborators. Any government entity or individual that has sold or transferred weapons or technology to North Korea in violation of U.S. law or U.N. Security Council resolution should also be targeted for sanctions. Mr. Speaker, I will end with this note: North Korea has been writing the playbook for rogue regimes to follow, and unless this administration gets serious about confronting Pyongyang's aggressions, I worry that it will continue to allow Iran to take advantage of us, that we won't enforce sanctions on Tehran, just like we are not enforcing them on North Korea. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. In a few years' time, we will be back here debating what to do after another nuclear device test by North Korea, by Iran, or by other rogue actors. North Korea poses an imminent threat now to our security as well as that of our allies. We cannot afford to ignore it nor look the other way. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this important bill and urge its passage. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for this bill. {time} 1630 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Colleagues, a nuclear weapon in the hands of North Korea, a rogue, destabilizing country on the peninsula and across the region, is simply a nonstarter. It is unthinkable. Despite our tough sanctions and increasing isolation from the global community, Pyongyang continues down a dangerous and destabilizing course. Last week's nuclear test in North Korea is a jarring reminder of just how dangerous the Kim regime is and demands a response from the United States and our allies as well. We must work with South Korea and Japan to make sure this issue is at the top of our agenda in our engagement with China. We must act unilaterally to make sure to North Koreans that their leadership's actions have consequences. H.R. 757 would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. The bill [[Page H240]] would crack down on North Korean elite who do business through shell companies to evade detection and go after anyone helping to prop up the Kim regime through illegal activities. This bill would include important exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the North Korean people. North Koreans deserve much more than what its leaders are providing, which is why we need to pass this legislation. We cannot allow North Korea to continue to be dangerous and frivolous. We have to stand up and say no. They have to understand that we mean business. They have to understand that what they have done is unacceptable and will not stand. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We have the opportunity today to show Americans and the world that Congress is willing to lead on this vital national security issue. This is an issue that Congress has been focused on, obviously, for some time. I have spent much of my time on the Foreign Affairs Committee focused on the North Korean threat. Ranking Member Eliot Engel and I, in one of our first trips together as chairman and ranking member of the committee, traveled to visit our South Korean ally and toured the wreckage of the Cheonan. This was a corvette ship that was hit and split right in half by a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine, costing the lives of 46 sailors. It is a reminder of the attitude that North Korea has in terms of its provocative action. Both Eliot Engel and I have been to North Korea on separate trips, and we can tell you it is a totalitarian state with an ever-present cult of personalities. If you have ever read Orwell's book, ``Nineteen Eighty-Four,'' the society in that book seemed almost more rational than this police state. I was talking to the former Minister of Propaganda. In the no-go areas, 1.9 million were starved to death in North Korea. You ask why. Well, with the paranoia of the police state, they are not considered particularly loyal out there. Besides, the food can be sold on the food exchange in the capital for hard currency. Donated food often is used in this way to support what he calls ``juche,'' to support this philosophy which leads them forward with this desire to have a nuclear weapon and the capability to deliver it. This bipartisan bill, which I authored with Eliot Engel as our principal coauthor, is based on legislation that unanimously passed the House last Congress. Its implementation will help sever a key subsidy for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program, for only when the North Korean leadership realizes that its criminal activities are untenable do prospects for peace and security in Northeast Asia improve. This bill will return us to the one strategy that has worked to pressure North Korea at a time when Kim Jong-un is trying to blackmail his way to consolidating power. Congress must send the message to the Kim regime that they can either reform and disarm or the system can implode. Without hard currency, without being able to pay the generals, that system would implode. By cutting off Kim Jong-un's access to the hard currency he needs for his army and his weapons, this bill, H.R. 757, will squarely present the North Korean regime with that choice. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, recent news of North Korea's claim that it successfully conducted an H-bomb test for the first time, in defiance of United Nations' resolutions ups the ante on why we must remain steadfast in expediently addressing insecurity in our nation and across the globe, as anticipated in this bill by Representative Royce of California, entitled the North Korean Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2,315 which has enjoyed bi-partisan support. Our world today is faced with resurgent and evolving threats from weapons of mass destruction to destructive nuclear ambitions. Indeed, news events inform us of the far-ranging spectrum we must contend with, ranging from persistent nation state-based dangerous nuclear ambitions in North Korea, to continued chemical weapons used in Syria, to terrorist organizations such as Daesh ramping up their destructive capabilities through vitriolic recruitment strategies, that pose an existential threat beyond the borders from which ISIS is operating. I am confident that these are issues that President Obama will be addressing and proposing durable solutions to during his last state of the Union Address as our nation's Commander In Chief. Under his leadership, our nation has achieved foreign policy feats that have worked to maintain our security, promote our geopolitical objectives and advance our diplomatic relationships with key allies. Let's just take a quick look back at some of the President's foreign policy achievements: The capture and neutralization of Osama Bin Laden which brought an end to a nearly decade long manhunt. The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq which helped to bring an end to a costly war, helping our country save billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer funds. The current Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has been instrumental in deterring and stemming Iran's nuclear ambitions and enabling security in the global society. The repealing of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, an aspersion on the personal private matters of those who have dedicated their lives to protect our nation. Signing into law the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), an important treaty that showcases how the U.S. leads by example by signing a treaty that requires both the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear warhead arsenals to 1,550 each, a 30 percent reduction from the 2002 Treaty of Moscow and a 74 percent reduction from the 1991 START treaty. Neutralization of al Qaeda propagandist and foreign fighter recruiter Anwar Al Awlaki, one of the main leaders in the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Indeed, under President Obama's leadership, our country's military aid to Israel has increased remarkably with the eye towards deepening and expanding U.S./Israeli relations-an important aspect of our nation's foreign policy and geopolitical efforts to promote peace in the region. This president's foreign policy achievements in promoting the security of our nation are irrefutable and this is why I support the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2015 because it will empower him to continue his impressive work in this arena. Much like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) championed by this Administration, this bill encourages our President to investigate any credible information of sanctionable activities involving North Korea. Furthermore, this bill will designate and implement sanctions against persons and entities who knowingly engage in or contribute to activities in North Korea whether it is through their exporting or importing of weapons of mass destruction, significant arms, significant luxury goods, money laundering, censorship, or engage in human rights abuses. Pursuant to the bill, the President is empowered to exercise authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as it relates to persons, entities and the government of North Korea. This bill empowers our President with discretionary authority to designate and apply sanctions to persons involved in certain other kinds of conduct. This bill will facilitate civil forfeiture of assets, real or personal, if said properties inure from any attempted or actual violation of this Act, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to such a violation. Other core provisions of the bill is the empowerment of our Treasury Secretary to: determine whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern; and In the event our Treasury Secretary makes this determination, he is empowered to impose one or more special measures with respect to the jurisdiction of North Korea. Finally, our sense of Congress in this bill is in comity with and ensures the consistent enforcement of United Nations Security Council resolutions and financial restrictions on North Korea. Through this bill, our president will be empowered to withhold assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to any country that provides lethal military equipment to, or receives it from the government of North Korea. This bill is also important because it will put into place an enhanced screening procedure whereby our Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) will be able to determine if physical inspections are warranted of any cargo bound for or landed in the United States that has been transported through a foreign seaport or airport whose inspections are deficient if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such cargo contains goods prohibited under this Act. [[Page H241]] This will facilitate expedient seizure of vessels or aircraft used to facilitate sanctionable activities. The President will also be supported in his efforts to produce progress reports on significant activities undermining cyber security conflicted, or otherwise ordered or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the government of North Korea. Our Secretary of State will be supported in his human rights efforts of reporting on each political prison camp in North Korea, which will include a detailed description of those abuses or censorship. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for championing this bill and look forward to working with him and other members of this House in promoting our national security and supporting our President's objective of establishing us as a credible and trusted leader in the global landscape. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 757, as amended.

[[page h232]] (b) in 2011, the undersecretary stated that ``north korea remains intent on engaging in proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing in material,'' and was ``aggressively pursuing the effort to establish front companies.''. (c) in 2013, the undersecretary stated, in reference to north korea's distribution of high-quality counterfeit united states currency, that ``north korea is continuing to try to pass a supernote into the international financial system,'' and that the department of the treasury would soon introduce new currency with improved security features to protect against counterfeiting by the government of north korea. (2) the financial action task force, an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, has repeatedly-- (a) expressed concern at deficiencies in north korea's regimes to combat money laundering and terrorist financing; (b) urged north korea to adopt a plan of action to address significant deficiencies in these regimes and the serious threat they pose to the integrity of the international financial system; (c) urged all jurisdictions to apply countermeasures to protect the international financial system from ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing risks emanating from north korea; (d) urged all jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with north korea, including north korean companies and financial institutions; and (e) called on all jurisdictions to protect against correspondent relationships being used to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk mitigation practices, and take into account money laundering and terrorist financing risks when considering requests by north korean financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in their jurisdiction.

mr. speaker, i appreciate leader mccarthy working with myself, working with ranking member eliot engel of new york to schedule this legislation for floor consideration. last week, north korea conducted its fourth known nuclear test. the kim regime has developed increasingly destructive weapons. what we are concerned about here is the miniaturization of nuclear warheads that fit onto its most reliable missiles. we are also concerned about the submarine tests for firing from a sub these missiles that would be capable of launching those devices. we are concerned about the ongoing efforts to make certain that they have got the range now on a three-stage rocket, icbm, to hit the united states. this threat is unacceptable, and it has to be aggressively challenged. the legislation that we are considering here is the most comprehensive north korea sanctions legislation to come before this body. importantly, what this bill does is use targeted financial and economic pressure to isolate kim jong-un and his top officials from the assets that they maintain in foreign banks and from the hard currency that sustains their rule. these assets are derived primarily from illicit activities, such as counterfeiting u.s. currency, something that north korea has been caught doing with hundred-dollar bank notes, such as selling their missile systems around the world, contraband in cigarettes, drugs, and other illicit activities. and all of that is used to advance north korea's nuclear program. they also pay for the luxurious lifestyle of the ruling elites, as we have seen in some of the exposes that come out of north korea, and it is used to repress the people. in other words, the money from that hard currency pays for the generals, pays for the secret police, pays for the missile program and the nuclear weapons program. a strategy of financial pressure is the approach we took a decade ago when the previous administration targeted banco delta asia. that was a macao-based bank. this was in 2005. they were targeted for their role in laundering money for north korea, and this cut it off from the financial system, really. this led other banks in the region to shun north korean business, because when the option is out there between whether or not you are going to bank with north korea or bank with the u.s. and the rest of the world, it is a fairly easy choice for these banks to make. at that point, they freeze the accounts, and that, obviously, isolates the regime. at that time, according to one former top u.s. official who was speaking to the issue of what the north koreans would say when they would come into the meetings with the state department, at every conversation we had with the north koreans, he said, every one of them began and ended with the same question: ``when do we get our money back?'' now, the part that got my interest at the time was not only the report that, because he couldn't pay his generals, there were problems for the regime--it is not a good position for a dictator to be in--but also that missile production [[page h236]] lines had come to a halt because they couldn't buy on the black market; they didn't have the hard currency anymore to do it, the parts that they needed for their programs. unfortunately, the pressure at the time was lifted. i think it was lifted prematurely for certain because the representation was made that kim jong il was going to make concessions on his nuclear program, concessions that ultimately were never made. from my standpoint, what a mistake. from the standpoint of the people i talk to over at treasury, what a mistake. they had a different vision on how those sanctions should be maintained. today, the obama administration has let its north korea policy drift. a year ago, it promised a proportional response to the massive cyber terrorist attack against the united states. but to date, the administration's response has been dangerously weak. a mere 18 low- level arms dealers have been sanctioned. that has been it. failing to respond to north korea's belligerence, i think, only emboldens their leader. disrupting north korea's illicit activities will place tremendous strain on that country's ruling elite who have so brutalized the people of north korea. i spoke to the defector who used to run their propaganda machinery about this. he defected through china. and he discussed this issue. he said: look, that hard currency goes, not to the people; it goes for the military apparatus and the political apparatus of the regime. so we have got to go after those illicit activities like we went after organized crime in the united states: identify the network, interdict shipments, disrupt the flow of money. north korea, after all, has been called a ``gangster regime.'' you have seen that term in the press. well, it is pretty apt. this regime is a critical threat, frankly, to our national security. under this bill's framework, anyone laundering money, counterfeiting goods, smuggling, or trafficking narcotics will be subject to significant sanctions. it is also important to remember the deplorable state of human rights in north korea. two years ago, a u.n. commission of inquiry released the most comprehensive report on north korea to date, finding that the kim regime ``has for decades,'' in their words, ``pursued policies involving crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.'' so this bill requires the state department to use this report's findings to identify the individuals responsible for these abuses and to press for more ways in which to get information into north korea so as to move the attitudes of the population inside the country. mr. speaker, a return to the strategy of effective financial pressure on north korea is our best bet to end north korea's threat to its own people, to our south korean allies, and ultimately to us. i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on oversight and

measure. i want to first thank our chairman of the foreign affairs committee, ed royce, for authoring this very good, bipartisan bill. i am very pleased to be the lead democratic cosponsor. i think this is an important bill, and it ties in with what we have tried to do for these past years on the foreign affairs committee, being bipartisan and letting politics stop at the water's edge when we are talking about international affairs. mr. speaker, last week's nuclear test in north korea was a stark reminder of just how dangerous the kim regime is. a nuclear weapon in the hands of a rogue power is a threat to peace and stability around the world. north korea continues to have a destabilizing influence on the peninsula and across the region, and the potential for nuclear fuel from north korea to end up on the black market in the hands of violent extremists only compounds the threat. yet, despite the burden of some of the toughest sanctions imaginable, despite constant pressure from the global community, despite the increasing isolation of north korea from the rest of the world, leaders in pyongyang persist on this dangerous and destabilizing course. the latest test demands a response. we need to work with our allies, particularly south korea and japan. we need to make sure this issue is at the top of the agenda in our engagement with china. china can have a lot of influence and does have a lot of influence over north korea. we need to act unilaterally to make clear to the north koreans that their actions have consequences. this bill would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. let me say i am very proud, again, in a bipartisan way, this bill passed unanimously out of the foreign affairs committee. north korea has become more and more savvy at evading sanctions, and that is why this bill broadens our sanctions. the country's elites do business with shell companies and cover up the money trail. this allows hard currency to flow into north korea. this bill would crack down on this practice and go after anyone helping prop up the kim regime through these illegal activities. i must say that i have been to north korea twice, to pyongyang twice. we watched in the morning when people were going to work. the elites do very well there. it is just the rest of the country that is starving. this bill would include the important exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the north korean people. we help them with food aid. we are the most generous country with feeding north korea. it is important to point this out because our quarrel is not with the north korean people. it is with the despot and his aides that run north korea. we know that the people of north korea endure deplorable treatment at the hands of a corrupt regime. i can tell you the country's citizens deserve much, much better. that is why we will keep up the pressure on north korea's leaders and that is why we need to pass this legislation. i urge a ``yes'' vote. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith), chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on africa, global health, global human rights, and international organizations. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i thank the distinguished chairman for yielding. i rise in strong support of h.r. 757, the north korea sanctions enforcement act of 2016. mr. speaker, there is a compelling need to pass tough and effective legislation to freeze the assets of the kim jong-un regime. i want to commend chairman royce for his long and hard work on north korea and his determination to bring this bill to the floor. i again thank ranking member eliot engel for his good, strong sense of bipartisanship. this is a one-two punch against a cruel dictatorship, and this legislation has to get to the president as soon as possible. mr. speaker, whether it be north korea or iran, when will we learn the hard lesson that totalitarian states do not negotiate in good faith, cannot be trusted to hold up their end of the bargain, and use our goodwill and our foreign capital to keep on proliferating? they will not allow intrusive inspections because they cheat and because it weakens their status at home. they use nuclear weapons negotiations to [[page h238]] enhance their own diplomatic status and to gain concessions. in the end, nuclear negotiations earn rogue nations like iran and north korea foreign capital and other investments from the west. they use that to fund additional missile technology, to fund criminal and terrorist activities, and to continue with clandestine nuclear programs. during the bush administration, the most effective tools in bringing the north korea dictatorship to heel were the freezing of its assets in the banco delta asia in macao and the building of an international coalition to interdict suspect north korea shipping. these should be our priorities now, especially in the shadow of north korea's nuclear tests, by imposing mandatory sanctions on the perpetrators of human rights abuses, censorship, arms and human trafficking, money laundering, as well proliferation. nearly 2 years ago, the u.n. commission of inquiry reported that the ongoing crimes against humanity in north korea have no ``parallel in the contemporary world.'' these crimes include ``extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, and racial, and grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons, and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.'' {time} 1615 kim jong-un cares not at all about the welfare of his own people. we should expect that he cares even less about the welfare of the people of japan, south korea, or even u.s. citizens who face the threat of north korean nuclear weapons. the u.n. commission recommended that the u.n. impose targeted sanctions on the north korean leaders responsible for its human rights crimes. however, china blocks u.n. action. without u.n. action, the u.s. must act, using our position as the steward of the global financial system. the u.n. special rapporteur on north korea welcomes such action, supporting targeted sanctions of those most responsible for these heinous crimes against humanity. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. connolly), my friend and colleague and a valued member of the committee on foreign affairs. mr. connolly. mr. speaker, i thank my dear friend from new york, the distinguished ranking member of the house committee on foreign affairs. i rise today in support of the north korea sanctions enforcement act of 2016. i want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their leadership in bringing this legislation before us. i especially appreciate the inclusion of two of my amendments, one to provide for the reunification of korean families separated by the 38th parallel, and another to ensure that u.s. policy toward north korea is informed by the recommendations made in the landmark commission of inquiry on human rights in north korea conducted by the united nations. amidst the tense geopolitical standoffs and irresponsible actions of the north korean regime, we must always remember the human cost of this enduring conflict. i believe this bill, through these amendments and important exceptions to sanctions for humanitarian relief organizations, does just that. this is timely, if not overdue, legislation. north korea is a reckless, paranoid state devoid of virtually all aspects of human autonomy, now armed with a nuclear umbrella. that makes the korean peninsula one of the most dangerous flash points on the globe. there have been recent developments in north korea that are profoundly troubling and deserve an immediate response from this congress. reports that north korea has conducted its fourth nuclear weapons test confirm that the regime in pyongyang is committed to defying international norms and risks destabilizing the entire asia- pacific region. as co-chairman of the congressional caucus on korea, i remain deeply concerned with the volatility and the ever-present potential of conflict on the korean peninsula. it is a specter that looms over 75 million koreans and, for their sake and that of the region, the u.s., the republic of korea, china, and other regional stakeholders must demonstrate commitment to addressing this threat. by targeting the individuals and entities that support the kim regime through illicit activities, this bill will hopefully weaken the resolve and capability of pyongyang to endanger regional stability. mr. speaker, i urge passage of the bill. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. poe), chairman of the subcommittee on terrorism, nonproliferation, and trade of the committee on foreign affairs. he is also an original cosponsor with me on this legislation. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this piece of legislation up to the house floor. mr. speaker, north korea is a world threat, a nuclear world threat. its leaders are outlaws with no redeeming social character in their souls, and we need to operate with them knowing this. last week, north korea tested another nuclear weapon. as chairman of the subcommittee on terrorism, nonproliferation, and trade, i held a hearing in october and predicted that this test would happen again. with iran about to receive hundreds of billions of dollars for its illegal nuclear program, we shouldn't be surprised that north korea wants a piece of the pie, too. illegal nuclear programs and material can bring a lot of money to a regime. in the hearing that we had in october, we learned of deep connections between iran and north korea. both nations, among other things, sponsor worldwide terror. they have a history of working together on missile development. there is mounting evidence that they have worked together on their nuclear weapons programs as well. we should expect iran to keep working with north korea to advance its own nuclear weapons program. we have sanctions on north korea, but all those sanctions have not been fully implemented. the administration's policy of strategic patience is not working because this barbaric regime continues to develop nuclear weapons and icbms. i say our patience has run out in dealing with them. this bill is congress showing north korea that there are consequences for their testing of nuclear weapons. we cannot let north korea develop its nuclear program even more. north korea already has submarines with missiles on them that can reach the united states, over 10 nuclear bombs, and for some reason has austin on its hit list. i take that personally, mr. speaker, that austin is their number one target in the united states. north korea is a state that imprisons christians for their faith, starves its citizens, controls the internet and the media, tortures anyone in its domain who dares to disagree with the regime, and is engaged in cyberterrorism. dangerous actions by a ruthless dictator must be met by forceful responses. i am glad to be an original cosponsor of this bill. i urge its passage. it is time for them to pay the price for going rogue. and that is just the way it is. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from hawaii (ms. gabbard), our colleague on the committee on foreign affairs, a rising star in our committee. ms. gabbard. mr. speaker, i am rising today in strong support of h.r. 757, the north korea sanctions enforcement act, which i am proud to be a cosponsor of. north korea continues to pose a serious and dangerous threat to my constituents in hawaii, the pacific, and the west coast of the united states. our communities and our families lie within range of north korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles. north korea's nuclear tests just a week ago and their continued pursuit of developing more nuclear weapons and miniaturizing those weapons serve as a reminder of the threat that north korea poses to our country, which my constituents in hawaii know all too well. there are some necessary steps that the united states must take to deal with this threat: we need to increase the strength and capabilities of our pacific fleet and forces. we need to stop [[page h239]] the downward trend in investment of ballistic missile defense development and capabilities, and strengthen our ballistic missile defense capabilities, specifically in hawaii and the pacific, to counter this threat. we need to completely reexamine our strategy of so-called strategic patience with north korea, recognizing that north korea has continued to grow in their nuclear and missile capabilities, telling us that the status quo is not working. this bill, however, deals with another important area where we need to act, and that is sanctions. it gives us the tools to respond to north korea's provocations. one provision would apply sanctions that prohibit the export of munitions to north korea and severely restrict export licenses for controlled goods and technologies. it would prohibit financial transactions between u.s. persons and the government of north korea and sanction those who send or receive lethal military equipment to or from north korea. the bill will also give us the tools to reapply some of the most effective sanctions that we have ever had against hard currency for those who do business with north korea. we saw how these sanctions were effective before. following u.s. action against the banco delta asia based in macao in 2005, the assets of north korean banks and leaders were frozen and completely blocked from the international financial system. this directly affected the money being used to develop these nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, and the money also supported the regime's leadership and its elites and their lifestyle. this severely increased the pressure in north korea, causing them to engage with the international community, coming to an agreement to lift the sanctions in 2007--prematurely, in my view--made in exchange for shutting down and sealing the yongbyon nuclear facilities and discussing a list of its nuclear-related activities with the u.s. and other parties in the region. the agreement was violated by north korea in 2009 when they tested a missile, and the sanctions on banco delta showed us earlier a way to impact north korean leadership and business directly. those sanctions should have been immediately reinstated upon north korea breaking that agreement, but that is why we are here today--to act. while sanctions alone are not enough, this bill could provide some very important tools to countering north korea's aggression and ultimately achieving our objective of a denuclearized north korea. lastly, this bill recognizes the terrible human rights abuses inflicted on the people of north korea. for many years, state department human rights reports, as well as private organizations' reports, have depicted a pattern of extreme human rights abuses by the tyrannical north korean regime, including the denial of basic human freedoms: withheld access to food and deplorable prison camps where extrajudicial killings, enslavement, torture, and sexual abuse are widespread. i would like to thank our chairman royce and our ranking member engel for their steadfast, bipartisan dedication and leadership to taking action on this global and domestic security issue. this bill provides a critical step forward. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the committee on foreign affairs and author of multiple north korea human rights and sanctions laws. she is also a cosponsor of this bill. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i am so proud and pleased to be here speaking on behalf of this bill, h.r. 757, the north korea sanctions enforcement act. i thank chairman royce and ranking member engel for introducing this important bill which, once again, is presented in their usual bipartisan manner. while initial reports, mr. speaker, cast doubt on north korea's claims that it carried out a hydrogen bomb test, any enhancement of the regime's nuclear capability should be--must be--a cause for concern. both u.s. and south korean intelligence assessments indicate that north korea already possesses the capability to install a nuclear warhead on a missile that can reach united states territory or that of our allies. despite some doubt about that capability's effectiveness, it is just a matter of time before north korea finishes developing this dangerous technology that it is seeking or, worse, shares this technology with iran, as these two rogue regimes are bosom buddies and have long been known to collaborate on their ballistic missile programs. what is clear is that our current policy toward north korea is not working. administrations from both parties, mr. speaker, have made mistakes with north korea over the years. they have failed to respond to north korea's violation of its nuclear deal and have failed to hold the regime accountable for its illicit activity. administration after administration have removed north korea off the state sponsors of terrorism list and continue to keep the regime off that list despite mounting evidence that would support its inclusion back on the terrorism list. various administrations have utterly failed to enforce the north korea sanctions that we already have on the books. the obama administration's so-called strategic patience policy with north korea has proven to be a disaster, and it is time that we fully and vigorously enforce the existing sanctions and expand upon those to implement new sanctions on pyongyang until its nuclear program is dismantled. by some estimates, north korea might already have 10 to 15 nuclear weapons, and kim jong-un has shown that he will stop at nothing to get the weapons and the technology that he desires. this bill would help ensure that our sanctions on north korea are finally being enforced the way they always should have been, but we can't forget that north korea cannot make progress on its nuclear program alone. north korea has a long history of collaborating with other rogue regimes, and we must ensure that we are enforcing sanctions on all of its collaborators. any government entity or individual that has sold or transferred weapons or technology to north korea in violation of u.s. law or u.n. security council resolution should also be targeted for sanctions. mr. speaker, i will end with this note: north korea has been writing the playbook for rogue regimes to follow, and unless this administration gets serious about confronting pyongyang's aggressions, i worry that it will continue to allow iran to take advantage of us, that we won't enforce sanctions on tehran, just like we are not enforcing them on north korea. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman. ms. ros-lehtinen. in a few years' time, we will be back here debating what to do after another nuclear device test by north korea, by iran, or by other rogue actors. north korea poses an imminent threat now to our security as well as that of our allies. we cannot afford to ignore it nor look the other way. i urge all of my colleagues to vote for this important bill and urge its passage. i thank the chairman and the ranking member for this bill. {time} 1630 mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. colleagues, a nuclear weapon in the hands of north korea, a rogue, destabilizing country on the peninsula and across the region, is simply a nonstarter. it is unthinkable. despite our tough sanctions and increasing isolation from the global community, pyongyang continues down a dangerous and destabilizing course. last week's nuclear test in north korea is a jarring reminder of just how dangerous the kim regime is and demands a response from the united states and our allies as well. we must work with south korea and japan to make sure this issue is at the top of our agenda in our engagement with china. we must act unilaterally to make sure to north koreans that their leadership's actions have consequences. h.r. 757 would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. the bill [[page h240]] would crack down on north korean elite who do business through shell companies to evade detection and go after anyone helping to prop up the kim regime through illegal activities. this bill would include important exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the north korean people. north koreans deserve much more than what its leaders are providing, which is why we need to pass this legislation. we cannot allow north korea to continue to be dangerous and frivolous. we have to stand up and say no. they have to understand that we mean business. they have to understand that what they have done is unacceptable and will not stand. i urge my colleagues to support this measure. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. we have the opportunity today to show americans and the world that congress is willing to lead on this vital national security issue. this is an issue that congress has been focused on, obviously, for some time. i have spent much of my time on the foreign affairs committee focused on the north korean threat. ranking member eliot engel and i, in one of our first trips together as chairman and ranking member of the committee, traveled to visit our south korean ally and toured the wreckage of the cheonan. this was a corvette ship that was hit and split right in half by a torpedo fired by a north korean submarine, costing the lives of 46 sailors. it is a reminder of the attitude that north korea has in terms of its provocative action. both eliot engel and i have been to north korea on separate trips, and we can tell you it is a totalitarian state with an ever-present cult of personalities. if you have ever read orwell's book, ``nineteen eighty-four,'' the society in that book seemed almost more rational than this police state. i was talking to the former minister of propaganda. in the no-go areas, 1.9 million were starved to death in north korea. you ask why. well, with the paranoia of the police state, they are not considered particularly loyal out there. besides, the food can be sold on the food exchange in the capital for hard currency. donated food often is used in this way to support what he calls ``juche,'' to support this philosophy which leads them forward with this desire to have a nuclear weapon and the capability to deliver it. this bipartisan bill, which i authored with eliot engel as our principal coauthor, is based on legislation that unanimously passed the house last congress. its implementation will help sever a key subsidy for north korea's weapons of mass destruction program, for only when the north korean leadership realizes that its criminal activities are untenable do prospects for peace and security in northeast asia improve. this bill will return us to the one strategy that has worked to pressure north korea at a time when kim jong-un is trying to blackmail his way to consolidating power. congress must send the message to the kim regime that they can either reform and disarm or the system can implode. without hard currency, without being able to pay the generals, that system would implode. by cutting off kim jong-un's access to the hard currency he needs for his army and his weapons, this bill, h.r. 757, will squarely present the north korean regime with that choice. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, recent news of north korea's claim that it successfully conducted an h-bomb test for the first time, in defiance of united nations' resolutions ups the ante on why we must remain steadfast in expediently addressing insecurity in our nation and across the globe, as anticipated in this bill by representative royce of california, entitled the north korean sanctions enforcement act of 2,315 which has enjoyed bi-partisan support. our world today is faced with resurgent and evolving threats from weapons of mass destruction to destructive nuclear ambitions. indeed, news events inform us of the far-ranging spectrum we must contend with, ranging from persistent nation state-based dangerous nuclear ambitions in north korea, to continued chemical weapons used in syria, to terrorist organizations such as daesh ramping up their destructive capabilities through vitriolic recruitment strategies, that pose an existential threat beyond the borders from which isis is operating. i am confident that these are issues that president obama will be addressing and proposing durable solutions to during his last state of the union address as our nation's commander in chief. under his leadership, our nation has achieved foreign policy feats that have worked to maintain our security, promote our geopolitical objectives and advance our diplomatic relationships with key allies. let's just take a quick look back at some of the president's foreign policy achievements: the capture and neutralization of osama bin laden which brought an end to a nearly decade long manhunt. the withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq which helped to bring an end to a costly war, helping our country save billions of dollars in u.s. taxpayer funds. the current joint comprehensive plan of action, which has been instrumental in deterring and stemming iran's nuclear ambitions and enabling security in the global society. the repealing of don't ask, don't tell, an aspersion on the personal private matters of those who have dedicated their lives to protect our nation. signing into law the new strategic arms reduction treaty (start), an important treaty that showcases how the u.s. leads by example by signing a treaty that requires both the united states and russia to reduce their nuclear warhead arsenals to 1,550 each, a 30 percent reduction from the 2002 treaty of moscow and a 74 percent reduction from the 1991 start treaty. neutralization of al qaeda propagandist and foreign fighter recruiter anwar al awlaki, one of the main leaders in the al qaeda in the arabian peninsula (aqap). indeed, under president obama's leadership, our country's military aid to israel has increased remarkably with the eye towards deepening and expanding u.s./israeli relations-an important aspect of our nation's foreign policy and geopolitical efforts to promote peace in the region. this president's foreign policy achievements in promoting the security of our nation are irrefutable and this is why i support the north korea sanctions enforcement act of 2015 because it will empower him to continue his impressive work in this arena. much like the joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa) championed by this administration, this bill encourages our president to investigate any credible information of sanctionable activities involving north korea. furthermore, this bill will designate and implement sanctions against persons and entities who knowingly engage in or contribute to activities in north korea whether it is through their exporting or importing of weapons of mass destruction, significant arms, significant luxury goods, money laundering, censorship, or engage in human rights abuses. pursuant to the bill, the president is empowered to exercise authorities under the international emergency economic powers act (ieepa) as it relates to persons, entities and the government of north korea. this bill empowers our president with discretionary authority to designate and apply sanctions to persons involved in certain other kinds of conduct. this bill will facilitate civil forfeiture of assets, real or personal, if said properties inure from any attempted or actual violation of this act, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to such a violation. other core provisions of the bill is the empowerment of our treasury secretary to: determine whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that north korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern; and in the event our treasury secretary makes this determination, he is empowered to impose one or more special measures with respect to the jurisdiction of north korea. finally, our sense of congress in this bill is in comity with and ensures the consistent enforcement of united nations security council resolutions and financial restrictions on north korea. through this bill, our president will be empowered to withhold assistance under the foreign assistance act of 1961 to any country that provides lethal military equipment to, or receives it from the government of north korea. this bill is also important because it will put into place an enhanced screening procedure whereby our secretary of homeland security (dhs) will be able to determine if physical inspections are warranted of any cargo bound for or landed in the united states that has been transported through a foreign seaport or airport whose inspections are deficient if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such cargo contains goods prohibited under this act. [[page h241]] this will facilitate expedient seizure of vessels or aircraft used to facilitate sanctionable activities. the president will also be supported in his efforts to produce progress reports on significant activities undermining cyber security conflicted, or otherwise ordered or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the government of north korea. our secretary of state will be supported in his human rights efforts of reporting on each political prison camp in north korea, which will include a detailed description of those abuses or censorship. again, i thank chairman royce for championing this bill and look forward to working with him and other members of this house in promoting our national security and supporting our president's objective of establishing us as a credible and trusted leader in the global landscape. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from california (mr. royce) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 757, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. royce. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",110235

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each will control 20 minutes. [[Page H253]] The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), the former chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and one of the lead sponsors of this bill. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. It is no accident that this is one of the first bills of the new year. Like some of the other legislation, it is not a new idea. In many ways, what it really is is this body, once again, if you will, reiterating when we talk about freedom of information for the American people, whether it is a private citizen who doesn't know what the government knows about him or her and would like to or it is an interest group, a think tank, or very, very often the press--The New York Times, The Washington Post, the LA Times, and a host more--wanting to know what the government is doing, what their government is doing with their money, their freedoms. This bill emphasizes in no uncertain terms something that is long overdue: that the balance between the American people's right to know about their information and the government's right to keep a secret shall always be balanced in favor and presumed to be the American people's right. In other words, no longer, after this bill is signed into law, will an administration, Republican or Democratic, be able to presume that they are going to say no if they possibly can. Instead, this bill shifts the burden to the presumption of yes. Not only does it shift the burden, but it puts an outright mandate that, after 25 years, information not covered by national security requirements or classifications of secret or above, shall, in fact, simply be available. These are fundamentally important distinctions between the current law. But more to the point of a modernization, this legislation mandates a single point of asking for FOIA, an assumption that it is long overdue for us to streamline and improve the ability to get this information and get it to everyone. One of the aspects of the legislation is that H.R. 653 will require that information asked for again and again and again be posted and available for everyone rather than each time being a burden of somebody wanting similar or even identical information to have to put in a FOIA request. Mr. Speaker, what I want to close with is this isn't just bipartisan; this is universal. Members of the House and the Senate, whether there is a Republican or Democratic President, whether it is on behalf of a constituent wanting some simple information, we regularly use the Freedom of Information Act, and we regularly find ourselves frustrated. This is good for the administration. It builds on legislation like the DATA Act and other reforms that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee have done over a number of years. Lastly, I want to thank my good friend from Maryland (Mr. Cummings). From the very day we began heading the committee, more than 5 years ago now, together, he has always been for FOIA reform, always been for more transparency, and always been supportive of the legislation you see here today. I want to thank Mr. Cummings, something that I don't get enough chances to do. And I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz for bringing this bill, not only as it was originally written, but with some important modifications to make it, hopefully, go through quickly when it is considered by the Senate. I urge its support. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 653, the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act. I want to start by thanking Representative Darrell Issa for working with me on this legislation. We first introduced the FOIA Act in March 2013. The bill before us today is the product of 3 years of work--hard work--feedback, negotiation, and perseverance. I also want to thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, for his work on this bill and his strong support for bringing it to the House floor today. I would say that this is a bipartisan effort, but it is more than that. We actually worked very, very hard together, all of us, to make this happen. If there was any case where we had to use this term of not moving to common ground but moving to higher ground, it would be this legislation. Open government advocates--journalists, editorial boards, and everyday citizens--who support this bill also deserve a tremendous amount of gratitude. The FOIA Act would strengthen the cornerstone of our open government laws and the Freedom of Information Act. This legislation builds on the historic work of the Obama administration, which I believe will go down in history as the most transparent administration to date. The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place in a memo issued on his first day in office. The bill would require agencies to identify specific identifiable harm to an interest protected by exemption unless disclosure is prohibited by law. This provision would not require agencies to disclose classified information, it would not require agencies to disclose anything they are prohibited from disclosing by law, and it would not remove any of FOIA's existing time exemptions. It would, however, put the burden on agencies where it should be: to justify keeping government information secret. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset exemption 5 of FOIA--the deliberative process exemption--and limit the scope of records that agencies could withhold under that exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central portal to allow FOIA requests to any agency through one Web site. The Office of Government Information Services, the FOIA ombudsman created by Congress in 2007, would become more independent, which is very important under this bill, because that office would be allowed to submit testimony and reports directly to Congress without going through political review. This bill is coming to the floor with an amendment that makes a number of changes, and many of them proposed by Chairman Chaffetz. Some of these additions include requiring agencies to provide each FOIA requester with a contact name and information for an agency employee who can provide information on the status of the request. This is so very, very important. Our bill has widespread support. A coalition of 47 open government groups sent a letter in support of this bill on February 5, 2015, that said: ``Congress must act this year to ensure that FOIA stays current with people's need to access government information and resilient in the face of attempts to subvert that access.'' {time} 1730 Numerous editorial boards have written, urging Congress to pass FOIA reform legislation. A New York Times editorial from February 2015 reads: ``This is a rare chance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public interest.'' A USA Today editorial in March 2015 called for the enactment of this bill's reforms. A Los Angeles Times editorial read that this legislation and a similar bill in the Senate ``deserves to be passed.'' This is a movement called Fix FOIA by 50. That movement is aimed at getting H.R. 653 enacted before the 50th anniversary of FOIA in July of this year. An online clearinghouse for the movement includes stories from journalists about why FOIA is critical to their work and why this legislation must be enacted. It is important to note that, even with the enactment of this legislation, the work of Congress must continue. Agency FOIA staff are being asked to do more than ever before. From 2009 to [[Page H254]] 2014, the overall number of FOIA requests submitted to Federal agencies increased by 28 percent with new records set in each of the past 4 years in a row. The total number of FOIA personnel, however, decreased by about 4 percent. Congress must give these agencies more resources. Again, I thank Congressman Issa for all of his hard work. I know that he has been on this bill for a long time and has tried to make sure it gets passed. Again, I want to thank both staffs for working so hard. Since Chairman Chaffetz became chairman, we have had two meetings, and I know our staffs have had numerous meetings and have hammered out the details to make a very good bill a better bill. I want to thank them. I urge my colleagues to vote for transparency and for the American people by voting ``yes'' on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a good, much-needed piece of legislation. It is hard to believe that FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act, was passed nearly 50 years ago. We are a little different in the United States. We are self-critical. We do look at things. We do examine things. We do it in the spirit of making this country better. We also have to remember who we work for. We work for the American people. The American people are paying the tab. It is their government, and they have the right to know. Updating this piece of legislation is something that, in particular, Congressman Issa sought to do some time ago. He put the wheels in motion and started to draft a good and much-needed bill. Coming together with the ranking member, Mr. Cummings, has made this all possible. We have had some good, vibrant discussions. We had 2 days of hearings in our committee. We heard from citizens. We heard from the media. We heard from a host of people. I think it is fair to say that, in large part, the FOIA, the way it operates now, is broken. I do agree and concur with the ranking member that, if we are going to have such a bombardment of requests, they need to be properly funded and there needs to be the personnel in order to make sure they can fulfill these requests. When appropriation season comes, I want to stand with Mr. Cummings and with others and make sure that it is properly funded so that those good people can do their good work. There were a number of reforms and improvements that needed to happen. I do appreciate the flexibility of working and of offering suggestions and then another set of suggestions. This would not have been possible, Mr. Speaker, without some good work in the Office of Legal Counsel. Sally Walker dealt with us time and time again. On our side of the aisle, we had it spearheaded with Katy Rother, and I know that Krista Boyd particularly, on Mr. Cummings' staff, was vital to making this happen. There are vital pieces of information that are needed and that are rightfully requested by the American people, but this piece of legislation will make that FOIA process smoother. It will make it more effective, more efficient, and I think it is much needed as we go into the 50th year of FOIA. I look forward to its passage. I urge a ``yes'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I close by highlighting a few additional provisions of FOIA. This bill would require agencies to review existing records to identify categories of records to proactively disclose rather than waiting for FOIA requests. The bill would also require the Department of Justice to report to Congress on categories of records that would be appropriate for proactive disclosure. Finally, the bill would tackle the proliferation of statutory FOIA exemptions by requiring the Government Accountability Office to catalog all of the statutory exemptions on the books. Again, I urge the support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the good, bipartisan work. It was through a lot of labor and a lot of listening to what the public needs and to what the media needs. I do think this will make the Freedom of Information Act better as it is the spirit by which we operate in this country. I urge the bill's passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC, January 8, 2016. Hon. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Chaffetz: On January 7, 2016, your committee ordered H.R. 653, the ``FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2015,'' reported. As you know, H.R. 653 contains several provisions that implicate the work of agencies within the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The bill addresses how elements of the Intelligence Community (IC), as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947, may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). On the basis of your consultations with the Committee, I understand that H.R. 653 has been crafted to avoid compelling the disclosure of any properly classified information, or other information where disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing FOIA exemption. In particular, I understand that H.R. 653 does not allow or require FOIA requesters to obtain IC records or information, without regard to the age of the records or information, if such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods. I further understand that H.R. 653 does not alter an Intelligence Community element's discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying records or information sought pursuant to FOIA. Specifically, I understand that the requirement in Section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an Intelligence Community element's discretion regarding the contents of the required ``list.'' To the extent that elaboration of any list would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods, an IC element may cite to the applicable FOIA exemption to meet the list requirement. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming these understandings and would request that you include a copy of this letter in the Congressional Record during its floor consideration. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Devin Nunes, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, January 11, 2016. Hon. Devin Nunes, Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your January 8, 2016, letter regarding H.R. 653, the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2015, as reported. H.R. 653 bill addresses how elements of the Intelligence Community (IC), as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947, may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I am writing to confirm our mutual understanding with respect to the consideration of the bill. H.R. 653 has been crafted to strengthen FOIA by establishing a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, while also recognizing the need to avoid compelling the disclosure of any properly classified information, or other information where disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing FOIA exemption. The bill, as reported, does not require agency FOIA staff to disclose IC records or information, without regard to the age of the records or information, if such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods. Further, the bill does not alter an IC element's discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying records or information sought pursuant to FOIA. Specifically, the requirement in Section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an Intelligence Community element's discretion regarding the contents of the required ``list.'' A copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the will be inserted into the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Jason Chaffetz, Chairman. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 653, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. [[Page H255]] A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H249-H255] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOIA OVERSIGHT AND IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), the former chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and one of the lead sponsors of this bill. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. It is no accident that this is one of the first bills of the new year. Like some of the other legislation, it is not a new idea. In many ways, what it really is is this body, once again, if you will, reiterating when we talk about freedom of information for the American people, whether it is a private citizen who doesn't know what the government knows about him or her and would like to or it is an interest group, a think tank, or very, very often the press--The New York Times, The Washington Post, the LA Times, and a host more--wanting to know what the government is doing, what their government is doing with their money, their freedoms. This bill emphasizes in no uncertain terms something that is long overdue: that the balance between the American people's right to know about their information and the government's right to keep a secret shall always be balanced in favor and presumed to be the American people's right. In other words, no longer, after this bill is signed into law, will an administration, Republican or Democratic, be able to presume that they are going to say no if they possibly can. Instead, this bill shifts the burden to the presumption of yes. Not only does it shift the burden, but it puts an outright mandate that, after 25 years, information not covered by national security requirements or classifications of secret or above, shall, in fact, simply be available. These are fundamentally important distinctions between the current law. But more to the point of a modernization, this legislation mandates a single point of asking for FOIA, an assumption that it is long overdue for us to streamline and improve the ability to get this information and get it to everyone. One of the aspects of the legislation is that H.R. 653 will require that information asked for again and again and again be posted and available for everyone rather than each time being a burden of somebody wanting similar or even identical information to have to put in a FOIA request. Mr. Speaker, what I want to close with is this isn't just bipartisan; this is universal. Members of the House and the Senate, whether there is a Republican or Democratic President, whether it is on behalf of a constituent wanting some simple information, we regularly use the Freedom of Information Act, and we regularly find ourselves frustrated. This is good for the administration. It builds on legislation like the DATA Act and other reforms that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee have done over a number of years. Lastly, I want to thank my good friend from Maryland (Mr. Cummings). From the very day we began heading the committee, more than 5 years ago now, together, he has always been for FOIA reform, always been for more transparency, and always been supportive of the legislation you see here today. I want to thank Mr. Cummings, something that I don't get enough chances to do. And I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz for bringing this bill, not only as it was originally written, but with some important modifications to make it, hopefully, go through quickly when it is considered by the Senate. I urge its support. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 653, the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act. I want to start by thanking Representative Darrell Issa for working with me on this legislation. We first introduced the FOIA Act in March 2013. The bill before us today is the product of 3 years of work--hard work--feedback, negotiation, and perseverance. I also want to thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, for his work on this bill and his strong support for bringing it to the House floor today. I would say that this is a bipartisan effort, but it is more than that. We actually worked very, very hard together, all of us, to make this happen. If there was any case where we had to use this term of not moving to common ground but moving to higher ground, it would be this legislation. Open government advocates--journalists, editorial boards, and everyday citizens--who support this bill also deserve a tremendous amount of gratitude. The FOIA Act would strengthen the cornerstone of our open government laws and the Freedom of Information Act. This legislation builds on the historic work of the Obama administration, which I believe will go down in history as the most transparent administration to date. The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place in a memo issued on his first day in office. The bill would require agencies to identify specific identifiable harm to an interest protected by exemption unless disclosure is prohibited by law. This provision would not require agencies to disclose classified information, it would not require agencies to disclose anything they are prohibited from disclosing by law, and it would not remove any of FOIA's existing time exemptions. It would, however, put the burden on agencies where it should be: to justify keeping government information secret. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset exemption 5 of FOIA--the deliberative process exemption--and limit the scope of records that agencies could withhold under that exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central portal to allow FOIA requests to any agency through one Web site. The Office of Government Information Services, the FOIA ombudsman created by Congress in 2007, would become more independent, which is very important under this bill, because that office would be allowed to submit testimony and reports directly to Congress without going through political review. This bill is coming to the floor with an amendment that makes a number of changes, and many of them proposed by Chairman Chaffetz. Some of these additions include requiring agencies to provide each FOIA requester with a contact name and information for an agency employee who can provide information on the status of the request. This is so very, very important. Our bill has widespread support. A coalition of 47 open government groups sent a letter in support of this bill on February 5, 2015, that said: ``Congress must act this year to ensure that FOIA stays current with people's need to access government information and resilient in the face of attempts to subvert that access.'' {time} 1730 Numerous editorial boards have written, urging Congress to pass FOIA reform legislation. A New York Times editorial from February 2015 reads: ``This is a rare chance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public interest.'' A USA Today editorial in March 2015 called for the enactment of this bill's reforms. A Los Angeles Times editorial read that this legislation and a similar bill in the Senate ``deserves to be passed.'' This is a movement called Fix FOIA by 50. That movement is aimed at getting H.R. 653 enacted before the 50th anniversary of FOIA in July of this year. An online clearinghouse for the movement includes stories from journalists about why FOIA is critical to their work and why this legislation must be enacted. It is important to note that, even with the enactment of this legislation, the work of Congress must continue. Agency FOIA staff are being asked to do more than ever before. From 2009 to [[Page H254]] 2014, the overall number of FOIA requests submitted to Federal agencies increased by 28 percent with new records set in each of the past 4 years in a row. The total number of FOIA personnel, however, decreased by about 4 percent. Congress must give these agencies more resources. Again, I thank Congressman Issa for all of his hard work. I know that he has been on this bill for a long time and has tried to make sure it gets passed. Again, I want to thank both staffs for working so hard. Since Chairman Chaffetz became chairman, we have had two meetings, and I know our staffs have had numerous meetings and have hammered out the details to make a very good bill a better bill. I want to thank them. I urge my colleagues to vote for transparency and for the American people by voting ``yes'' on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a good, much-needed piece of legislation. It is hard to believe that FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act, was passed nearly 50 years ago. We are a little different in the United States. We are self-critical. We do look at things. We do examine things. We do it in the spirit of making this country better. We also have to remember who we work for. We work for the American people. The American people are paying the tab. It is their government, and they have the right to know. Updating this piece of legislation is something that, in particular, Congressman Issa sought to do some time ago. He put the wheels in motion and started to draft a good and much-needed bill. Coming together with the ranking member, Mr. Cummings, has made this all possible. We have had some good, vibrant discussions. We had 2 days of hearings in our committee. We heard from citizens. We heard from the media. We heard from a host of people. I think it is fair to say that, in large part, the FOIA, the way it operates now, is broken. I do agree and concur with the ranking member that, if we are going to have such a bombardment of requests, they need to be properly funded and there needs to be the personnel in order to make sure they can fulfill these requests. When appropriation season comes, I want to stand with Mr. Cummings and with others and make sure that it is properly funded so that those good people can do their good work. There were a number of reforms and improvements that needed to happen. I do appreciate the flexibility of working and of offering suggestions and then another set of suggestions. This would not have been possible, Mr. Speaker, without some good work in the Office of Legal Counsel. Sally Walker dealt with us time and time again. On our side of the aisle, we had it spearheaded with Katy Rother, and I know that Krista Boyd particularly, on Mr. Cummings' staff, was vital to making this happen. There are vital pieces of information that are needed and that are rightfully requested by the American people, but this piece of legislation will make that FOIA process smoother. It will make it more effective, more efficient, and I think it is much needed as we go into the 50th year of FOIA. I look forward to its passage. I urge a ``yes'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I close by highlighting a few additional provisions of FOIA. This bill would require agencies to review existing records to identify categories of records to proactively disclose rather than waiting for FOIA requests. The bill would also require the Department of Justice to report to Congress on categories of records that would be appropriate for proactive disclosure. Finally, the bill would tackle the proliferation of statutory FOIA exemptions by requiring the Government Accountability Office to catalog all of the statutory exemptions on the books. Again, I urge the support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the good, bipartisan work. It was through a lot of labor and a lot of listening to what the public needs and to what the media needs. I do think this will make the Freedom of Information Act better as it is the spirit by which we operate in this country. I urge the bill's passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC, January 8, 2016. Hon. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Chaffetz: On January 7, 2016, your committee ordered H.R. 653, the ``FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2015,'' reported. As you know, H.R. 653 contains several provisions that implicate the work of agencies within the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The bill addresses how elements of the Intelligence Community (IC), as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947, may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). On the basis of your consultations with the Committee, I understand that H.R. 653 has been crafted to avoid compelling the disclosure of any properly classified information, or other information where disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing FOIA exemption. In particular, I understand that H.R. 653 does not allow or require FOIA requesters to obtain IC records or information, without regard to the age of the records or information, if such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods. I further understand that H.R. 653 does not alter an Intelligence Community element's discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying records or information sought pursuant to FOIA. Specifically, I understand that the requirement in Section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an Intelligence Community element's discretion regarding the contents of the required ``list.'' To the extent that elaboration of any list would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods, an IC element may cite to the applicable FOIA exemption to meet the list requirement. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming these understandings and would request that you include a copy of this letter in the Congressional Record during its floor consideration. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Devin Nunes, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, January 11, 2016. Hon. Devin Nunes, Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your January 8, 2016, letter regarding H.R. 653, the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2015, as reported. H.R. 653 bill addresses how elements of the Intelligence Community (IC), as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947, may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I am writing to confirm our mutual understanding with respect to the consideration of the bill. H.R. 653 has been crafted to strengthen FOIA by establishing a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, while also recognizing the need to avoid compelling the disclosure of any properly classified information, or other information where disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing FOIA exemption. The bill, as reported, does not require agency FOIA staff to disclose IC records or information, without regard to the age of the records or information, if such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods. Further, the bill does not alter an IC element's discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying records or information sought pursuant to FOIA. Specifically, the requirement in Section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an Intelligence Community element's discretion regarding the contents of the required ``list.'' A copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the will be inserted into the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Jason Chaffetz, Chairman. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 653, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. [[Page H255]] A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H249-H255] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOIA OVERSIGHT AND IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each will control 20 minutes. [[Page H253]] The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), the former chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and one of the lead sponsors of this bill. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. It is no accident that this is one of the first bills of the new year. Like some of the other legislation, it is not a new idea. In many ways, what it really is is this body, once again, if you will, reiterating when we talk about freedom of information for the American people, whether it is a private citizen who doesn't know what the government knows about him or her and would like to or it is an interest group, a think tank, or very, very often the press--The New York Times, The Washington Post, the LA Times, and a host more--wanting to know what the government is doing, what their government is doing with their money, their freedoms. This bill emphasizes in no uncertain terms something that is long overdue: that the balance between the American people's right to know about their information and the government's right to keep a secret shall always be balanced in favor and presumed to be the American people's right. In other words, no longer, after this bill is signed into law, will an administration, Republican or Democratic, be able to presume that they are going to say no if they possibly can. Instead, this bill shifts the burden to the presumption of yes. Not only does it shift the burden, but it puts an outright mandate that, after 25 years, information not covered by national security requirements or classifications of secret or above, shall, in fact, simply be available. These are fundamentally important distinctions between the current law. But more to the point of a modernization, this legislation mandates a single point of asking for FOIA, an assumption that it is long overdue for us to streamline and improve the ability to get this information and get it to everyone. One of the aspects of the legislation is that H.R. 653 will require that information asked for again and again and again be posted and available for everyone rather than each time being a burden of somebody wanting similar or even identical information to have to put in a FOIA request. Mr. Speaker, what I want to close with is this isn't just bipartisan; this is universal. Members of the House and the Senate, whether there is a Republican or Democratic President, whether it is on behalf of a constituent wanting some simple information, we regularly use the Freedom of Information Act, and we regularly find ourselves frustrated. This is good for the administration. It builds on legislation like the DATA Act and other reforms that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee have done over a number of years. Lastly, I want to thank my good friend from Maryland (Mr. Cummings). From the very day we began heading the committee, more than 5 years ago now, together, he has always been for FOIA reform, always been for more transparency, and always been supportive of the legislation you see here today. I want to thank Mr. Cummings, something that I don't get enough chances to do. And I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz for bringing this bill, not only as it was originally written, but with some important modifications to make it, hopefully, go through quickly when it is considered by the Senate. I urge its support. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 653, the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act. I want to start by thanking Representative Darrell Issa for working with me on this legislation. We first introduced the FOIA Act in March 2013. The bill before us today is the product of 3 years of work--hard work--feedback, negotiation, and perseverance. I also want to thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, for his work on this bill and his strong support for bringing it to the House floor today. I would say that this is a bipartisan effort, but it is more than that. We actually worked very, very hard together, all of us, to make this happen. If there was any case where we had to use this term of not moving to common ground but moving to higher ground, it would be this legislation. Open government advocates--journalists, editorial boards, and everyday citizens--who support this bill also deserve a tremendous amount of gratitude. The FOIA Act would strengthen the cornerstone of our open government laws and the Freedom of Information Act. This legislation builds on the historic work of the Obama administration, which I believe will go down in history as the most transparent administration to date. The bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama put in place in a memo issued on his first day in office. The bill would require agencies to identify specific identifiable harm to an interest protected by exemption unless disclosure is prohibited by law. This provision would not require agencies to disclose classified information, it would not require agencies to disclose anything they are prohibited from disclosing by law, and it would not remove any of FOIA's existing time exemptions. It would, however, put the burden on agencies where it should be: to justify keeping government information secret. The bill would also put a 25-year sunset exemption 5 of FOIA--the deliberative process exemption--and limit the scope of records that agencies could withhold under that exemption. It would modernize FOIA by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central portal to allow FOIA requests to any agency through one Web site. The Office of Government Information Services, the FOIA ombudsman created by Congress in 2007, would become more independent, which is very important under this bill, because that office would be allowed to submit testimony and reports directly to Congress without going through political review. This bill is coming to the floor with an amendment that makes a number of changes, and many of them proposed by Chairman Chaffetz. Some of these additions include requiring agencies to provide each FOIA requester with a contact name and information for an agency employee who can provide information on the status of the request. This is so very, very important. Our bill has widespread support. A coalition of 47 open government groups sent a letter in support of this bill on February 5, 2015, that said: ``Congress must act this year to ensure that FOIA stays current with people's need to access government information and resilient in the face of attempts to subvert that access.'' {time} 1730 Numerous editorial boards have written, urging Congress to pass FOIA reform legislation. A New York Times editorial from February 2015 reads: ``This is a rare chance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public interest.'' A USA Today editorial in March 2015 called for the enactment of this bill's reforms. A Los Angeles Times editorial read that this legislation and a similar bill in the Senate ``deserves to be passed.'' This is a movement called Fix FOIA by 50. That movement is aimed at getting H.R. 653 enacted before the 50th anniversary of FOIA in July of this year. An online clearinghouse for the movement includes stories from journalists about why FOIA is critical to their work and why this legislation must be enacted. It is important to note that, even with the enactment of this legislation, the work of Congress must continue. Agency FOIA staff are being asked to do more than ever before. From 2009 to [[Page H254]] 2014, the overall number of FOIA requests submitted to Federal agencies increased by 28 percent with new records set in each of the past 4 years in a row. The total number of FOIA personnel, however, decreased by about 4 percent. Congress must give these agencies more resources. Again, I thank Congressman Issa for all of his hard work. I know that he has been on this bill for a long time and has tried to make sure it gets passed. Again, I want to thank both staffs for working so hard. Since Chairman Chaffetz became chairman, we have had two meetings, and I know our staffs have had numerous meetings and have hammered out the details to make a very good bill a better bill. I want to thank them. I urge my colleagues to vote for transparency and for the American people by voting ``yes'' on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a good, much-needed piece of legislation. It is hard to believe that FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act, was passed nearly 50 years ago. We are a little different in the United States. We are self-critical. We do look at things. We do examine things. We do it in the spirit of making this country better. We also have to remember who we work for. We work for the American people. The American people are paying the tab. It is their government, and they have the right to know. Updating this piece of legislation is something that, in particular, Congressman Issa sought to do some time ago. He put the wheels in motion and started to draft a good and much-needed bill. Coming together with the ranking member, Mr. Cummings, has made this all possible. We have had some good, vibrant discussions. We had 2 days of hearings in our committee. We heard from citizens. We heard from the media. We heard from a host of people. I think it is fair to say that, in large part, the FOIA, the way it operates now, is broken. I do agree and concur with the ranking member that, if we are going to have such a bombardment of requests, they need to be properly funded and there needs to be the personnel in order to make sure they can fulfill these requests. When appropriation season comes, I want to stand with Mr. Cummings and with others and make sure that it is properly funded so that those good people can do their good work. There were a number of reforms and improvements that needed to happen. I do appreciate the flexibility of working and of offering suggestions and then another set of suggestions. This would not have been possible, Mr. Speaker, without some good work in the Office of Legal Counsel. Sally Walker dealt with us time and time again. On our side of the aisle, we had it spearheaded with Katy Rother, and I know that Krista Boyd particularly, on Mr. Cummings' staff, was vital to making this happen. There are vital pieces of information that are needed and that are rightfully requested by the American people, but this piece of legislation will make that FOIA process smoother. It will make it more effective, more efficient, and I think it is much needed as we go into the 50th year of FOIA. I look forward to its passage. I urge a ``yes'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I close by highlighting a few additional provisions of FOIA. This bill would require agencies to review existing records to identify categories of records to proactively disclose rather than waiting for FOIA requests. The bill would also require the Department of Justice to report to Congress on categories of records that would be appropriate for proactive disclosure. Finally, the bill would tackle the proliferation of statutory FOIA exemptions by requiring the Government Accountability Office to catalog all of the statutory exemptions on the books. Again, I urge the support of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the good, bipartisan work. It was through a lot of labor and a lot of listening to what the public needs and to what the media needs. I do think this will make the Freedom of Information Act better as it is the spirit by which we operate in this country. I urge the bill's passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC, January 8, 2016. Hon. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Chaffetz: On January 7, 2016, your committee ordered H.R. 653, the ``FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2015,'' reported. As you know, H.R. 653 contains several provisions that implicate the work of agencies within the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The bill addresses how elements of the Intelligence Community (IC), as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947, may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). On the basis of your consultations with the Committee, I understand that H.R. 653 has been crafted to avoid compelling the disclosure of any properly classified information, or other information where disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing FOIA exemption. In particular, I understand that H.R. 653 does not allow or require FOIA requesters to obtain IC records or information, without regard to the age of the records or information, if such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods. I further understand that H.R. 653 does not alter an Intelligence Community element's discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying records or information sought pursuant to FOIA. Specifically, I understand that the requirement in Section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an Intelligence Community element's discretion regarding the contents of the required ``list.'' To the extent that elaboration of any list would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods, an IC element may cite to the applicable FOIA exemption to meet the list requirement. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming these understandings and would request that you include a copy of this letter in the Congressional Record during its floor consideration. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Devin Nunes, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, January 11, 2016. Hon. Devin Nunes, Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your January 8, 2016, letter regarding H.R. 653, the FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2015, as reported. H.R. 653 bill addresses how elements of the Intelligence Community (IC), as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947, may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I am writing to confirm our mutual understanding with respect to the consideration of the bill. H.R. 653 has been crafted to strengthen FOIA by establishing a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, while also recognizing the need to avoid compelling the disclosure of any properly classified information, or other information where disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing FOIA exemption. The bill, as reported, does not require agency FOIA staff to disclose IC records or information, without regard to the age of the records or information, if such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods. Further, the bill does not alter an IC element's discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying records or information sought pursuant to FOIA. Specifically, the requirement in Section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an Intelligence Community element's discretion regarding the contents of the required ``list.'' A copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the will be inserted into the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Jason Chaffetz, Chairman. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 653, as amended.

chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. issa), the former chairman of the oversight and government reform committee and one of the lead sponsors of this bill. mr. issa. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman. it is no accident that this is one of the first bills of the new year. like some of the other legislation, it is not a new idea. in many ways, what it really is is this body, once again, if you will, reiterating when we talk about freedom of information for the american people, whether it is a private citizen who doesn't know what the government knows about him or her and would like to or it is an interest group, a think tank, or very, very often the press--the new york times, the washington post, the la times, and a host more--wanting to know what the government is doing, what their government is doing with their money, their freedoms. this bill emphasizes in no uncertain terms something that is long overdue: that the balance between the american people's right to know about their information and the government's right to keep a secret shall always be balanced in favor and presumed to be the american people's right. in other words, no longer, after this bill is signed into law, will an administration, republican or democratic, be able to presume that they are going to say no if they possibly can. instead, this bill shifts the burden to the presumption of yes. not only does it shift the burden, but it puts an outright mandate that, after 25 years, information not covered by national security requirements or classifications of secret or above, shall, in fact, simply be available. these are fundamentally important distinctions between the current law. but more to the point of a modernization, this legislation mandates a single point of asking for foia, an assumption that it is long overdue for us to streamline and improve the ability to get this information and get it to everyone. one of the aspects of the legislation is that h.r. 653 will require that information asked for again and again and again be posted and available for everyone rather than each time being a burden of somebody wanting similar or even identical information to have to put in a foia request. mr. speaker, what i want to close with is this isn't just bipartisan; this is universal. members of the house and the senate, whether there is a republican or democratic president, whether it is on behalf of a constituent wanting some simple information, we regularly use the freedom of information act, and we regularly find ourselves frustrated. this is good for the administration. it builds on legislation like the data act and other reforms that the oversight and government reform committee have done over a number of years. lastly, i want to thank my good friend from maryland (mr. cummings). from the very day we began heading the committee, more than 5 years ago now, together, he has always been for foia reform, always been for more transparency, and always been supportive of the legislation you see here today. i want to thank mr. cummings, something that i don't get enough chances to do. and i want to thank chairman chaffetz for bringing this bill, not only as it was originally written, but with some important modifications to make it, hopefully, go through quickly when it is considered by the senate. i urge its support. mr. cummings. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 653, the foia oversight and implementation act. i want to start by thanking representative darrell issa for working with me on this legislation. we first introduced the foia act in march 2013. the bill before us today is the product of 3 years of work--hard work--feedback, negotiation, and perseverance. i also want to thank the chairman of the oversight and government reform committee, jason chaffetz, for his work on this bill and his strong support for bringing it to the house floor today. i would say that this is a bipartisan effort, but it is more than that. we actually worked very, very hard together, all of us, to make this happen. if there was any case where we had to use this term of not moving to common ground but moving to higher ground, it would be this legislation. open government advocates--journalists, editorial boards, and everyday citizens--who support this bill also deserve a tremendous amount of gratitude. the foia act would strengthen the cornerstone of our open government laws and the freedom of information act. this legislation builds on the historic work of the obama administration, which i believe will go down in history as the most transparent administration to date. the bill would codify the presumption of openness standard that president obama put in place in a memo issued on his first day in office. the bill would require agencies to identify specific identifiable harm to an interest protected by exemption unless disclosure is prohibited by law. this provision would not require agencies to disclose classified information, it would not require agencies to disclose anything they are prohibited from disclosing by law, and it would not remove any of foia's existing time exemptions. it would, however, put the burden on agencies where it should be: to justify keeping government information secret. the bill would also put a 25-year sunset exemption 5 of foia--the deliberative process exemption--and limit the scope of records that agencies could withhold under that exemption. it would modernize foia by requiring the office of management and budget to create a central portal to allow foia requests to any agency through one web site. the office of government information services, the foia ombudsman created by congress in 2007, would become more independent, which is very important under this bill, because that office would be allowed to submit testimony and reports directly to congress without going through political review. this bill is coming to the floor with an amendment that makes a number of changes, and many of them proposed by chairman chaffetz. some of these additions include requiring agencies to provide each foia requester with a contact name and information for an agency employee who can provide information on the status of the request. this is so very, very important. our bill has widespread support. a coalition of 47 open government groups sent a letter in support of this bill on february 5, 2015, that said: ``congress must act this year to ensure that foia stays current with people's need to access government information and resilient in the face of attempts to subvert that access.'' {time} 1730 numerous editorial boards have written, urging congress to pass foia reform legislation. a new york times editorial from february 2015 reads: ``this is a rare chance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public interest.'' a usa today editorial in march 2015 called for the enactment of this bill's reforms. a los angeles times editorial read that this legislation and a similar bill in the senate ``deserves to be passed.'' this is a movement called fix foia by 50. that movement is aimed at getting h.r. 653 enacted before the 50th anniversary of foia in july of this year. an online clearinghouse for the movement includes stories from journalists about why foia is critical to their work and why this legislation must be enacted. it is important to note that, even with the enactment of this legislation, the work of congress must continue. agency foia staff are being asked to do more than ever before. from 2009 to [[page h254]] 2014, the overall number of foia requests submitted to federal agencies increased by 28 percent with new records set in each of the past 4 years in a row. the total number of foia personnel, however, decreased by about 4 percent. congress must give these agencies more resources. again, i thank congressman issa for all of his hard work. i know that he has been on this bill for a long time and has tried to make sure it gets passed. again, i want to thank both staffs for working so hard. since chairman chaffetz became chairman, we have had two meetings, and i know our staffs have had numerous meetings and have hammered out the details to make a very good bill a better bill. i want to thank them. i urge my colleagues to vote for transparency and for the american people by voting ``yes'' on this legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. this is a good, much-needed piece of legislation. it is hard to believe that foia, the freedom of information act, was passed nearly 50 years ago. we are a little different in the united states. we are self-critical. we do look at things. we do examine things. we do it in the spirit of making this country better. we also have to remember who we work for. we work for the american people. the american people are paying the tab. it is their government, and they have the right to know. updating this piece of legislation is something that, in particular, congressman issa sought to do some time ago. he put the wheels in motion and started to draft a good and much-needed bill. coming together with the ranking member, mr. cummings, has made this all possible. we have had some good, vibrant discussions. we had 2 days of hearings in our committee. we heard from citizens. we heard from the media. we heard from a host of people. i think it is fair to say that, in large part, the foia, the way it operates now, is broken. i do agree and concur with the ranking member that, if we are going to have such a bombardment of requests, they need to be properly funded and there needs to be the personnel in order to make sure they can fulfill these requests. when appropriation season comes, i want to stand with mr. cummings and with others and make sure that it is properly funded so that those good people can do their good work. there were a number of reforms and improvements that needed to happen. i do appreciate the flexibility of working and of offering suggestions and then another set of suggestions. this would not have been possible, mr. speaker, without some good work in the office of legal counsel. sally walker dealt with us time and time again. on our side of the aisle, we had it spearheaded with katy rother, and i know that krista boyd particularly, on mr. cummings' staff, was vital to making this happen. there are vital pieces of information that are needed and that are rightfully requested by the american people, but this piece of legislation will make that foia process smoother. it will make it more effective, more efficient, and i think it is much needed as we go into the 50th year of foia. i look forward to its passage. i urge a ``yes'' vote. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. cummings. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i close by highlighting a few additional provisions of foia. this bill would require agencies to review existing records to identify categories of records to proactively disclose rather than waiting for foia requests. the bill would also require the department of justice to report to congress on categories of records that would be appropriate for proactive disclosure. finally, the bill would tackle the proliferation of statutory foia exemptions by requiring the government accountability office to catalog all of the statutory exemptions on the books. again, i urge the support of this legislation. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i appreciate the good, bipartisan work. it was through a lot of labor and a lot of listening to what the public needs and to what the media needs. i do think this will make the freedom of information act better as it is the spirit by which we operate in this country. i urge the bill's passage. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. house of representatives, permanent select committee on intelligence, washington, dc, january 8, 2016. hon. jason chaffetz, chairman, committee on oversight and government reform , washington, dc. dear chairman chaffetz: on january 7, 2016, your committee ordered h.r. 653, the ``foia oversight and implementation act of 2015,'' reported. as you know, h.r. 653 contains several provisions that implicate the work of agencies within the jurisdiction of the permanent select committee on intelligence. the bill addresses how elements of the intelligence community (ic), as defined in section 3(4) of the national security act of 1947, may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the freedom of information act (foia). on the basis of your consultations with the committee, i understand that h.r. 653 has been crafted to avoid compelling the disclosure of any properly classified information, or other information where disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing foia exemption. in particular, i understand that h.r. 653 does not allow or require foia requesters to obtain ic records or information, without regard to the age of the records or information, if such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods. i further understand that h.r. 653 does not alter an intelligence community element's discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying records or information sought pursuant to foia. specifically, i understand that the requirement in section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an intelligence community element's discretion regarding the contents of the required ``list.'' to the extent that elaboration of any list would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods, an ic element may cite to the applicable foia exemption to meet the list requirement. i would appreciate your response to this letter confirming these understandings and would request that you include a copy of this letter in the congressional record during its floor consideration. thank you in advance for your cooperation. sincerely, devin nunes, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on oversight and government reform, washington, dc, january 11, 2016. hon. devin nunes, chairman, permanent select committee on intelligence, washington, dc. dear mr. chairman: thank you for your january 8, 2016, letter regarding h.r. 653, the foia oversight and implementation act of 2015, as reported. h.r. 653 bill addresses how elements of the intelligence community (ic), as defined in section 3(4) of the national security act of 1947, may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the freedom of information act (foia). i am writing to confirm our mutual understanding with respect to the consideration of the bill. h.r. 653 has been crafted to strengthen foia by establishing a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, while also recognizing the need to avoid compelling the disclosure of any properly classified information, or other information where disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing foia exemption. the bill, as reported, does not require agency foia staff to disclose ic records or information, without regard to the age of the records or information, if such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources and methods. further, the bill does not alter an ic element's discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying records or information sought pursuant to foia. specifically, the requirement in section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an intelligence community element's discretion regarding the contents of the required ``list.'' a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the will be inserted into the congressional record during consideration of this bill on the house floor. thank you for your attention to this matter. sincerely, jason chaffetz, chairman. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 653, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. [[page h255]] a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",52881

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3231) to amend title 5, United States Code, to protect unpaid interns in the Federal government from workplace harassment and discrimination, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3231 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. PROHIBITED PERSONNEL PRACTICES. (a) In General.--Section 2302 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(g)(1) All protections afforded to an employee under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D) of subsection (b)(1) shall be afforded, in the same manner and to the same extent, to an intern and an applicant for internship. ``(2) For purposes of the application of this subsection, a reference to an employee shall be considered a reference to an intern in-- ``(A) section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16); ``(B) sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a); and ``(C) section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791). ``(3) In this subsection, the term `intern' means an individual who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution or to learn a trade or occupation.''. (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 3111(c)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting ``section 2302(g) (relating to prohibited personnel practices),'' before ``chapter 81''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015, as introduced by the ranking member, Mr. Cummings. This is a bill brought to my attention by him. We took it through the process in our committee and marked it up, and here we are on the floor. The bill establishes some important protections against the workplace discrimination and harassment of both unpaid Federal interns and applicants for Federal internships. Currently, there are no specific provisions in law to protect these unpaid interns. H.R. 3231 makes it illegal to discriminate, to sexually harass, or to retaliate against unpaid Federal interns and applicants for Federal internships. Specifically, the bill protects against discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin under the Civil Rights Act of 1967, under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and under the handicapping condition under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Unpaid interns, similar to paid employees, are to be considered protected against discrimination and harassment. I thank Mr. Cummings for his passion on this issue to guard against this discrimination and harassment. I look forward to supporting this bill. I am glad we could bring it to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The bill before us, the Federal Intern Protection Act, would close a loophole in Federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns open to discrimination and sexual harassment. Earlier this year our committee held a hearing at which we heard testimony about sexual harassment and retaliation in an EPA regional office. During that hearing, both Chairman Chaffetz and I expressed our disgust at the exploitation of these young women and demanded that action be taken to prevent this in the future. Unfortunately, the act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of race, religion, age, or, in this case, sex is not prohibited by Federal law. Under current law, victims rely on the discretion of managers to prevent the recurrence of this behavior, something that does not always occur. As one witness testified: ``Even after finding out about the numerous harassment victims, the direct reporting manager continued to feed the harasser a steady diet of young women.'' As we saw at our hearing, allowing this kind of behavior to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of those who are interested in government service and on those who are simply trying to be all that God meant for them to be. There are many unpaid interns who are willing to commit to working for the Federal Government. We should protect them from this kind of despicable behavior. I want to take a moment to thank Chairman Chaffetz for helping us to move this bill through the committee expeditiously and to bring it to the floor. As a matter of fact, in our committee, we received a unanimous vote on it, and I am hoping that there will be a unanimous vote on the floor today. I thank him and I thank his staff and our staff for pulling all of this together to get us to this moment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act. This bill would amend title 5 of the U.S. Code to extend protections against discrimination and harassment to unpaid interns who work at Federal agencies. The bill would define an intern as someone who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution or to learn a trade or occupation. Internships are often the first real entry into a profession; yet, unpaid interns are not expressly protected from the discriminatory practices prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and other laws and regulations. This bill would remedy this problem and extend those workplace protections to unpaid interns who may be vulnerable to egregious treatment. Madam Speaker, all too often, when unpaid interns have taken cases of workplace discrimination to the courts, the courts have ruled against them. In the Second Circuit, a unanimous panel of judges concluded that unpaid interns are not employees covered by existing laws. In the 1997 case of O'Connor v. Davis, an employee at a State hospital harassed an unpaid intern, calling her Miss Sexual Harassment and subjecting her to sexually explicit comments. The court stated that it was not unsympathetic to O'Connor's situation and acknowledged that she was not in quite the same position to simply walk away from the alleged harassment, as her success at school was dependent on her successfully completing her internship. The Second Circuit noted that Ms. O'Connor's dependency on her employer made her vulnerable to continued harassment much as an employee dependent on a regular wage can be vulnerable to ongoing misconduct. Despite that, the Second Circuit concluded: ``It is for Congress, if it should choose to do so, and not this court to provide a remedy under either title VII or title IX for plaintiffs in O'Connor's position.'' As ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I urge Congress to do more to protect unpaid interns, be it in the Federal sector, in the Halls of Congress, or in the private sector. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has jurisdiction [[Page H256]] over legislation that strengthens worker protections and defends the civil rights laws of workers, including fighting against discrimination and supporting diversity in the workplace. Now that the House is about to complete the consideration of H.R. 3231, covering Federal workers, I am calling on the leadership of the Committee on Education and the Workforce to move expeditiously to consider the companion legislation, H.R. 3232, the Unpaid Intern Protection Act. That bill would ensure that unpaid interns in the private sector are free from discrimination and harassment as prohibited by the Civil Rights Act. {time} 1745 Extending workplace protections to nonpaid interns, who under current law lack the protections provided by civil rights laws, should be a priority for the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and that is because internships have become such an important part of the workforce. According to the 2014 State of Internships Report from a college intern database, InternMatch, about two-thirds of interns surveyed said internships were important for long-term career advancement and about the same number even stated that internships should be mandatory. Student surveys showed that over 60 percent want to intern in the private sector, about 14 percent in the government sector, and 19 percent in nonprofit organizations. As Members of Congress, our position should be clear. Regardless of whether an internship is at a Federal agency, on Capitol Hill, or at a Fortune 500 company, we must ensure that the unpaid status of interns does not leave them without a remedy when their civil rights are violated. To that end, we should begin by passing H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act. We should then start working on legislation to provide similar protections to unpaid interns who work in the private sector. I want to thank Ranking Member Cummings for his leadership on this bill, along with my fellow cosponsors, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng) and the Delegate from Washington, D.C. (Ms. Norton). I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, there are some good young people who are getting their education. They are excited. They have their whole life in front of them. They get this amazing opportunity to do this internship. Maybe it is a month, maybe it is 3 months, maybe it is 6 months. It is just a limited portion of time. That is where they are going to get a base of knowledge and experience that they are going to be able then to parlay and take into the workforce. It is going to help shape and mold their futures. As Members, every one of us rely on interns. We have them in our offices in our districts and we have them in our offices in Washington, D.C. We see them in the private sector. We see them all over the place. They provide a valuable role. Unfortunately, there are some young people--and we have heard these stories, and they are horrific--who go into this situation, and somebody in power, somebody who does get a paycheck, somebody who does control their time, does ask them to do tasks--does the unforgivable and asks them--or does something to them that they should never do. To hear this story that there isn't a law on the books so the courts can help take care of it, that is just not an excuse. We do a lot of things in this body, and I would like to think this is one of the really good things that we do here today, is pass a piece of legislation like this so we can protect these young people, because if somebody does break the law and does go forward and does do something unforgivable, they have some recourse. If we are going to take their time and we are going to use the resources of these young people, those people in charge should be held accountable. I think that is the good we are doing here today. So to those particularly young women--I am sure there are young men out there too, I just haven't heard as many of their stories--to those young women, at least, I hope we are listening and we are doing something good. That is why I encourage the passage of this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng), one of the cosponsors of this bill. Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express strong support for H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015. Madam Speaker, internships are increasingly considered a resume necessity for entry-level positions in both the public and private sector. More and more, businesses, organizations, and government agencies consider internships a prerequisite experience to full-time employment. In fact, on college campuses across this country, career service officers push their students to obtain competitive internships because they provide valuable professional experiences and are considered essential. What we often forget is that unpaid interns are amongst the most vulnerable of workers. They need these internships to succeed in their careers. Yet, they are powerless to protect themselves from discrimination and sexual harassment. Facing these challenges can be devastating to young interns at the beginning of their careers. One year ago, a brave and intelligent young woman, Christina, came to my district office to talk to me about her experiences as an unpaid intern. Christina had faced sexual harassment. She had no legal recourse, but she refused to stay silent. She came to my office with a fellow college student, Anna. They told me about the experiences of many young college students who had faced sexual harassment as unpaid interns. I stand here on their behalf today because we can do something about this. State legislatures across this country have started to listen. New York, Oregon, Illinois, California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and New York City have all passed some form of protection for unpaid interns. Unpaid internships in Federal agencies, in particular, are coveted and competitive positions. The Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015 directly addresses this vulnerability by extending existing Federal protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to unpaid interns working for the Federal Government. We can provide vulnerable interns in the Federal Government with the protections they deserve. I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Cummings, for his leadership on this issue. I also thank Representative Scott of Virginia and Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton and their staff for all of their hard work. Mr. CHAFFETZ. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume as I close. Madam Speaker, there have been several cases where interns have tried to bring suit and the courts have said that you have no remedy. Chairman Chaffetz is absolutely right. It is sad when you can have such an egregious act but no remedy. I think one of the most frustrating things for anyone is when they have been harmed or when they have been treated wrongfully and there is no remedy, there is a problem. The courts have said over and over again: Congress, if you want there to be a remedy, then you have to act. That is exactly what we are doing today. I think it says a lot for us as a Congress, and I think it says a lot for us as a Nation. Going back to some of the words of Chairman Chaffetz, when we look at unpaid interns, they do come to these offices trying to get experience and trying to learn the duties and the responsibilities of a certain job. They realize that by doing this, it may very well change in a positive way the trajectory of their destiny. They come in with those high expectations, only to have them destroyed. Sometimes the damage can last not for a day or for a week, but for a lifetime. Then there is another piece that I think a lot of people don't think about, and that is that it is not always the deed, but it is also the memory of having gone through these types of incidents. I think this is a very important piece of legislation. I would urge my colleagues to vote for it. Again, I thank the chairman, because we sat there in a hearing and we heard about a very bad case. A lot of people wonder about the value of hearings [[Page H257]] sometimes, but out of that hearing came this legislation. So, again, I thank the chairman for all of his hard work in helping us get the bill to the floor. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the kind words, and I appreciate the dedication and commitment of Mr. Cummings, Mr. Scott of Virginia, and others who care deeply about this. I do as well. To be able to play a role to help shepherd it to this point is an honor and a privilege. I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3231, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H255-H257] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEDERAL INTERN PROTECTION ACT OF 2015 Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3231) to amend title 5, United States Code, to protect unpaid interns in the Federal government from workplace harassment and discrimination, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3231 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. PROHIBITED PERSONNEL PRACTICES. (a) In General.--Section 2302 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(g)(1) All protections afforded to an employee under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D) of subsection (b)(1) shall be afforded, in the same manner and to the same extent, to an intern and an applicant for internship. ``(2) For purposes of the application of this subsection, a reference to an employee shall be considered a reference to an intern in-- ``(A) section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16); ``(B) sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a); and ``(C) section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791). ``(3) In this subsection, the term `intern' means an individual who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution or to learn a trade or occupation.''. (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 3111(c)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting ``section 2302(g) (relating to prohibited personnel practices),'' before ``chapter 81''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015, as introduced by the ranking member, Mr. Cummings. This is a bill brought to my attention by him. We took it through the process in our committee and marked it up, and here we are on the floor. The bill establishes some important protections against the workplace discrimination and harassment of both unpaid Federal interns and applicants for Federal internships. Currently, there are no specific provisions in law to protect these unpaid interns. H.R. 3231 makes it illegal to discriminate, to sexually harass, or to retaliate against unpaid Federal interns and applicants for Federal internships. Specifically, the bill protects against discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin under the Civil Rights Act of 1967, under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and under the handicapping condition under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Unpaid interns, similar to paid employees, are to be considered protected against discrimination and harassment. I thank Mr. Cummings for his passion on this issue to guard against this discrimination and harassment. I look forward to supporting this bill. I am glad we could bring it to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The bill before us, the Federal Intern Protection Act, would close a loophole in Federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns open to discrimination and sexual harassment. Earlier this year our committee held a hearing at which we heard testimony about sexual harassment and retaliation in an EPA regional office. During that hearing, both Chairman Chaffetz and I expressed our disgust at the exploitation of these young women and demanded that action be taken to prevent this in the future. Unfortunately, the act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of race, religion, age, or, in this case, sex is not prohibited by Federal law. Under current law, victims rely on the discretion of managers to prevent the recurrence of this behavior, something that does not always occur. As one witness testified: ``Even after finding out about the numerous harassment victims, the direct reporting manager continued to feed the harasser a steady diet of young women.'' As we saw at our hearing, allowing this kind of behavior to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of those who are interested in government service and on those who are simply trying to be all that God meant for them to be. There are many unpaid interns who are willing to commit to working for the Federal Government. We should protect them from this kind of despicable behavior. I want to take a moment to thank Chairman Chaffetz for helping us to move this bill through the committee expeditiously and to bring it to the floor. As a matter of fact, in our committee, we received a unanimous vote on it, and I am hoping that there will be a unanimous vote on the floor today. I thank him and I thank his staff and our staff for pulling all of this together to get us to this moment. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott). Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act. This bill would amend title 5 of the U.S. Code to extend protections against discrimination and harassment to unpaid interns who work at Federal agencies. The bill would define an intern as someone who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution or to learn a trade or occupation. Internships are often the first real entry into a profession; yet, unpaid interns are not expressly protected from the discriminatory practices prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and other laws and regulations. This bill would remedy this problem and extend those workplace protections to unpaid interns who may be vulnerable to egregious treatment. Madam Speaker, all too often, when unpaid interns have taken cases of workplace discrimination to the courts, the courts have ruled against them. In the Second Circuit, a unanimous panel of judges concluded that unpaid interns are not employees covered by existing laws. In the 1997 case of O'Connor v. Davis, an employee at a State hospital harassed an unpaid intern, calling her Miss Sexual Harassment and subjecting her to sexually explicit comments. The court stated that it was not unsympathetic to O'Connor's situation and acknowledged that she was not in quite the same position to simply walk away from the alleged harassment, as her success at school was dependent on her successfully completing her internship. The Second Circuit noted that Ms. O'Connor's dependency on her employer made her vulnerable to continued harassment much as an employee dependent on a regular wage can be vulnerable to ongoing misconduct. Despite that, the Second Circuit concluded: ``It is for Congress, if it should choose to do so, and not this court to provide a remedy under either title VII or title IX for plaintiffs in O'Connor's position.'' As ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I urge Congress to do more to protect unpaid interns, be it in the Federal sector, in the Halls of Congress, or in the private sector. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has jurisdiction [[Page H256]] over legislation that strengthens worker protections and defends the civil rights laws of workers, including fighting against discrimination and supporting diversity in the workplace. Now that the House is about to complete the consideration of H.R. 3231, covering Federal workers, I am calling on the leadership of the Committee on Education and the Workforce to move expeditiously to consider the companion legislation, H.R. 3232, the Unpaid Intern Protection Act. That bill would ensure that unpaid interns in the private sector are free from discrimination and harassment as prohibited by the Civil Rights Act. {time} 1745 Extending workplace protections to nonpaid interns, who under current law lack the protections provided by civil rights laws, should be a priority for the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and that is because internships have become such an important part of the workforce. According to the 2014 State of Internships Report from a college intern database, InternMatch, about two-thirds of interns surveyed said internships were important for long-term career advancement and about the same number even stated that internships should be mandatory. Student surveys showed that over 60 percent want to intern in the private sector, about 14 percent in the government sector, and 19 percent in nonprofit organizations. As Members of Congress, our position should be clear. Regardless of whether an internship is at a Federal agency, on Capitol Hill, or at a Fortune 500 company, we must ensure that the unpaid status of interns does not leave them without a remedy when their civil rights are violated. To that end, we should begin by passing H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act. We should then start working on legislation to provide similar protections to unpaid interns who work in the private sector. I want to thank Ranking Member Cummings for his leadership on this bill, along with my fellow cosponsors, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng) and the Delegate from Washington, D.C. (Ms. Norton). I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, there are some good young people who are getting their education. They are excited. They have their whole life in front of them. They get this amazing opportunity to do this internship. Maybe it is a month, maybe it is 3 months, maybe it is 6 months. It is just a limited portion of time. That is where they are going to get a base of knowledge and experience that they are going to be able then to parlay and take into the workforce. It is going to help shape and mold their futures. As Members, every one of us rely on interns. We have them in our offices in our districts and we have them in our offices in Washington, D.C. We see them in the private sector. We see them all over the place. They provide a valuable role. Unfortunately, there are some young people--and we have heard these stories, and they are horrific--who go into this situation, and somebody in power, somebody who does get a paycheck, somebody who does control their time, does ask them to do tasks--does the unforgivable and asks them--or does something to them that they should never do. To hear this story that there isn't a law on the books so the courts can help take care of it, that is just not an excuse. We do a lot of things in this body, and I would like to think this is one of the really good things that we do here today, is pass a piece of legislation like this so we can protect these young people, because if somebody does break the law and does go forward and does do something unforgivable, they have some recourse. If we are going to take their time and we are going to use the resources of these young people, those people in charge should be held accountable. I think that is the good we are doing here today. So to those particularly young women--I am sure there are young men out there too, I just haven't heard as many of their stories--to those young women, at least, I hope we are listening and we are doing something good. That is why I encourage the passage of this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng), one of the cosponsors of this bill. Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express strong support for H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015. Madam Speaker, internships are increasingly considered a resume necessity for entry-level positions in both the public and private sector. More and more, businesses, organizations, and government agencies consider internships a prerequisite experience to full-time employment. In fact, on college campuses across this country, career service officers push their students to obtain competitive internships because they provide valuable professional experiences and are considered essential. What we often forget is that unpaid interns are amongst the most vulnerable of workers. They need these internships to succeed in their careers. Yet, they are powerless to protect themselves from discrimination and sexual harassment. Facing these challenges can be devastating to young interns at the beginning of their careers. One year ago, a brave and intelligent young woman, Christina, came to my district office to talk to me about her experiences as an unpaid intern. Christina had faced sexual harassment. She had no legal recourse, but she refused to stay silent. She came to my office with a fellow college student, Anna. They told me about the experiences of many young college students who had faced sexual harassment as unpaid interns. I stand here on their behalf today because we can do something about this. State legislatures across this country have started to listen. New York, Oregon, Illinois, California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and New York City have all passed some form of protection for unpaid interns. Unpaid internships in Federal agencies, in particular, are coveted and competitive positions. The Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015 directly addresses this vulnerability by extending existing Federal protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to unpaid interns working for the Federal Government. We can provide vulnerable interns in the Federal Government with the protections they deserve. I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Cummings, for his leadership on this issue. I also thank Representative Scott of Virginia and Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton and their staff for all of their hard work. Mr. CHAFFETZ. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume as I close. Madam Speaker, there have been several cases where interns have tried to bring suit and the courts have said that you have no remedy. Chairman Chaffetz is absolutely right. It is sad when you can have such an egregious act but no remedy. I think one of the most frustrating things for anyone is when they have been harmed or when they have been treated wrongfully and there is no remedy, there is a problem. The courts have said over and over again: Congress, if you want there to be a remedy, then you have to act. That is exactly what we are doing today. I think it says a lot for us as a Congress, and I think it says a lot for us as a Nation. Going back to some of the words of Chairman Chaffetz, when we look at unpaid interns, they do come to these offices trying to get experience and trying to learn the duties and the responsibilities of a certain job. They realize that by doing this, it may very well change in a positive way the trajectory of their destiny. They come in with those high expectations, only to have them destroyed.

They realize that by doing this, it may very well change in a positive way the trajectory of their destiny. They come in with those high expectations, only to have them destroyed. Sometimes the damage can last not for a day or for a week, but for a lifetime. Then there is another piece that I think a lot of people don't think about, and that is that it is not always the deed, but it is also the memory of having gone through these types of incidents. I think this is a very important piece of legislation. I would urge my colleagues to vote for it. Again, I thank the chairman, because we sat there in a hearing and we heard about a very bad case. A lot of people wonder about the value of hearings [[Page H257]] sometimes, but out of that hearing came this legislation. So, again, I thank the chairman for all of his hard work in helping us get the bill to the floor. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the kind words, and I appreciate the dedication and commitment of Mr. Cummings, Mr. Scott of Virginia, and others who care deeply about this. I do as well. To be able to play a role to help shepherd it to this point is an honor and a privilege. I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3231, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_238.csv,17627,17627,17695,"[congressional record volume 162, number 6 (monday, january 11, 2016)] [house] [pages h255-h257] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] federal intern protection act of 2015 mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 3231) to amend title 5, united states code, to protect unpaid interns in the federal government from workplace harassment and discrimination, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 3231 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``federal intern protection act of 2015''. sec. 2. prohibited personnel practices. (a) in general.--section 2302 of title 5, united states code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(g)(1) all protections afforded to an employee under subparagraphs (a), (b), and (d) of subsection (b)(1) shall be afforded, in the same manner and to the same extent, to an intern and an applicant for internship. ``(2) for purposes of the application of this subsection, a reference to an employee shall be considered a reference to an intern in-- ``(a) section 717 of the civil rights act of 1964 (42 u.s.c. 2000e-16); ``(b) sections 12 and 15 of the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 (29 u.s.c. 631, 633a); and ``(c) section 501 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 (29 u.s.c. 791). ``(3) in this subsection, the term `intern' means an individual who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution or to learn a trade or occupation.''. (b) conforming amendment.--section 3111(c)(1) of title 5, united states code, is amended by inserting ``section 2302(g) (relating to prohibited personnel practices),'' before ``chapter 81''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) and the gentleman from maryland (mr. cummings) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from utah. general leave mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from utah? there was no objection. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise today in support of h.r. 3231, the federal intern protection act of 2015, as introduced by the ranking member, mr. cummings. this is a bill brought to my attention by him. we took it through the process in our committee and marked it up, and here we are on the floor. the bill establishes some important protections against the workplace discrimination and harassment of both unpaid federal interns and applicants for federal internships. currently, there are no specific provisions in law to protect these unpaid interns. h.r. 3231 makes it illegal to discriminate, to sexually harass, or to retaliate against unpaid federal interns and applicants for federal internships. specifically, the bill protects against discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin under the civil rights act of 1967, under the age discrimination in employment act of 1967, and under the handicapping condition under the rehabilitation act of 1973. unpaid interns, similar to paid employees, are to be considered protected against discrimination and harassment. i thank mr. cummings for his passion on this issue to guard against this discrimination and harassment. i look forward to supporting this bill. i am glad we could bring it to the floor today. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. cummings. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the bill before us, the federal intern protection act, would close a loophole in federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns open to discrimination and sexual harassment. earlier this year our committee held a hearing at which we heard testimony about sexual harassment and retaliation in an epa regional office. during that hearing, both chairman chaffetz and i expressed our disgust at the exploitation of these young women and demanded that action be taken to prevent this in the future. unfortunately, the act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of race, religion, age, or, in this case, sex is not prohibited by federal law. under current law, victims rely on the discretion of managers to prevent the recurrence of this behavior, something that does not always occur. as one witness testified: ``even after finding out about the numerous harassment victims, the direct reporting manager continued to feed the harasser a steady diet of young women.'' as we saw at our hearing, allowing this kind of behavior to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of those who are interested in government service and on those who are simply trying to be all that god meant for them to be. there are many unpaid interns who are willing to commit to working for the federal government. we should protect them from this kind of despicable behavior. i want to take a moment to thank chairman chaffetz for helping us to move this bill through the committee expeditiously and to bring it to the floor. as a matter of fact, in our committee, we received a unanimous vote on it, and i am hoping that there will be a unanimous vote on the floor today. i thank him and i thank his staff and our staff for pulling all of this together to get us to this moment. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i have no additional speakers. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. cummings. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. scott). mr. scott of virginia. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3231, the federal intern protection act. this bill would amend title 5 of the u.s. code to extend protections against discrimination and harassment to unpaid interns who work at federal agencies. the bill would define an intern as someone who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution or to learn a trade or occupation. internships are often the first real entry into a profession; yet, unpaid interns are not expressly protected from the discriminatory practices prohibited by the civil rights act of 1964, the age discrimination in employment act, the rehabilitation act, and other laws and regulations. this bill would remedy this problem and extend those workplace protections to unpaid interns who may be vulnerable to egregious treatment. madam speaker, all too often, when unpaid interns have taken cases of workplace discrimination to the courts, the courts have ruled against them. in the second circuit, a unanimous panel of judges concluded that unpaid interns are not employees covered by existing laws. in the 1997 case of o'connor v. davis, an employee at a state hospital harassed an unpaid intern, calling her miss sexual harassment and subjecting her to sexually explicit comments. the court stated that it was not unsympathetic to o'connor's situation and acknowledged that she was not in quite the same position to simply walk away from the alleged harassment, as her success at school was dependent on her successfully completing her internship. the second circuit noted that ms. o'connor's dependency on her employer made her vulnerable to continued harassment much as an employee dependent on a regular wage can be vulnerable to ongoing misconduct. despite that, the second circuit concluded: ``it is for congress, if it should choose to do so, and not this court to provide a remedy under either title vii or title ix for plaintiffs in o'connor's position.'' as ranking member of the house committee on education and the workforce, i urge congress to do more to protect unpaid interns, be it in the federal sector, in the halls of congress, or in the private sector. the house committee on education and the workforce has jurisdiction [[page h256]] over legislation that strengthens worker protections and defends the civil rights laws of workers, including fighting against discrimination and supporting diversity in the workplace. now that the house is about to complete the consideration of h.r. 3231, covering federal workers, i am calling on the leadership of the committee on education and the workforce to move expeditiously to consider the companion legislation, h.r. 3232, the unpaid intern protection act. that bill would ensure that unpaid interns in the private sector are free from discrimination and harassment as prohibited by the civil rights act. {time} 1745 extending workplace protections to nonpaid interns, who under current law lack the protections provided by civil rights laws, should be a priority for the committee on education and the workforce, and that is because internships have become such an important part of the workforce. according to the 2014 state of internships report from a college intern database, internmatch, about two-thirds of interns surveyed said internships were important for long-term career advancement and about the same number even stated that internships should be mandatory. student surveys showed that over 60 percent want to intern in the private sector, about 14 percent in the government sector, and 19 percent in nonprofit organizations. as members of congress, our position should be clear. regardless of whether an internship is at a federal agency, on capitol hill, or at a fortune 500 company, we must ensure that the unpaid status of interns does not leave them without a remedy when their civil rights are violated. to that end, we should begin by passing h.r. 3231, the federal intern protection act. we should then start working on legislation to provide similar protections to unpaid interns who work in the private sector. i want to thank ranking member cummings for his leadership on this bill, along with my fellow cosponsors, the gentlewoman from new york (ms. meng) and the delegate from washington, d.c. (ms. norton). i urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill. mr. chaffetz. madam speaker, there are some good young people who are getting their education. they are excited. they have their whole life in front of them. they get this amazing opportunity to do this internship. maybe it is a month, maybe it is 3 months, maybe it is 6 months. it is just a limited portion of time. that is where they are going to get a base of knowledge and experience that they are going to be able then to parlay and take into the workforce. it is going to help shape and mold their futures. as members, every one of us rely on interns. we have them in our offices in our districts and we have them in our offices in washington, d.c. we see them in the private sector. we see them all over the place. they provide a valuable role. unfortunately, there are some young people--and we have heard these stories, and they are horrific--who go into this situation, and somebody in power, somebody who does get a paycheck, somebody who does control their time, does ask them to do tasks--does the unforgivable and asks them--or does something to them that they should never do. to hear this story that there isn't a law on the books so the courts can help take care of it, that is just not an excuse. we do a lot of things in this body, and i would like to think this is one of the really good things that we do here today, is pass a piece of legislation like this so we can protect these young people, because if somebody does break the law and does go forward and does do something unforgivable, they have some recourse. if we are going to take their time and we are going to use the resources of these young people, those people in charge should be held accountable. i think that is the good we are doing here today. so to those particularly young women--i am sure there are young men out there too, i just haven't heard as many of their stories--to those young women, at least, i hope we are listening and we are doing something good. that is why i encourage the passage of this bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. cummings. madam speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york (ms. meng), one of the cosponsors of this bill. ms. meng. madam speaker, i rise today to express strong support for h.r. 3231, the federal intern protection act of 2015. madam speaker, internships are increasingly considered a resume necessity for entry-level positions in both the public and private sector. more and more, businesses, organizations, and government agencies consider internships a prerequisite experience to full-time employment. in fact, on college campuses across this country, career service officers push their students to obtain competitive internships because they provide valuable professional experiences and are considered essential. what we often forget is that unpaid interns are amongst the most vulnerable of workers. they need these internships to succeed in their careers. yet, they are powerless to protect themselves from discrimination and sexual harassment. facing these challenges can be devastating to young interns at the beginning of their careers. one year ago, a brave and intelligent young woman, christina, came to my district office to talk to me about her experiences as an unpaid intern. christina had faced sexual harassment. she had no legal recourse, but she refused to stay silent. she came to my office with a fellow college student, anna. they told me about the experiences of many young college students who had faced sexual harassment as unpaid interns. i stand here on their behalf today because we can do something about this. state legislatures across this country have started to listen. new york, oregon, illinois, california, connecticut, new jersey, washington, d.c., and new york city have all passed some form of protection for unpaid interns. unpaid internships in federal agencies, in particular, are coveted and competitive positions. the federal intern protection act of 2015 directly addresses this vulnerability by extending existing federal protections under the civil rights act of 1964 to unpaid interns working for the federal government. we can provide vulnerable interns in the federal government with the protections they deserve. i would like to thank my colleague, representative cummings, for his leadership on this issue. i also thank representative scott of virginia and ms. eleanor holmes norton and their staff for all of their hard work. mr. chaffetz. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. cummings. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume as i close. madam speaker, there have been several cases where interns have tried to bring suit and the courts have said that you have no remedy. chairman chaffetz is absolutely right. it is sad when you can have such an egregious act but no remedy. i think one of the most frustrating things for anyone is when they have been harmed or when they have been treated wrongfully and there is no remedy, there is a problem. the courts have said over and over again: congress, if you want there to be a remedy, then you have to act. that is exactly what we are doing today. i think it says a lot for us as a congress, and i think it says a lot for us as a nation. going back to some of the words of chairman chaffetz, when we look at unpaid interns, they do come to these offices trying to get experience and trying to learn the duties and the responsibilities of a certain job. they realize that by doing this, it may very well change in a positive way the trajectory of their destiny. they come in with those high expectations, only to have them destroyed. sometimes the damage can last not for a day or for a week, but for a lifetime.

Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, securing our networks from cyber attack is a challenging task. One of the most effective techniques is penetration testing, or turning hacking tools on one's own network to find weaknesses before bad actors have a chance to exploit them. Unfortunately, a rule proposed by the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce last May has the potential to make it much harder to share existing tools and develop new ones, which could severely harm our national security and our economic competitiveness. The rule was issued as part of the addition of ``intrusion software'' to the Wassenaar Arrangement, one of the principal international export control regimes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, using a 20-year-old framework--itself the successor of a three-quarter-century-old cold war agreement--to regulate cutting-edge technology has proved difficult. However, I am very thankful for the Bureau's willingness to reexamine the initial proposal, and I am looking forward to tomorrow's Homeland Security hearing as an important step in the process to produce a final rule that allows defenders to test their networks before they are attacked. This is a bipartisan hearing tomorrow, and I look forward to tomorrow's hearing. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Page H259] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRUSION SOFTWARE AND THE WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important contribution women pilots have made to the service of our military in World War II. These women deserve a proper military resting place. In 1942, Betty Grace Clements of Elmwood, Nebraska, entered into the Women Airforce Service Pilots. Betty was one of only 1,100 women who had earned her wings to fly noncombat missions to support the war effort. Betty's job during World War II was to provide courier services for then-Colonel Paul Tibbets and his crew. Colonel Tibbets and his crew were training to fly the Enola Gay and bring an end to the war. Betty was part of the history. She helped end the war, and she served Nebraska and her country with honor. Betty passed away in 1965, but, under today's law, her ashes could not be added to the Arlington National Cemetery. I think that is a shame. WASPs have fought for proper recognition for their service. I applaud Congresswoman McSally for her bill to give these women the recognition they deserve. I thank Dr. Grace Clements, Congresswoman McSally, and all women pilots who have served. I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Page H259] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING WOMEN PILOTS (Mr. ASHFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

The shooter complained of hearing voices. More gun control will not stop terrorists. The attacker shouted his support for ISIS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about a very special group of women who were mentors to me and who were pioneering heroes of our country. These women were the Women Airforce Service Pilots, the WASPs. Some people don't know that much about them, but here is a picture of them as they flew airplanes in the World War II era. When we needed everybody to serve in whatever capacity one could in our country, they needed women to step up and become pilots in order to do all sorts of different missions, like towing targets for the gunners on the ground to learn how to shoot things down, like training men to go on to fly in combat, like ferrying airplanes all over the theaters to deliver them where they needed to be in the combat zone and bringing them back for maintenance. They were test pilots and engineers. You name it. These women were asked to step up and serve. They went through training. They put on the uniform. They lived in the barracks. They learned how to march. They were pioneers for women like me, who later on served as aviators in the military. There are just a little over 1,000 of these amazing women who served in World War II. They weren't given Active-Duty status, although that was the intent of General Arnold when they set up this program. If you think back then, the thought of having women military pilots was a little bit of a cultural hang-up. We will let women be Rosie the Riveter, and we will let women serve in support positions. But pilots? Now, that is kind of crazy talk. So they had a little bit of a problem culturally, but they didn't care. They chose to serve anyway. They said, ``I am going to step up and serve my country. I am going to do that as a pilot. I am going to do this with honor and with valor,'' just like their male counterparts did in these very same missions before them, alongside them, and then after them. Thirty-eight of them died in training or in conducting missions. Thirty-eight of them paid the ultimate sacrifice. They weren't even given veterans' benefits or any benefits after perishing in the line of duty, but they still continued to serve because their country needed them. It was not until 1977 that they were actually given veteran status after the fact. They were then given honorable discharges. They were given the medals that their male counterparts got for serving as Active Duty in the military. They were allowed to be buried, with honors, in veterans' cemeteries across the country and were given full military honors, which they deserved. They were actually allowed, as they should be allowed, to be in Arlington National Cemetery, alongside other heroes who have gone before them. Yet, we just found out within the last few weeks that that has been rescinded by the Department of Army. That happened quietly back in March of 2015 to these heroes, who deserve to be recognized and who deserve to be a legacy in Arlington National Cemetery so that future generations will know what they did and will know of the doors that they opened in the way that they served. It was rescinded by the Army. We didn't know about this until Elaine Harmon, one of the WASPs, passed away. I saw her handwritten will when I me with her family last week. It reads, ``I desire to be in Arlington National Cemetery. I want my ashes there.'' Her family put in the request like everybody else does, and they were denied. We now found out that the Army has rescinded that and that it is no longer allowing these pioneering women to be laid to rest in Arlington. Elaine Harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet in her granddaughter's home, awaiting her final resting place in Arlington, which she deserves. The Army gave us some bureaucratic answer about, oh, they are running out of space, and, by mistake, they opened it up. In 2002, they actually allowed women to be in Arlington. Only two women took advantage of this and asked to be, in their own right, in Arlington. Then the Army turned around and rescinded it. Again, they gave some bureaucratic answer. They are on the wrong side of this. We have looked into all of the legalities. The Army has all of the authorities that they need to allow these heroes to be laid to rest in Arlington, but they are choosing not to do so. We have introduced legislation. We are going to make sure that it happens, but we are calling on them to actually [[Page H261]] change it tonight. Right now, the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of Defense or the President could tonight say: Do you know what? Elaine Harmon and the other WASPs--there are only a little over 100 who are still living--are going to be allowed to have their ashes in Arlington National Cemetery alongside other heroes. This is the least they could do, and they could do it tonight. So I am leading the Special Order tonight. This is a bipartisan Special Order. This is bipartisan legislation, and it is bicameral. When we raised awareness of this issue and got the legislation together, we had nearly 80 sponsors right away on this bill who said: Let's change this thing. Today the Senate introduced a similar bill, and we are going to work together to get this thing done. We want to continue to raise awareness to this issue, this egregious violation of these women. We want this thing changed now. It takes a little bit of time sometimes around here to work through legislation. In the meantime, Elaine Harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet. That is not the way we treat our heroes. That is not the way we treat our pioneers who paved the way for military aviators, like me, to be able to serve in the way we did, and it needs to be changed tonight. We have a number of individuals here on both sides of the aisle who are going to be sharing this time with me tonight. I first yield to my good friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), who is the lead Democratic cosponsor of this bill. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Thank you so much. I am so glad that my colleague from Arizona is here to speak to this. She is very uniquely qualified to do that as one of the first women pilots--or the first--to actually fly in combat. As I remember, the women who joined us a few years ago here in the Capitol who were part of the WASPs were here to receive Gold Medals for their heroic acts during the war and for really coming forward and being part of that volunteer band of women who had had some experience in flying, but who could not have imagined in their wildest dreams doing what they were asked to do, but they were delighted to do it. As I will share, they actually wanted to do more, but there were some other people who took over and asked them to go home and enjoy their lives after they had given so much. So I am just delighted to join in this effort and to right this injustice for military trailblazers who were truly ahead of their time. When the call came to serve in World War II, the WASPs answered that call just like millions of other Americans. They logged over 60 million miles in over 12,000 aircraft. As my colleague has said, 38 WASP women died while serving their country. In 2009, as I mentioned, the WASPs were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for flying military missions in World War II. Boy, even when they were here, they were just a strong group of women who delighted in seeing one another and in reminding themselves of the amazing stories that they brought. More than anything else, they serve today as great role models to women who were considering going in the Air Force, of course, and in the Navy, flying for our country, but, also, for taking on some remarkable challenges in their lives. They really represent that for all of us. They fought, of course, and they died in service to their country. They trained in military style. They slept on metal cots like everybody else and marched and lived under military discipline. That is why we feel they deserve the full honors that we give our war heroes. As has been mentioned, they were given those honors, but because we have a problem of space, it was decided that perhaps they were not at the top of the list. We need to be sure that we provide for everyone who needs to be there. There are many WASPs who may not necessarily choose to be at Arlington National Cemetery, but for those who have chosen in working with their families--and their families have fought hard for them--this is something that we need to do. I want to particularly mention--and I thought this was really fun to read--one of the articles about these WASPs. This is Eddy, who is saying, ``I thought it was the nastiest thing that they''--speaking of the Army Air Forces officials--``could have done to us.'' This was while she was receiving visitors at her home in Coronado. ``They fired us. They gave our jobs to Air Force men who didn't want to go overseas. I would have gone overseas in a minute,'' she said. ``I was a (heck of) a good fighter pilot.'' In my community of San Diego, in El Cajon, I also have a woman named Joyce Secciani, who perhaps was not as forthright as Eddy. But despite some fading memories, at 87, she still shares Vivian's passion for the WASPs and her disappointment with its demise. She was also one of the 1,102 women who flew in the all-volunteer program between 1942 and 1944. She remarked, ``All of us felt bad to lose (our flying jobs)--all of us wanted to keep up our ability to fly,'' because they knew that, with prevailing chauvinistic attitudes, there would be no pilots' work for them in the civilian realm. We need to be sure that we don't lose our perspective about the work that these women did and that we honor them in this way, that we honor them and their families who supported them as well, because we know, with all of our military families, it is not just the person who serves, but it is the entire family who serves as well. That was certainly true of these WASPs, whose family members worried about them and were concerned about them as they carried on with their duties as forcibly as they did. Let's send that message. Let's continue to work hard. I know that the WASPs are also planning a museum to honor them and to make sure that the country never forgets the work that they did because it was necessary. Had they not been there to do that work, many, many people would not have received the materials. Whatever it was, they were making sure that it got to our fighting warriors during World War II. {time} 1930 I am so delighted that my colleague is choosing to move forward with this. I want to turn it back to her, and I know that there are other colleagues of mine over here that would like very much to join in this. Ms. McSALLY. Thank you, Congresswoman Davis. I really appreciate your partnership on this issue. Together we can show the American people that we can be united on these things that matter to support our veterans and support our heroes and, again, put the pressure on the administration that we have oversight of to actually fix this wrong right now. I really look forward to continuing working with you on it. I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who is joining this discussion as a cosponsor on the bill, very strongly supporting this initiative. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman. I don't think it much matters if you are a man or you are a woman, but you serve in the United States military. Anybody who has stood up for this country to protect our freedom, protect our way of life, protect our kids, they should receive the full benefits, the full honors of anybody who served in uniform. Now, tonight, as Congresswoman McSally said, we can fix this. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why the Pentagon should, for some reason, say there is no room at Arlington. Are you kidding me? Over 1,000 of these brave, patriotic women, during a time where, as Congresswoman McSally and Congresswoman Davis mentioned, they were not always welcomed in doing what men were doing, they stood up, they stood up and they left their homes and they left their families. They did what was right. They served this country with honor, with dignity. They flew 78 different types of aircraft all over the world. Over 60 million miles were logged. Look at this picture. I salute you, Congresswoman, for bringing this before us. Now, do you think any of these WASPs were saying, ``Well, I don't know, we just can't get this done, we just can't perform this mission, I am sorry''? Well, the Pentagon needs to step up right now. They need to find a [[Page H262]] way to make sure, if these WASPs want to be interred at Arlington, they should be. Now, some of the missions that these brave women flew on included transporting these vehicles all around the world. You know what they also did? They towed targets for men on the ground that were practicing artillery. Did you hear one of these WASPs complain, ``Gee, I hope that these men will hit the targets instead of us''? The least the Pentagon can do is to take this seriously, listen to the will of the people, and make sure that these brave women are so honored by being interred, if they wish, at Arlington. Now, one of these humble American heroes is a woman by the name of Betty Anne Brown, who very recently passed away at age 92. Now, wouldn't she be proud of all of us today standing up and asking that our country, that the Pentagon does the right thing? I salute Ms. McSally for her leadership on this issue. The Pentagon can do what is right today. As you mentioned, Congresswoman, legislation is not needed if our Commander in Chief or the folks who run the Pentagon stand up and do what is right. These women deserve every right to be buried at Arlington if they so wish. Thank you very much, and I am honored to cosponsor this bill. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Poliquin. I really appreciate his strong support and strong words in support of this effort here. I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my good friend. I think back to how many years ago it was this week, actually, when I was your guest at the State of the Union Address. So I have appreciated your support to me when I was in the military and the fights that we had to make sure that women were treated fairly and, also, your strong support on this particular effort. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman McSally for yielding. I want to thank her for bringing our attention to this important issue this evening. I am proud to serve with her on the House Armed Services Committee. I know she is very proud to represent the people of Arizona in the Second Congressional District there. I might make note that Ms. McSally's roots are from my home State of Rhode Island. She and I grew up in the same neighborhood, and I am proud to have worked with her on several issues since she has arrived in Congress. I was proud, again, back then to have her as my guest to the State of the Union Message as she mentioned. Again, I thank you for raising this important issue. I find it completely disheartening that the Women Airforce Service Pilots have been denied interment in one of our Nation's most sacred national burial grounds where we honor our men and women who have served. These brave female aviators of World War II embody courage, resiliency, and patriotism. Again, I am proud to support Congresswoman McSally's efforts to reinstate their interment eligibility in Arlington National Cemetery. Without these women, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in one of its greatest times of need, our Nation would not stand where it does in the world today. We are indebted to them for their service. The very least that we can do, Mr. Speaker, is to honor them with the dignity and the respect that they have earned and so deserve. We have got to see this policy reversed. I know that we will. It is a bipartisan effort. I am proud to join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in raising attention to this issue and insisting that we ensure that these brave female aviators of World War II, again, who embody the courage and resiliency and patriotism that this country so admires and that we are grateful for, and that we see that they are properly given the honor that they deserve. Again, I want to thank Congresswoman McSally for shedding this light on this misguided injustice. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Langevin. Again, I appreciate your support on this bill and your friendship over the years. I look forward to working together to getting this mission done and then additional things in the future. Thank you so much for your strong support for our heroes. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). She has been a strong advocate, as others who have spoken today, for the WASPs and especially the push for the Congressional Gold Medal. I am just honored to have you as a cosponsor and a strong advocate on this bill. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I am so pleased, so honored, so humbled to be part of your Special Order. In the short time that you have been in Congress, you have been a real leader on so many important issues, and I think none as important as the one that you are spearheading today. I rise today to support you in your mission to give due recognition to the Women Airforce Service Pilots, otherwise known as WASPs, not the other WASPs that you know about. These are the real ladies that got the job done. They are a remarkable group of women who served our country proudly during World War II. As you heard from the other speakers, our country turned to female pilots to deliver planes to our military air bases overseas, tow targets for live antiaircraft artillery practice, and simulate strafing missions. They became the first women in U.S. history to fly for our proud military. Out of more than 25,000 women who applied for the program, only 1,704 were accepted in noncombat roles. These courageous American women logged in more than 60 million miles between 1942 and 1944, but it wasn't until 1977 that Congress passed legislation that gave these patriotic women their much-deserved veteran recognition. In 2002, Arlington National Cemetery decided to allow WASPs, among others listed as Active Duty designees, to receive benefits consistent with the status that they had so rightfully earned. However, the Department of the Army recently rescinded this decision and made these brave women aviators of World War II ineligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. As the author of the legislation--and the gentlewoman and I have talked about this repeatedly--awarding WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal in the year of 2009, I am honored to stand with my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Martha McSally, a true patriot in her own right, to ensure that the WASPs have the right to have these services alongside the rest of our war heroes. These patriotic women selflessly helped defend our country. They deserve full military honor. I am humbled and proud to represent south Florida, and I would like to inform the gentlewoman that this has been home to some of these remarkable heroine women. I am going to mention some of their names: Frances Rohrer Sargent, Helen Wyatt Snapp, Ruth Schafer Fleisher, Shirley Kruse, and Bee Haydu. Some are with us, and some are no longer with us. Some are not in great shape because they served in World War II. It is happening throughout our Nation where we see our finest passing away. In this time of great challenges to women, those women that you have there before us, they pushed beyond the boundaries. They brought new opportunities for women to come. My daughter-in-law, Lindsay, she flew combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan for the Marines, but she would not have been able to do so without the women who came before her. Just as you are a pioneer--to the gentlewoman I say thank you for your patriotic duty--but you stand also on their shoulders. These pioneers fought for the values of freedom and democracy. It is our duty to ensure that they are not denied the recognition for their service. We shouldn't be begging for this. With the valiant efforts of these American heroines, the United States and our allies were able to successfully defeat the Axis Powers during World War II. I thank you, Congresswoman McSally, for introducing this important legislation that would make the Women Airforce Service Pilots eligible, once again, for the services in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. I agree with you that we don't need the legislation; that tonight, the Secretary of the Army could do the right thing, as he had done before, sign the order making this happen. We will continue the battle in their names. Thank you so much to the gentlewoman. Thank you for spearheading [[Page H263]] this effort. Thank you for taking this on. You are a valuable member of this institution. Thank you for the time. Ms. McSALLY. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida. As soon as I mentioned it to Ileana, she was like: This is wrong. We have got to get involved. We have got to fix this. So I appreciate your strong advocacy before I got here, and your continued advocacy as a wingwoman in this cause. You know, for the WASPs in this story and this cause, it is not just the right thing to do for the country. For me, it is also personal. These women opened the door for me to be able to be a pilot in the Air Force and, when the doors were opened, to transition to be a fighter pilot in the Air Force. I will be honest with you, I didn't hear about them when I was in high school. This is one reason why it is so important that we allow them to be laid to rest in Arlington, so that it is part of the education for future generations. It wasn't until I went off to the Air Force Academy that I actually learned about the WASPs and learned about what they did. I just didn't even imagine that we would have women military pilots in the 1940s in World War II, but we did. I got to meet some of these amazing women when I first came to Tucson to fly the A-10 Warthog, started my training. There were several of them that lived in southern Arizona, and I got to become friends with them, and they became mentors to me and encouragers to me. As the doors were opening up for us to transition into fighters, there was hardly anybody we could really look to who understood what it was like to be in challenging circumstances where you are the only woman. People have attitudes about whether you can or cannot or should or should not do what you are doing as an aviator. But these women understood that. They put up with the same biases and the same discrimination as they served. They flew in World War II. As I was looking around for someone to have as a role model, these women were incredible friends to me and supporters and wingwomen to me. Here is one picture I want to show you. This is Ruth Helm, one of the Tucson residents who, sadly, made her final flight over the last year. This is when she was inducted into the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame. This is a picture of the two of us in civilian clothes as she was inducted there. {time} 1945 These women paved the way for me, but they encouraged me. Even at my most challenging times, when I was feeling discouraged, I would sit down with them, and they would just fire me up to live to fight and fly another day. Despite the fact that they were told to leave the military after all they did, they still were proud. They didn't have a chip on their shoulder. They were grateful for the opportunities that they had. They laughed off some of the challenges that they went through. They just started encouraging me, ``Come on, you can do it. We did it.'' I just was able to kind of get back in there and continue to push forward because of what they did before me to open up the doors for me. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. McSALLY. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Obviously we share a compassion and passion for these wonderful women. We also serve on the Committee on Homeland Security together. First of all, let me thank you for your service and thank you so very much for bringing this very important issue, this bipartisan issue to the floor of the House and certainly to your colleagues. I am looking forward to working with you on this issue. I just want to say that one of my greatest joys in the United States Congress was the military war zones that I had the chance to go to, starting with the Bosnian war. I came in in that timeframe and traveled to that area, Kosovo and Albania, and then, of course, Iraq and Afghanistan and certainly a number of other sites where issues of conflict were going on. There I saw a myriad of women who stood on the shoulders of these women, who are now in a variety of the branches, not just aviators or in the Air Force in particular, but they stood on the shoulders of these women. It gave me a sense of pride and duty to say to them, ``Thank you.'' Women are unique. Many of them are mothers or sisters and daughters who are in the service, or they take care of children, or they are nurturers for someone else. We have a particular role, but yet they are in the military leaving their families. Just coming in today, I read an article about the ranger who is from my constituency who just came out of ranger school and is from Houston. I simply want to say, this is the right thing to do. Every year--and I think you have joined us now as you have come to Congress--we go on Memorial Day week to Arlington and lay a wreath for women who died in the line of duty or in the service of their country. Does anyone realize the numbers of women? We have been doing this now for more than a decade, and the women of the House join us. They do that because this is a valuable part of America's history. To the lady, the aviator that now, I wouldn't say languished, but is with her granddaughter, her ashes are with her granddaughter, I want to make a public commitment joining you to say that her ashes should be in a place where she can rest in peace. We should move this quickly. If it requires an independent action by the Army, a reconsideration, I am sure none of us would be offended by the Army rescinding this particular--how should I say it?--action. I just wanted to come and thank you. I want to thank my colleague Susan Davis and all of my colleagues who have been on the floor. I did not want to miss this opportunity. Coming from Texas, I think, as I walk down the streets of Houston or travel throughout the State of Texas, I see veterans and Active Duty everywhere. We are proud of that. In urban centers like Houston, you would think not, but they are dominant there. Just this past Christmas, we had what we call Toys for Kids and honored veterans' families. This is an important mission, and I want to join you in this mission. We have gotten our assignment. We really need to work. I think the American people need to know that all of us will join together to honor either our veterans, our fallen soldiers, or those who were the pioneers who I know the story of, who stood when they were called and did not step away from duty, did not step away from the danger, did not step away from possible death as they pursued the cause of this country and to protect this country. I thank you for yielding to me. I am ready to roll up my sleeves. Let's get busy. Let's help find a resting place for this dear sister and servant of the Nation. Let's find a resting place going forward for all of those who have served this wonderful and great country. They deserve it. Ms. McSALLY. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for joining the conversation tonight, again, to continue to highlight this egregious action that was taken that is putting our heroes in a place, especially Elaine Harmon, right now, where she has nowhere to be able to rest in peace. The place that she wanted to be is denying her, even though her service and the criteria are very clear that she has earned that right. I really appreciate you joining this bipartisan mission. We are not going to rest until the mission is complete. I want to thank the gentlewoman for that. As I was mentioning, this isn't just the right thing to do, but this is personal for me. As I transitioned into fighters, these women, these pioneers who opened up the door for me to even have the opportunity to become a fighter pilot, they mentored me. They walked alongside me. They encouraged me. They gave me some perspectives from their own training and their own experiences. They made me laugh. They made me cry. They were friends who just paved the way for me. You think about the debates we have had in this body over the years. I mean, women couldn't be pilots again in the military until, the late 1970s or early 1980s, they finally opened up the door for women to be pilots. But they could only serve in noncombat roles. [[Page H264]] When they had that debate, that didn't have to be theoretical or hypothetical. They had the example of these amazing women who did what they did in World War II--again, over a thousand of them, under extraordinary circumstances, flying by themselves, often just trying to figure it out in bad weather and how they were going to land and dealing with emergencies and clearances and just doing what it took in order to get the mission done, get the plane where it needed to be, train the men to go off and fly in combat, tow the targets, do the simulated strafing runs, all the test piloting, everything, to include risking their lives. Thirty-eight of them died. This is personal to me. These three women pictured in this photo-- Dawn Seymour, Eleanor Gunderson, and Ruth Helm--they are sitting in this photo in the front row of the change of command ceremony that I had where I took over command of an A-10 fighter squadron, which was an historic day for our country that we finally had a woman doing that. It was an historic day for me to be able to take command of a squadron. I invited them and asked them to sit in the front row. I honored them in my change of command speech because I wanted to make sure that everybody there knew that I only had the opportunities that I had in the military because they paved the way. These three women are personal friends of mine. Two of them have since had their final flight. Dawn Seymour is still with us, but the other two have passed away. We have to keep their legacy going. We have to make sure the next generations know how they served with honor at a time when the country needed them. We have to make sure that Elaine Harmon and any of the other WASPs who want to have their ashes in Arlington Cemetery are allowed to do that. Let's be clear. The only reason these women were not considered Active Duty at the time was because of gender biases and discrimination against women. That is the only reason. Had they been a man doing those jobs, they would have been Active Duty in the Army Air Corps; they would have been discharged honorably; and under the current guidelines, they would have been eligible to have their ashes at Arlington. The only reason they were not Active Duty at the time was because of gender discrimination. Now this is 2016. It is time for that to stop. We thought it was over in 1977 when we finally retroactively gave them that veteran status. They were given those honorable discharges and the medals that they deserved from serving in World War II. We opened up the door for them to have military honors and to be laid to rest in veteran cemeteries around the country. Arlington Cemetery opened up the doors to them finally--a little late, but in 2002. Last March, without telling anybody, they quietly rescinded that. It was just the last slap of gender discrimination against these amazing pioneers. It needs to be overturned immediately. This is the right thing to do for Elaine Harmon and for the other women who are still living. There are about 100 of them who are still with us; and for the next generations who need to know about their service, they deserve to be laid to rest next to the other heroes who are there. The Secretary of the Army has all the authority he needs to let Elaine Harmon's ashes be in Arlington. Let's be clear. This does not take legislation. He has all the authority he needs to make that happen tonight. If he won't do it, the Secretary of Defense can. If he won't do it, then President Obama can. We should not wait another day, Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, before making the decision and calling on Elaine Harmon's family and saying, ``It is approved. Elaine can rest in peace in Arlington National Cemetery,'' which is what she deserved and what she asked for. We should not be lingering another day. As we continue to call on the administration to do the right thing, we are not going to sit by idly. We have got our legislation introduced. We have got almost 80 cosponsors in the House. We have got a Senate version of the bill that was introduced today, led by Senator Mikulski and Senator Ernst, also a bipartisan bill. We are going to continue to push this forward to make this right for our heroes, these Women Airforce Service Pilots, these WASPs. It is the least that we could do for all they have done for us. The last thing I want to say before I close out is that this just seems to be a cruel irony and a cruel contradiction if you think about it. Just last month, the Pentagon announced that they are opening up, finally, all positions in the military to women. It has been a long road to get to that place. I have been a strong advocate for that happening for a very long time. We are a country that is about equal opportunity. We are a country that treats people as individuals. Our foundations are based on not treating people as a class. We should always, and in the military as well, pick the best man for the job, even if it is a woman. It has been a long haul to get over our biases as a country about what we think women as a whole group could or should do in service to our military. Gradually, positions have been opened. Gradually, women have continued to show that, when called, they will serve valiantly and with honor. They will fight and they will die, if needed, for our freedoms and our liberty. At the time that the Pentagon is opening up all positions to women in the military that they are qualified for, they are closing the doors to Arlington for the pioneers who made that happen. That is a cruel hypocrisy and contradiction, and it needs to be made right tonight. So again, I call on the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of Defense, and the President--perhaps he could announce it in his speech tomorrow night--that one of the legacy things that we are going to do for our heroes, for our pioneers, for these amazing women, is to allow them to be laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. We owe it to them. They paved the way as trailblazers. We owe it to them to be able to rest alongside the other heroes and to be able to continue to educate the next generations about their legacy. All I will say to the WASPs is: I have got your back. You had mine, and I have got yours now. It is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H260-H264] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WOMEN AIRFORCE SERVICE PILOTS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about a very special group of women who were mentors to me and who were pioneering heroes of our country. These women were the Women Airforce Service Pilots, the WASPs. Some people don't know that much about them, but here is a picture of them as they flew airplanes in the World War II era. When we needed everybody to serve in whatever capacity one could in our country, they needed women to step up and become pilots in order to do all sorts of different missions, like towing targets for the gunners on the ground to learn how to shoot things down, like training men to go on to fly in combat, like ferrying airplanes all over the theaters to deliver them where they needed to be in the combat zone and bringing them back for maintenance. They were test pilots and engineers. You name it. These women were asked to step up and serve. They went through training. They put on the uniform. They lived in the barracks. They learned how to march. They were pioneers for women like me, who later on served as aviators in the military. There are just a little over 1,000 of these amazing women who served in World War II. They weren't given Active-Duty status, although that was the intent of General Arnold when they set up this program. If you think back then, the thought of having women military pilots was a little bit of a cultural hang-up. We will let women be Rosie the Riveter, and we will let women serve in support positions. But pilots? Now, that is kind of crazy talk. So they had a little bit of a problem culturally, but they didn't care. They chose to serve anyway. They said, ``I am going to step up and serve my country. I am going to do that as a pilot. I am going to do this with honor and with valor,'' just like their male counterparts did in these very same missions before them, alongside them, and then after them. Thirty-eight of them died in training or in conducting missions. Thirty-eight of them paid the ultimate sacrifice. They weren't even given veterans' benefits or any benefits after perishing in the line of duty, but they still continued to serve because their country needed them. It was not until 1977 that they were actually given veteran status after the fact. They were then given honorable discharges. They were given the medals that their male counterparts got for serving as Active Duty in the military. They were allowed to be buried, with honors, in veterans' cemeteries across the country and were given full military honors, which they deserved. They were actually allowed, as they should be allowed, to be in Arlington National Cemetery, alongside other heroes who have gone before them. Yet, we just found out within the last few weeks that that has been rescinded by the Department of Army. That happened quietly back in March of 2015 to these heroes, who deserve to be recognized and who deserve to be a legacy in Arlington National Cemetery so that future generations will know what they did and will know of the doors that they opened in the way that they served. It was rescinded by the Army. We didn't know about this until Elaine Harmon, one of the WASPs, passed away. I saw her handwritten will when I me with her family last week. It reads, ``I desire to be in Arlington National Cemetery. I want my ashes there.'' Her family put in the request like everybody else does, and they were denied. We now found out that the Army has rescinded that and that it is no longer allowing these pioneering women to be laid to rest in Arlington. Elaine Harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet in her granddaughter's home, awaiting her final resting place in Arlington, which she deserves. The Army gave us some bureaucratic answer about, oh, they are running out of space, and, by mistake, they opened it up. In 2002, they actually allowed women to be in Arlington. Only two women took advantage of this and asked to be, in their own right, in Arlington. Then the Army turned around and rescinded it. Again, they gave some bureaucratic answer. They are on the wrong side of this. We have looked into all of the legalities. The Army has all of the authorities that they need to allow these heroes to be laid to rest in Arlington, but they are choosing not to do so. We have introduced legislation. We are going to make sure that it happens, but we are calling on them to actually [[Page H261]] change it tonight. Right now, the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of Defense or the President could tonight say: Do you know what? Elaine Harmon and the other WASPs--there are only a little over 100 who are still living--are going to be allowed to have their ashes in Arlington National Cemetery alongside other heroes. This is the least they could do, and they could do it tonight. So I am leading the Special Order tonight. This is a bipartisan Special Order. This is bipartisan legislation, and it is bicameral. When we raised awareness of this issue and got the legislation together, we had nearly 80 sponsors right away on this bill who said: Let's change this thing. Today the Senate introduced a similar bill, and we are going to work together to get this thing done. We want to continue to raise awareness to this issue, this egregious violation of these women. We want this thing changed now. It takes a little bit of time sometimes around here to work through legislation. In the meantime, Elaine Harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet. That is not the way we treat our heroes. That is not the way we treat our pioneers who paved the way for military aviators, like me, to be able to serve in the way we did, and it needs to be changed tonight. We have a number of individuals here on both sides of the aisle who are going to be sharing this time with me tonight. I first yield to my good friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), who is the lead Democratic cosponsor of this bill. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Thank you so much. I am so glad that my colleague from Arizona is here to speak to this. She is very uniquely qualified to do that as one of the first women pilots--or the first--to actually fly in combat. As I remember, the women who joined us a few years ago here in the Capitol who were part of the WASPs were here to receive Gold Medals for their heroic acts during the war and for really coming forward and being part of that volunteer band of women who had had some experience in flying, but who could not have imagined in their wildest dreams doing what they were asked to do, but they were delighted to do it. As I will share, they actually wanted to do more, but there were some other people who took over and asked them to go home and enjoy their lives after they had given so much. So I am just delighted to join in this effort and to right this injustice for military trailblazers who were truly ahead of their time. When the call came to serve in World War II, the WASPs answered that call just like millions of other Americans. They logged over 60 million miles in over 12,000 aircraft. As my colleague has said, 38 WASP women died while serving their country. In 2009, as I mentioned, the WASPs were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for flying military missions in World War II. Boy, even when they were here, they were just a strong group of women who delighted in seeing one another and in reminding themselves of the amazing stories that they brought. More than anything else, they serve today as great role models to women who were considering going in the Air Force, of course, and in the Navy, flying for our country, but, also, for taking on some remarkable challenges in their lives. They really represent that for all of us. They fought, of course, and they died in service to their country. They trained in military style. They slept on metal cots like everybody else and marched and lived under military discipline. That is why we feel they deserve the full honors that we give our war heroes. As has been mentioned, they were given those honors, but because we have a problem of space, it was decided that perhaps they were not at the top of the list. We need to be sure that we provide for everyone who needs to be there. There are many WASPs who may not necessarily choose to be at Arlington National Cemetery, but for those who have chosen in working with their families--and their families have fought hard for them--this is something that we need to do. I want to particularly mention--and I thought this was really fun to read--one of the articles about these WASPs. This is Eddy, who is saying, ``I thought it was the nastiest thing that they''--speaking of the Army Air Forces officials--``could have done to us.'' This was while she was receiving visitors at her home in Coronado. ``They fired us. They gave our jobs to Air Force men who didn't want to go overseas. I would have gone overseas in a minute,'' she said. ``I was a (heck of) a good fighter pilot.'' In my community of San Diego, in El Cajon, I also have a woman named Joyce Secciani, who perhaps was not as forthright as Eddy. But despite some fading memories, at 87, she still shares Vivian's passion for the WASPs and her disappointment with its demise. She was also one of the 1,102 women who flew in the all-volunteer program between 1942 and 1944. She remarked, ``All of us felt bad to lose (our flying jobs)--all of us wanted to keep up our ability to fly,'' because they knew that, with prevailing chauvinistic attitudes, there would be no pilots' work for them in the civilian realm. We need to be sure that we don't lose our perspective about the work that these women did and that we honor them in this way, that we honor them and their families who supported them as well, because we know, with all of our military families, it is not just the person who serves, but it is the entire family who serves as well. That was certainly true of these WASPs, whose family members worried about them and were concerned about them as they carried on with their duties as forcibly as they did. Let's send that message. Let's continue to work hard. I know that the WASPs are also planning a museum to honor them and to make sure that the country never forgets the work that they did because it was necessary. Had they not been there to do that work, many, many people would not have received the materials. Whatever it was, they were making sure that it got to our fighting warriors during World War II. {time} 1930 I am so delighted that my colleague is choosing to move forward with this. I want to turn it back to her, and I know that there are other colleagues of mine over here that would like very much to join in this. Ms. McSALLY. Thank you, Congresswoman Davis. I really appreciate your partnership on this issue. Together we can show the American people that we can be united on these things that matter to support our veterans and support our heroes and, again, put the pressure on the administration that we have oversight of to actually fix this wrong right now. I really look forward to continuing working with you on it. I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who is joining this discussion as a cosponsor on the bill, very strongly supporting this initiative. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman. I don't think it much matters if you are a man or you are a woman, but you serve in the United States military. Anybody who has stood up for this country to protect our freedom, protect our way of life, protect our kids, they should receive the full benefits, the full honors of anybody who served in uniform. Now, tonight, as Congresswoman McSally said, we can fix this. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why the Pentagon should, for some reason, say there is no room at Arlington. Are you kidding me? Over 1,000 of these brave, patriotic women, during a time where, as Congresswoman McSally and Congresswoman Davis mentioned, they were not always welcomed in doing what men were doing, they stood up, they stood up and they left their homes and they left their families. They did what was right. They served this country with honor, with dignity. They flew 78 different types of aircraft all over the world. Over 60 million miles were logged. Look at this picture. I salute you, Congresswoman, for bringing this before us. Now, do you think any of these WASPs were saying, ``Well, I don't know, we just can't get this done, we just can't perform this mission, I am sorry''? Well, the Pentagon needs to step up right now. They need to find a [[Page H262]] way to make sure, if these WASPs want to be interred at Arlington, they should be. Now, some of the missions that these brave women flew on included transporting these vehicles all around the world. You know what they also did? They towed targets for men on the ground that were practicing artillery. Did you hear one of these WASPs complain, ``Gee, I hope that these men will hit the targets instead of us''? The least the Pentagon can do is to take this seriously, listen to the will of the people, and make sure that these brave women are so honored by being interred, if they wish, at Arlington. Now, one of these humble American heroes is a woman by the name of Betty Anne Brown, who very recently passed away at age 92. Now, wouldn't she be proud of all of us today standing up and asking that our country, that the Pentagon does the right thing? I salute Ms. McSally for her leadership on this issue. The Pentagon can do what is right today. As you mentioned, Congresswoman, legislation is not needed if our Commander in Chief or the folks who run the Pentagon stand up and do what is right. These women deserve every right to be buried at Arlington if they so wish. Thank you very much, and I am honored to cosponsor this bill. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Poliquin. I really appreciate his strong support and strong words in support of this effort here. I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my good friend. I think back to how many years ago it was this week, actually, when I was your guest at the State of the Union Address. So I have appreciated your support to me when I was in the military and the fights that we had to make sure that women were treated fairly and, also, your strong support on this particular effort. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman McSally for yielding. I want to thank her for bringing our attention to this important issue this evening. I am proud to serve with her on the House Armed Services Committee. I know she is very proud to represent the people of Arizona in the Second Congressional District there. I might make note that Ms. McSally's roots are from my home State of Rhode Island. She and I grew up in the same neighborhood, and I am proud to have worked with her on several issues since she has arrived in Congress. I was proud, again, back then to have her as my guest to the State of the Union Message as she mentioned. Again, I thank you for raising this important issue. I find it completely disheartening that the Women Airforce Service Pilots have been denied interment in one of our Nation's most sacred national burial grounds where we honor our men and women who have served. These brave female aviators of World War II embody courage, resiliency, and patriotism. Again, I am proud to support Congresswoman McSally's efforts to reinstate their interment eligibility in Arlington National Cemetery. Without these women, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in one of its greatest times of need, our Nation would not stand where it does in the world today. We are indebted to them for their service. The very least that we can do, Mr. Speaker, is to honor them with the dignity and the respect that they have earned and so deserve. We have got to see this policy reversed. I know that we will. It is a bipartisan effort. I am proud to join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in raising attention to this issue and insisting that we ensure that these brave female aviators of World War II, again, who embody the courage and resiliency and patriotism that this country so admires and that we are grateful for, and that we see that they are properly given the honor that they deserve. Again, I want to thank Congresswoman McSally for shedding this light on this misguided injustice. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Langevin. Again, I appreciate your support on this bill and your friendship over the years. I look forward to working together to getting this mission done and then additional things in the future. Thank you so much for your strong support for our heroes. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). She has been a strong advocate, as others who have spoken today, for the WASPs and especially the push for the Congressional Gold Medal. I am just honored to have you as a cosponsor and a strong advocate on this bill. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I am so pleased, so honored, so humbled to be part of your Special Order. In the short time that you have been in Congress, you have been a real leader on so many important issues, and I think none as important as the one that you are spearheading today. I rise today to support you in your mission to give due recognition to the Women Airforce Service Pilots, otherwise known as WASPs, not the other WASPs that you know about. These are the real ladies that got the job done. They are a remarkable group of women who served our country proudly during World War II. As you heard from the other speakers, our country turned to female pilots to deliver planes to our military air bases overseas, tow targets for live antiaircraft artillery practice, and simulate strafing missions. They became the first women in U.S. history to fly for our proud military. Out of more than 25,000 women who applied for the program, only 1,704 were accepted in noncombat roles. These courageous American women logged in more than 60 million miles between 1942 and 1944, but it wasn't until 1977 that Congress passed legislation that gave these patriotic women their much-deserved veteran recognition. In 2002, Arlington National Cemetery decided to allow WASPs, among others listed as Active Duty designees, to receive benefits consistent with the status that they had so rightfully earned. However, the Department of the Army recently rescinded this decision and made these brave women aviators of World War II ineligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. As the author of the legislation--and the gentlewoman and I have talked about this repeatedly--awarding WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal in the year of 2009, I am honored to stand with my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Martha McSally, a true patriot in her own right, to ensure that the WASPs have the right to have these services alongside the rest of our war heroes. These patriotic women selflessly helped defend our country. They deserve full military honor. I am humbled and proud to represent south Florida, and I would like to inform the gentlewoman that this has been home to some of these remarkable heroine women. I am going to mention some of their names: Frances Rohrer Sargent, Helen Wyatt Snapp, Ruth Schafer Fleisher, Shirley Kruse, and Bee Haydu. Some are with us, and some are no longer with us. Some are not in great shape because they served in World War II. It is happening throughout our Nation where we see our finest passing away. In this time of great challenges to women, those women that you have there before us, they pushed beyond the boundaries. They brought new opportunities for women to come. My daughter-in-law, Lindsay, she flew combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan for the Marines, but she would not have been able to do so without the women who came before her. Just as you are a pioneer--to the gentlewoman I say thank you for your patriotic duty--but you stand also on their shoulders. These pioneers fought for the values of freedom and democracy. It is our duty to ensure that they are not denied the recognition for their service. We shouldn't be begging for this. With the valiant efforts of these American heroines, the United States and our allies were able to successfully defeat the Axis Powers during World War II. I thank you, Congresswoman McSally, for introducing this important legislation that would make the Women Airforce Service Pilots eligible, once again, for the services in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. I agree with you that we don't need the legislation; that tonight, the Secretary of the Army could do the right thing, as he had done before, sign the order making this happen. We will continue the battle in their names. Thank you so much to the gentlewoman. Thank you for spearheading [[Page H263]] this effort. Thank you for taking this on. You are a valuable member of this institution. Thank you for the time. Ms. McSALLY. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida. As soon as I mentioned it to Ileana, she was like: This is wrong. We have got to get involved. We have got to fix this. So I appreciate your strong advocacy before I got here, and your continued advocacy as a wingwoman in this cause. You know, for the WASPs in this story and this cause, it is not just the right thing to do for the country. For me, it is also personal. These women opened the door for me to be able to be a pilot in the Air Force and, when the doors were opened, to transition to be a fighter pilot in the Air Force. I will be honest with you, I didn't hear about them when I was in high school. This is one reason why it is so important that we allow them to be laid to rest in Arlington, so that it is part of the education for future generations. It wasn't until I went off to the Air Force Academy that I actually learned about the WASPs and learned about what they did. I just didn't even imagine that we would have women military pilots in the 1940s in World War II, but we did. I got to meet some of these amazing women when I first came to Tucson to fly the A-10 Warthog, started my training. There were several of them that lived in southern Arizona, and I got to become friends with them, and they became mentors to me and encouragers to me. As the doors were opening up for us to transition into fighters, there was hardly anybody we could really look to who understood what it was like to be in challenging circumstances where you are the only woman. People have attitudes about whether you can or cannot or should or should not do what you are doing as an aviator. But these women understood that. They put up with the same biases and the same discrimination as they served. They flew in World War II. As I was looking around for someone to have as a role model, these women were incredible friends to me and supporters and wingwomen to me. Here is one picture I want to show you. This is Ruth Helm, one of the Tucson residents who, sadly, made her final flight over the last year. This is when she was inducted into the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame. This is a picture of the two of us in civilian clothes as she was inducted there. {time} 1945 These women paved the way for me, but they encouraged me. Even at my most challenging times, when I was feeling discouraged, I would sit down with them, and they would just fire me up to live to fight and fly another day. Despite the fact that they were told to leave the military after all they did, they still were proud. They didn't have a chip on their shoulder. They were grateful for the opportunities that they had. They laughed off some of the challenges that they went through. They just started encouraging me, ``Come on, you can do it. We did it.'' I just was able to kind of get back in there and continue to push forward because of what they did before me to open up the doors for me. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. McSALLY. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Obviously we share a compassion and passion for these wonderful women. We also serve on the Committee on Homeland Security together. First of all, let me thank you for your service and thank you so very much for bringing this very important issue, this bipartisan issue to the floor of the House and certainly to your colleagues. I am looking forward to working with you on this issue. I just want to say that one of my greatest joys in the United States Congress was the military war zones that I had the chance to go to, starting with the Bosnian war. I came in in that timeframe and traveled to that area, Kosovo and Albania, and then, of course, Iraq and Afghanistan and certainly a number of other sites where issues of conflict were going on. There I saw a myriad of women who stood on the shoulders of these women, who are now in a variety of the branches, not just aviators or in the Air Force in particular, but they stood on the shoulders of these women. It gave me a sense of pride and duty to say to them, ``Thank you.'' Women are unique. Many of them are mothers or sisters and daughters who are in the service, or they take care of children, or they are nurturers for someone else. We have a particular role, but yet they are in the military leaving their families. Just coming in today, I read an article about the ranger who is from my constituency who just came out of ranger school and is from Houston. I simply want to say, this is the right thing to do. Every year--and I think you have joined us now as you have come to Congress--we go on Memorial Day week to Arlington and lay a wreath for women who died in the line of duty or in the service of their country. Does anyone realize the numbers of women? We have been doing this now for more than a decade, and the women of the House join us. They do that because this is a valuable part of America's history. To the lady, the aviator that now, I wouldn't say languished, but is with her granddaughter, her ashes are with her granddaughter, I want to make a public commitment joining you to say that her ashes should be in a place where she can rest in peace. We should move this quickly. If it requires an independent action by the Army, a reconsideration, I am sure none of us would be offended by the Army rescinding this particular--how should I say it?--action. I just wanted to come and thank you. I want to thank my colleague Susan Davis and all of my colleagues who have been on the floor. I did not want to miss this opportunity. Coming from Texas, I think, as I walk down the streets of Houston or travel throughout the State of Texas, I see veterans and Active Duty everywhere. We are proud of that. In urban centers like Houston, you would think not, but they are dominant there. Just this past Christmas, we had what we call Toys for Kids and honored veterans' families. This is an important mission, and I want to join you in this mission. We have gotten our assignment. We really need to work. I think the American people need to know that all of us will join together to honor either our veterans, our fallen soldiers, or those who were the pioneers who I know the story of, who stood when they were called and did not step away from duty, did not step away from the danger, did not step away from possible death as they pursued the cause of this country and to protect this country. I thank you for yielding to me. I am ready to roll up my sleeves. Let's get busy. Let's help find a resting place for this dear sister and servant of the Nation. Let's find a resting place going forward for all of those who have served this wonderful and great country. They deserve it. Ms. McSALLY. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for joining the conversation tonight, again, to continue to highlight this egregious action that was taken that is putting our heroes in a place, especially Elaine Harmon, right now, where she has nowhere to be able to rest in peace. The place that she wanted to be is denying her, even though her service and the criteria are very clear that she has earned that right. I really appreciate you joining this bipartisan mission. We are not going to rest until the mission is complete. I want to thank the gentlewoman for that. As I was mentioning, this isn't just the right thing to do, but this is personal for me. As I transitioned into fighters, these women, these pioneers who opened up the door for me to even have the opportunity to become a fighter pilot, they mentored me. They walked alongside me. They encouraged me. They gave me some perspectives from their own training and their own experiences. They made me laugh. They made me cry. They were friends who just paved the way for me. You think about the debates we have had in this body over the years. I mean, women couldn't be pilots again in the military until, the late 1970s or early 1980s, they finally opened up the door for women to be pilots. But they could only serve in noncombat roles. [[Page H264]] When they had that debate, that didn't have to be theoretical or hypothetical. They had the example of these amazing women who did what they did in World War II--again, over a thousand of them, under extraordinary circumstances, flying by themselves, often just trying to figure it out in bad weather and how they were going to land and dealing with emergencies and clearances and just doing what it took in order to get the mission done, get the plane where it needed to be, train the men to go off and fly in combat, tow the targets, do the simulated strafing runs, all the test piloting, everything, to include risking their lives. Thirty-eight of them died. This is personal to me. These three women pictured in this photo-- Dawn Seymour, Eleanor Gunderson, and Ruth Helm--they are sitting in this photo in the front row of the change of command ceremony that I had where I took over command of an A-10 fighter squadron, which was an historic day for our country that we finally had a woman doing that. It was an historic day for me to be able to take command of a squadron. I invited them and asked them to sit in the front row. I honored them in my change of command speech because I wanted to make sure that everybody there knew that I only had the opportunities that I had in the military because they paved the way. These three women are personal friends of mine. Two of them have since had their final flight. Dawn Seymour is still with us, but the other two have passed away. We have to keep their legacy going. We have to make sure the next generations know how they served with honor at a time when the country needed them. We have to make sure that Elaine Harmon and any of the other WASPs who want to have their ashes in Arlington Cemetery are allowed to do that. Let's be clear. The only reason these women were not considered Active Duty at the time was because of gender biases and discrimination against women. That is the only reason. Had they been a man doing those jobs, they would have been Active Duty in the Army Air Corps; they would have been discharged honorably; and under the current guidelines, they would have been eligible to have their ashes at Arlington. The only reason they were not Active Duty at the time was because of gender discrimination. Now this is 2016. It is time for that to stop. We thought it was over in 1977 when we finally retroactively gave them that veteran status. They were given those honorable discharges and the medals that they deserved from serving in World War II. We opened up the door for them to have military honors and to be laid to rest in veteran cemeteries around the country. Arlington Cemetery opened up the doors to them finally--a little late, but in 2002. Last March, without telling anybody, they quietly rescinded that. It was just the last slap of gender discrimination against these amazing pioneers. It needs to be overturned immediately. This is the right thing to do for Elaine Harmon and for the other women who are still living. There are about 100 of them who are still with us; and for the next generations who need to know about their service, they deserve to be laid to rest next to the other heroes who are there. The Secretary of the Army has all the authority he needs to let Elaine Harmon's ashes be in Arlington. Let's be clear. This does not take legislation. He has all the authority he needs to make that happen tonight. If he won't do it, the Secretary of Defense can. If he won't do it, then President Obama can. We should not wait another day, Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, before making the decision and calling on Elaine Harmon's family and saying, ``It is approved. Elaine can rest in peace in Arlington National Cemetery,'' which is what she deserved and what she asked for. We should not be lingering another day. As we continue to call on the administration to do the right thing, we are not going to sit by idly. We have got our legislation introduced. We have got almost 80 cosponsors in the House. We have got a Senate version of the bill that was introduced today, led by Senator Mikulski and Senator Ernst, also a bipartisan bill. We are going to continue to push this forward to make this right for our heroes, these Women Airforce Service Pilots, these WASPs. It is the least that we could do for all they have done for us. The last thing I want to say before I close out is that this just seems to be a cruel irony and a cruel contradiction if you think about it. Just last month, the Pentagon announced that they are opening up, finally, all positions in the military to women. It has been a long road to get to that place. I have been a strong advocate for that happening for a very long time. We are a country that is about equal opportunity. We are a country that treats people as individuals. Our foundations are based on not treating people as a class. We should always, and in the military as well, pick the best man for the job, even if it is a woman. It has been a long haul to get over our biases as a country about what we think women as a whole group could or should do in service to our military. Gradually, positions have been opened. Gradually, women have continued to show that, when called, they will serve valiantly and with honor. They will fight and they will die, if needed, for our freedoms and our liberty. At the time that the Pentagon is opening up all positions to women in the military that they are qualified for, they are closing the doors to Arlington for the pioneers who made that happen. That is a cruel hypocrisy and contradiction, and it needs to be made right tonight. So again, I call on the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of Defense, and the President--perhaps he could announce it in his speech tomorrow night--that one of the legacy things that we are going to do for our heroes, for our pioneers, for these amazing women, is to allow them to be laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. We owe it to them. They paved the way as trailblazers. We owe it to them to be able to rest alongside the other heroes and to be able to continue to educate the next generations about their legacy. All I will say to the WASPs is: I have got your back. You had mine, and I have got yours now. It is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H260-H264] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WOMEN AIRFORCE SERVICE PILOTS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about a very special group of women who were mentors to me and who were pioneering heroes of our country. These women were the Women Airforce Service Pilots, the WASPs. Some people don't know that much about them, but here is a picture of them as they flew airplanes in the World War II era. When we needed everybody to serve in whatever capacity one could in our country, they needed women to step up and become pilots in order to do all sorts of different missions, like towing targets for the gunners on the ground to learn how to shoot things down, like training men to go on to fly in combat, like ferrying airplanes all over the theaters to deliver them where they needed to be in the combat zone and bringing them back for maintenance. They were test pilots and engineers. You name it. These women were asked to step up and serve. They went through training. They put on the uniform. They lived in the barracks. They learned how to march. They were pioneers for women like me, who later on served as aviators in the military. There are just a little over 1,000 of these amazing women who served in World War II. They weren't given Active-Duty status, although that was the intent of General Arnold when they set up this program. If you think back then, the thought of having women military pilots was a little bit of a cultural hang-up. We will let women be Rosie the Riveter, and we will let women serve in support positions. But pilots? Now, that is kind of crazy talk. So they had a little bit of a problem culturally, but they didn't care. They chose to serve anyway. They said, ``I am going to step up and serve my country. I am going to do that as a pilot. I am going to do this with honor and with valor,'' just like their male counterparts did in these very same missions before them, alongside them, and then after them. Thirty-eight of them died in training or in conducting missions. Thirty-eight of them paid the ultimate sacrifice. They weren't even given veterans' benefits or any benefits after perishing in the line of duty, but they still continued to serve because their country needed them. It was not until 1977 that they were actually given veteran status after the fact. They were then given honorable discharges. They were given the medals that their male counterparts got for serving as Active Duty in the military. They were allowed to be buried, with honors, in veterans' cemeteries across the country and were given full military honors, which they deserved. They were actually allowed, as they should be allowed, to be in Arlington National Cemetery, alongside other heroes who have gone before them. Yet, we just found out within the last few weeks that that has been rescinded by the Department of Army. That happened quietly back in March of 2015 to these heroes, who deserve to be recognized and who deserve to be a legacy in Arlington National Cemetery so that future generations will know what they did and will know of the doors that they opened in the way that they served. It was rescinded by the Army. We didn't know about this until Elaine Harmon, one of the WASPs, passed away. I saw her handwritten will when I me with her family last week. It reads, ``I desire to be in Arlington National Cemetery. I want my ashes there.'' Her family put in the request like everybody else does, and they were denied. We now found out that the Army has rescinded that and that it is no longer allowing these pioneering women to be laid to rest in Arlington. Elaine Harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet in her granddaughter's home, awaiting her final resting place in Arlington, which she deserves. The Army gave us some bureaucratic answer about, oh, they are running out of space, and, by mistake, they opened it up. In 2002, they actually allowed women to be in Arlington. Only two women took advantage of this and asked to be, in their own right, in Arlington. Then the Army turned around and rescinded it. Again, they gave some bureaucratic answer. They are on the wrong side of this. We have looked into all of the legalities. The Army has all of the authorities that they need to allow these heroes to be laid to rest in Arlington, but they are choosing not to do so. We have introduced legislation. We are going to make sure that it happens, but we are calling on them to actually [[Page H261]] change it tonight. Right now, the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of Defense or the President could tonight say: Do you know what? Elaine Harmon and the other WASPs--there are only a little over 100 who are still living--are going to be allowed to have their ashes in Arlington National Cemetery alongside other heroes. This is the least they could do, and they could do it tonight. So I am leading the Special Order tonight. This is a bipartisan Special Order. This is bipartisan legislation, and it is bicameral. When we raised awareness of this issue and got the legislation together, we had nearly 80 sponsors right away on this bill who said: Let's change this thing. Today the Senate introduced a similar bill, and we are going to work together to get this thing done. We want to continue to raise awareness to this issue, this egregious violation of these women. We want this thing changed now. It takes a little bit of time sometimes around here to work through legislation. In the meantime, Elaine Harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet. That is not the way we treat our heroes. That is not the way we treat our pioneers who paved the way for military aviators, like me, to be able to serve in the way we did, and it needs to be changed tonight. We have a number of individuals here on both sides of the aisle who are going to be sharing this time with me tonight. I first yield to my good friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), who is the lead Democratic cosponsor of this bill. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Thank you so much. I am so glad that my colleague from Arizona is here to speak to this. She is very uniquely qualified to do that as one of the first women pilots--or the first--to actually fly in combat. As I remember, the women who joined us a few years ago here in the Capitol who were part of the WASPs were here to receive Gold Medals for their heroic acts during the war and for really coming forward and being part of that volunteer band of women who had had some experience in flying, but who could not have imagined in their wildest dreams doing what they were asked to do, but they were delighted to do it. As I will share, they actually wanted to do more, but there were some other people who took over and asked them to go home and enjoy their lives after they had given so much. So I am just delighted to join in this effort and to right this injustice for military trailblazers who were truly ahead of their time. When the call came to serve in World War II, the WASPs answered that call just like millions of other Americans. They logged over 60 million miles in over 12,000 aircraft. As my colleague has said, 38 WASP women died while serving their country. In 2009, as I mentioned, the WASPs were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for flying military missions in World War II. Boy, even when they were here, they were just a strong group of women who delighted in seeing one another and in reminding themselves of the amazing stories that they brought. More than anything else, they serve today as great role models to women who were considering going in the Air Force, of course, and in the Navy, flying for our country, but, also, for taking on some remarkable challenges in their lives. They really represent that for all of us. They fought, of course, and they died in service to their country. They trained in military style. They slept on metal cots like everybody else and marched and lived under military discipline. That is why we feel they deserve the full honors that we give our war heroes. As has been mentioned, they were given those honors, but because we have a problem of space, it was decided that perhaps they were not at the top of the list. We need to be sure that we provide for everyone who needs to be there. There are many WASPs who may not necessarily choose to be at Arlington National Cemetery, but for those who have chosen in working with their families--and their families have fought hard for them--this is something that we need to do. I want to particularly mention--and I thought this was really fun to read--one of the articles about these WASPs. This is Eddy, who is saying, ``I thought it was the nastiest thing that they''--speaking of the Army Air Forces officials--``could have done to us.'' This was while she was receiving visitors at her home in Coronado. ``They fired us. They gave our jobs to Air Force men who didn't want to go overseas. I would have gone overseas in a minute,'' she said. ``I was a (heck of) a good fighter pilot.'' In my community of San Diego, in El Cajon, I also have a woman named Joyce Secciani, who perhaps was not as forthright as Eddy. But despite some fading memories, at 87, she still shares Vivian's passion for the WASPs and her disappointment with its demise. She was also one of the 1,102 women who flew in the all-volunteer program between 1942 and 1944. She remarked, ``All of us felt bad to lose (our flying jobs)--all of us wanted to keep up our ability to fly,'' because they knew that, with prevailing chauvinistic attitudes, there would be no pilots' work for them in the civilian realm. We need to be sure that we don't lose our perspective about the work that these women did and that we honor them in this way, that we honor them and their families who supported them as well, because we know, with all of our military families, it is not just the person who serves, but it is the entire family who serves as well. That was certainly true of these WASPs, whose family members worried about them and were concerned about them as they carried on with their duties as forcibly as they did. Let's send that message. Let's continue to work hard. I know that the WASPs are also planning a museum to honor them and to make sure that the country never forgets the work that they did because it was necessary. Had they not been there to do that work, many, many people would not have received the materials. Whatever it was, they were making sure that it got to our fighting warriors during World War II. {time} 1930 I am so delighted that my colleague is choosing to move forward with this. I want to turn it back to her, and I know that there are other colleagues of mine over here that would like very much to join in this. Ms. McSALLY. Thank you, Congresswoman Davis. I really appreciate your partnership on this issue. Together we can show the American people that we can be united on these things that matter to support our veterans and support our heroes and, again, put the pressure on the administration that we have oversight of to actually fix this wrong right now. I really look forward to continuing working with you on it. I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who is joining this discussion as a cosponsor on the bill, very strongly supporting this initiative. Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman. I don't think it much matters if you are a man or you are a woman, but you serve in the United States military. Anybody who has stood up for this country to protect our freedom, protect our way of life, protect our kids, they should receive the full benefits, the full honors of anybody who served in uniform. Now, tonight, as Congresswoman McSally said, we can fix this. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why the Pentagon should, for some reason, say there is no room at Arlington. Are you kidding me? Over 1,000 of these brave, patriotic women, during a time where, as Congresswoman McSally and Congresswoman Davis mentioned, they were not always welcomed in doing what men were doing, they stood up, they stood up and they left their homes and they left their families. They did what was right. They served this country with honor, with dignity. They flew 78 different types of aircraft all over the world. Over 60 million miles were logged. Look at this picture. I salute you, Congresswoman, for bringing this before us. Now, do you think any of these WASPs were saying, ``Well, I don't know, we just can't get this done, we just can't perform this mission, I am sorry''? Well, the Pentagon needs to step up right now. They need to find a [[Page H262]] way to make sure, if these WASPs want to be interred at Arlington, they should be. Now, some of the missions that these brave women flew on included transporting these vehicles all around the world. You know what they also did? They towed targets for men on the ground that were practicing artillery. Did you hear one of these WASPs complain, ``Gee, I hope that these men will hit the targets instead of us''? The least the Pentagon can do is to take this seriously, listen to the will of the people, and make sure that these brave women are so honored by being interred, if they wish, at Arlington. Now, one of these humble American heroes is a woman by the name of Betty Anne Brown, who very recently passed away at age 92. Now, wouldn't she be proud of all of us today standing up and asking that our country, that the Pentagon does the right thing? I salute Ms. McSally for her leadership on this issue. The Pentagon can do what is right today. As you mentioned, Congresswoman, legislation is not needed if our Commander in Chief or the folks who run the Pentagon stand up and do what is right. These women deserve every right to be buried at Arlington if they so wish. Thank you very much, and I am honored to cosponsor this bill. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Poliquin. I really appreciate his strong support and strong words in support of this effort here. I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my good friend. I think back to how many years ago it was this week, actually, when I was your guest at the State of the Union Address. So I have appreciated your support to me when I was in the military and the fights that we had to make sure that women were treated fairly and, also, your strong support on this particular effort. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman McSally for yielding. I want to thank her for bringing our attention to this important issue this evening. I am proud to serve with her on the House Armed Services Committee. I know she is very proud to represent the people of Arizona in the Second Congressional District there. I might make note that Ms. McSally's roots are from my home State of Rhode Island. She and I grew up in the same neighborhood, and I am proud to have worked with her on several issues since she has arrived in Congress. I was proud, again, back then to have her as my guest to the State of the Union Message as she mentioned. Again, I thank you for raising this important issue. I find it completely disheartening that the Women Airforce Service Pilots have been denied interment in one of our Nation's most sacred national burial grounds where we honor our men and women who have served. These brave female aviators of World War II embody courage, resiliency, and patriotism. Again, I am proud to support Congresswoman McSally's efforts to reinstate their interment eligibility in Arlington National Cemetery. Without these women, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in one of its greatest times of need, our Nation would not stand where it does in the world today. We are indebted to them for their service. The very least that we can do, Mr. Speaker, is to honor them with the dignity and the respect that they have earned and so deserve. We have got to see this policy reversed. I know that we will. It is a bipartisan effort. I am proud to join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in raising attention to this issue and insisting that we ensure that these brave female aviators of World War II, again, who embody the courage and resiliency and patriotism that this country so admires and that we are grateful for, and that we see that they are properly given the honor that they deserve. Again, I want to thank Congresswoman McSally for shedding this light on this misguided injustice. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Langevin. Again, I appreciate your support on this bill and your friendship over the years. I look forward to working together to getting this mission done and then additional things in the future. Thank you so much for your strong support for our heroes. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). She has been a strong advocate, as others who have spoken today, for the WASPs and especially the push for the Congressional Gold Medal. I am just honored to have you as a cosponsor and a strong advocate on this bill. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I am so pleased, so honored, so humbled to be part of your Special Order. In the short time that you have been in Congress, you have been a real leader on so many important issues, and I think none as important as the one that you are spearheading today. I rise today to support you in your mission to give due recognition to the Women Airforce Service Pilots, otherwise known as WASPs, not the other WASPs that you know about. These are the real ladies that got the job done. They are a remarkable group of women who served our country proudly during World War II. As you heard from the other speakers, our country turned to female pilots to deliver planes to our military air bases overseas, tow targets for live antiaircraft artillery practice, and simulate strafing missions. They became the first women in U.S. history to fly for our proud military. Out of more than 25,000 women who applied for the program, only 1,704 were accepted in noncombat roles. These courageous American women logged in more than 60 million miles between 1942 and 1944, but it wasn't until 1977 that Congress passed legislation that gave these patriotic women their much-deserved veteran recognition. In 2002, Arlington National Cemetery decided to allow WASPs, among others listed as Active Duty designees, to receive benefits consistent with the status that they had so rightfully earned. However, the Department of the Army recently rescinded this decision and made these brave women aviators of World War II ineligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. As the author of the legislation--and the gentlewoman and I have talked about this repeatedly--awarding WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal in the year of 2009, I am honored to stand with my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Martha McSally, a true patriot in her own right, to ensure that the WASPs have the right to have these services alongside the rest of our war heroes. These patriotic women selflessly helped defend our country. They deserve full military honor. I am humbled and proud to represent south Florida, and I would like to inform the gentlewoman that this has been home to some of these remarkable heroine women. I am going to mention some of their names: Frances Rohrer Sargent, Helen Wyatt Snapp, Ruth Schafer Fleisher, Shirley Kruse, and Bee Haydu. Some are with us, and some are no longer with us. Some are not in great shape because they served in World War II. It is happening throughout our Nation where we see our finest passing away. In this time of great challenges to women, those women that you have there before us, they pushed beyond the boundaries. They brought new opportunities for women to come. My daughter-in-law, Lindsay, she flew combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan for the Marines, but she would not have been able to do so without the women who came before her. Just as you are a pioneer--to the gentlewoman I say thank you for your patriotic duty--but you stand also on their shoulders. These pioneers fought for the values of freedom and democracy. It is our duty to ensure that they are not denied the recognition for their service. We shouldn't be begging for this. With the valiant efforts of these American heroines, the United States and our allies were able to successfully defeat the Axis Powers during World War II. I thank you, Congresswoman McSally, for introducing this important legislation that would make the Women Airforce Service Pilots eligible, once again, for the services in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. I agree with you that we don't need the legislation; that tonight, the Secretary of the Army could do the right thing, as he had done before, sign the order making this happen. We will continue the battle in their names. Thank you so much to the gentlewoman. Thank you for spearheading [[Page H263]] this effort. Thank you for taking this on. You are a valuable member of this institution. Thank you for the time. Ms. McSALLY. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida. As soon as I mentioned it to Ileana, she was like: This is wrong. We have got to get involved. We have got to fix this. So I appreciate your strong advocacy before I got here, and your continued advocacy as a wingwoman in this cause. You know, for the WASPs in this story and this cause, it is not just the right thing to do for the country. For me, it is also personal. These women opened the door for me to be able to be a pilot in the Air Force and, when the doors were opened, to transition to be a fighter pilot in the Air Force. I will be honest with you, I didn't hear about them when I was in high school. This is one reason why it is so important that we allow them to be laid to rest in Arlington, so that it is part of the education for future generations. It wasn't until I went off to the Air Force Academy that I actually learned about the WASPs and learned about what they did. I just didn't even imagine that we would have women military pilots in the 1940s in World War II, but we did. I got to meet some of these amazing women when I first came to Tucson to fly the A-10 Warthog, started my training. There were several of them that lived in southern Arizona, and I got to become friends with them, and they became mentors to me and encouragers to me. As the doors were opening up for us to transition into fighters, there was hardly anybody we could really look to who understood what it was like to be in challenging circumstances where you are the only woman. People have attitudes about whether you can or cannot or should or should not do what you are doing as an aviator. But these women understood that. They put up with the same biases and the same discrimination as they served. They flew in World War II. As I was looking around for someone to have as a role model, these women were incredible friends to me and supporters and wingwomen to me. Here is one picture I want to show you. This is Ruth Helm, one of the Tucson residents who, sadly, made her final flight over the last year. This is when she was inducted into the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame. This is a picture of the two of us in civilian clothes as she was inducted there. {time} 1945 These women paved the way for me, but they encouraged me. Even at my most challenging times, when I was feeling discouraged, I would sit down with them, and they would just fire me up to live to fight and fly another day. Despite the fact that they were told to leave the military after all they did, they still were proud. They didn't have a chip on their shoulder. They were grateful for the opportunities that they had. They laughed off some of the challenges that they went through. They just started encouraging me, ``Come on, you can do it. We did it.'' I just was able to kind of get back in there and continue to push forward because of what they did before me to open up the doors for me. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. McSALLY. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Obviously we share a compassion and passion for these wonderful women. We also serve on the Committee on Homeland Security together. First of all, let me thank you for your service and thank you so very much for bringing this very important issue, this bipartisan issue to the floor of the House and certainly to your colleagues. I am looking forward to working with you on this issue. I just want to say that one of my greatest joys in the United States Congress was the military war zones that I had the chance to go to, starting with the Bosnian war. I came in in that timeframe and traveled to that area, Kosovo and Albania, and then, of course, Iraq and Afghanistan and certainly a number of other sites where issues of conflict were going on. There I saw a myriad of women who stood on the shoulders of these women, who are now in a variety of the branches, not just aviators or in the Air Force in particular, but they stood on the shoulders of these women. It gave me a sense of pride and duty to say to them, ``Thank you.'' Women are unique. Many of them are mothers or sisters and daughters who are in the service, or they take care of children, or they are nurturers for someone else. We have a particular role, but yet they are in the military leaving their families. Just coming in today, I read an article about the ranger who is from my constituency who just came out of ranger school and is from Houston. I simply want to say, this is the right thing to do. Every year--and I think you have joined us now as you have come to Congress--we go on Memorial Day week to Arlington and lay a wreath for women who died in the line of duty or in the service of their country. Does anyone realize the numbers of women? We have been doing this now for more than a decade, and the women of the House join us. They do that because this is a valuable part of America's history. To the lady, the aviator that now, I wouldn't say languished, but is with her granddaughter, her ashes are with her granddaughter, I want to make a public commitment joining you to say that her ashes should be in a place where she can rest in peace. We should move this quickly. If it requires an independent action by the Army, a reconsideration, I am sure none of us would be offended by the Army rescinding this particular--how should I say it?--action. I just wanted to come and thank you. I want to thank my colleague Susan Davis and all of my colleagues who have been on the floor. I did not want to miss this opportunity. Coming from Texas, I think, as I walk down the streets of Houston or travel throughout the State of Texas, I see veterans and Active Duty everywhere. We are proud of that. In urban centers like Houston, you would think not, but they are dominant there. Just this past Christmas, we had what we call Toys for Kids and honored veterans' families. This is an important mission, and I want to join you in this mission. We have gotten our assignment. We really need to work. I think the American people need to know that all of us will join together to honor either our veterans, our fallen soldiers, or those who were the pioneers who I know the story of, who stood when they were called and did not step away from duty, did not step away from the danger, did not step away from possible death as they pursued the cause of this country and to protect this country. I thank you for yielding to me. I am ready to roll up my sleeves. Let's get busy. Let's help find a resting place for this dear sister and servant of the Nation. Let's find a resting place going forward for all of those who have served this wonderful and great country. They deserve it. Ms. McSALLY. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for joining the conversation tonight, again, to continue to highlight this egregious action that was taken that is putting our heroes in a place, especially Elaine Harmon, right now, where she has nowhere to be able to rest in peace. The place that she wanted to be is denying her, even though her service and the criteria are very clear that she has earned that right. I really appreciate you joining this bipartisan mission. We are not going to rest until the mission is complete. I want to thank the gentlewoman for that. As I was mentioning, this isn't just the right thing to do, but this is personal for me. As I transitioned into fighters, these women, these pioneers who opened up the door for me to even have the opportunity to become a fighter pilot, they mentored me. They walked alongside me. They encouraged me. They gave me some perspectives from their own training and their own experiences. They made me laugh. They made me cry. They were friends who just paved the way for me. You think about the debates we have had in this body over the years. I mean, women couldn't be pilots again in the military until, the late 1970s or early 1980s, they finally opened up the door for women to be pilots. But they could only serve in noncombat roles. [[Page H264]] When they had that debate, that didn't have to be theoretical or hypothetical. They had the example of these amazing women who did what they did in World War II--again, over a thousand of them, under extraordinary circumstances, flying by themselves, often just trying to figure it out in bad weather and how they were going to land and dealing with emergencies and clearances and just doing what it took in order to get the mission done, get the plane where it needed to be, train the men to go off and fly in combat, tow the targets, do the simulated strafing runs, all the test piloting, everything, to include risking their lives. Thirty-eight of them died. This is personal to me. These three women pictured in this photo-- Dawn Seymour, Eleanor Gunderson, and Ruth Helm--they are sitting in this photo in the front row of the change of command ceremony that I had where I took over command of an A-10 fighter squadron, which was an historic day for our country that we finally had a woman doing that. It was an historic day for me to be able to take command of a squadron. I invited them and asked them to sit in the front row. I honored them in my change of command speech because I wanted to make sure that everybody there knew that I only had the opportunities that I had in the military because they paved the way. These three women are personal friends of mine. Two of them have since had their final flight. Dawn Seymour is still with us, but the other two have passed away. We have to keep their legacy going. We have to make sure the next generations know how they served with honor at a time when the country needed them. We have to make sure that Elaine Harmon and any of the other WASPs who want to have their ashes in Arlington Cemetery are allowed to do that. Let's be clear. The only reason these women were not considered Active Duty at the time was because of gender biases and discrimination against women. That is the only reason. Had they been a man doing those jobs, they would have been Active Duty in the Army Air Corps; they would have been discharged honorably; and under the current guidelines, they would have been eligible to have their ashes at Arlington. The only reason they were not Active Duty at the time was because of gender discrimination. Now this is 2016. It is time for that to stop. We thought it was over in 1977 when we finally retroactively gave them that veteran status. They were given those honorable discharges and the medals that they deserved from serving in World War II. We opened up the door for them to have military honors and to be laid to rest in veteran cemeteries around the country. Arlington Cemetery opened up the doors to them finally--a little late, but in 2002. Last March, without telling anybody, they quietly rescinded that. It was just the last slap of gender discrimination against these amazing pioneers. It needs to be overturned immediately. This is the right thing to do for Elaine Harmon and for the other women who are still living. There are about 100 of them who are still with us; and for the next generations who need to know about their service, they deserve to be laid to rest next to the other heroes who are there. The Secretary of the Army has all the authority he needs to let Elaine Harmon's ashes be in Arlington. Let's be clear. This does not take legislation. He has all the authority he needs to make that happen tonight. If he won't do it, the Secretary of Defense can. If he won't do it, then President Obama can. We should not wait another day, Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, before making the decision and calling on Elaine Harmon's family and saying, ``It is approved. Elaine can rest in peace in Arlington National Cemetery,'' which is what she deserved and what she asked for. We should not be lingering another day. As we continue to call on the administration to do the right thing, we are not going to sit by idly. We have got our legislation introduced. We have got almost 80 cosponsors in the House. We have got a Senate version of the bill that was introduced today, led by Senator Mikulski and Senator Ernst, also a bipartisan bill. We are going to continue to push this forward to make this right for our heroes, these Women Airforce Service Pilots, these WASPs. It is the least that we could do for all they have done for us. The last thing I want to say before I close out is that this just seems to be a cruel irony and a cruel contradiction if you think about it. Just last month, the Pentagon announced that they are opening up, finally, all positions in the military to women. It has been a long road to get to that place. I have been a strong advocate for that happening for a very long time. We are a country that is about equal opportunity. We are a country that treats people as individuals. Our foundations are based on not treating people as a class. We should always, and in the military as well, pick the best man for the job, even if it is a woman. It has been a long haul to get over our biases as a country about what we think women as a whole group could or should do in service to our military. Gradually, positions have been opened. Gradually, women have continued to show that, when called, they will serve valiantly and with honor. They will fight and they will die, if needed, for our freedoms and our liberty. At the time that the Pentagon is opening up all positions to women in the military that they are qualified for, they are closing the doors to Arlington for the pioneers who made that happen. That is a cruel hypocrisy and contradiction, and it needs to be made right tonight. So again, I call on the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of Defense, and the President--perhaps he could announce it in his speech tomorrow night--that one of the legacy things that we are going to do for our heroes, for our pioneers, for these amazing women, is to allow them to be laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. We owe it to them. They paved the way as trailblazers. We owe it to them to be able to rest alongside the other heroes and to be able to continue to educate the next generations about their legacy. All I will say to the WASPs is: I have got your back. You had mine, and I have got yours now. It is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_238.csv,36048,36048,36116,"[congressional record volume 162, number 6 (monday, january 11, 2016)] [house] [pages h260-h264] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] women airforce service pilots the speaker pro tempore (mr. hardy). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. mcsally) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. general leave ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from arizona? there was no objection. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i rise to talk about a very special group of women who were mentors to me and who were pioneering heroes of our country. these women were the women airforce service pilots, the wasps. some people don't know that much about them, but here is a picture of them as they flew airplanes in the world war ii era. when we needed everybody to serve in whatever capacity one could in our country, they needed women to step up and become pilots in order to do all sorts of different missions, like towing targets for the gunners on the ground to learn how to shoot things down, like training men to go on to fly in combat, like ferrying airplanes all over the theaters to deliver them where they needed to be in the combat zone and bringing them back for maintenance. they were test pilots and engineers. you name it. these women were asked to step up and serve. they went through training. they put on the uniform. they lived in the barracks. they learned how to march. they were pioneers for women like me, who later on served as aviators in the military. there are just a little over 1,000 of these amazing women who served in world war ii. they weren't given active-duty status, although that was the intent of general arnold when they set up this program. if you think back then, the thought of having women military pilots was a little bit of a cultural hang-up. we will let women be rosie the riveter, and we will let women serve in support positions. but pilots? now, that is kind of crazy talk. so they had a little bit of a problem culturally, but they didn't care. they chose to serve anyway. they said, ``i am going to step up and serve my country. i am going to do that as a pilot. i am going to do this with honor and with valor,'' just like their male counterparts did in these very same missions before them, alongside them, and then after them. thirty-eight of them died in training or in conducting missions. thirty-eight of them paid the ultimate sacrifice. they weren't even given veterans' benefits or any benefits after perishing in the line of duty, but they still continued to serve because their country needed them. it was not until 1977 that they were actually given veteran status after the fact. they were then given honorable discharges. they were given the medals that their male counterparts got for serving as active duty in the military. they were allowed to be buried, with honors, in veterans' cemeteries across the country and were given full military honors, which they deserved. they were actually allowed, as they should be allowed, to be in arlington national cemetery, alongside other heroes who have gone before them. yet, we just found out within the last few weeks that that has been rescinded by the department of army. that happened quietly back in march of 2015 to these heroes, who deserve to be recognized and who deserve to be a legacy in arlington national cemetery so that future generations will know what they did and will know of the doors that they opened in the way that they served. it was rescinded by the army. we didn't know about this until elaine harmon, one of the wasps, passed away. i saw her handwritten will when i me with her family last week. it reads, ``i desire to be in arlington national cemetery. i want my ashes there.'' her family put in the request like everybody else does, and they were denied. we now found out that the army has rescinded that and that it is no longer allowing these pioneering women to be laid to rest in arlington. elaine harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet in her granddaughter's home, awaiting her final resting place in arlington, which she deserves. the army gave us some bureaucratic answer about, oh, they are running out of space, and, by mistake, they opened it up. in 2002, they actually allowed women to be in arlington. only two women took advantage of this and asked to be, in their own right, in arlington. then the army turned around and rescinded it. again, they gave some bureaucratic answer. they are on the wrong side of this. we have looked into all of the legalities. the army has all of the authorities that they need to allow these heroes to be laid to rest in arlington, but they are choosing not to do so. we have introduced legislation. we are going to make sure that it happens, but we are calling on them to actually [[page h261]] change it tonight. right now, the secretary of the army or the secretary of defense or the president could tonight say: do you know what? elaine harmon and the other wasps--there are only a little over 100 who are still living--are going to be allowed to have their ashes in arlington national cemetery alongside other heroes. this is the least they could do, and they could do it tonight. so i am leading the special order tonight. this is a bipartisan special order. this is bipartisan legislation, and it is bicameral. when we raised awareness of this issue and got the legislation together, we had nearly 80 sponsors right away on this bill who said: let's change this thing. today the senate introduced a similar bill, and we are going to work together to get this thing done. we want to continue to raise awareness to this issue, this egregious violation of these women. we want this thing changed now. it takes a little bit of time sometimes around here to work through legislation. in the meantime, elaine harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet. that is not the way we treat our heroes. that is not the way we treat our pioneers who paved the way for military aviators, like me, to be able to serve in the way we did, and it needs to be changed tonight. we have a number of individuals here on both sides of the aisle who are going to be sharing this time with me tonight. i first yield to my good friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from california (mrs. davis), who is the lead democratic cosponsor of this bill. mrs. davis of california. thank you so much. i am so glad that my colleague from arizona is here to speak to this. she is very uniquely qualified to do that as one of the first women pilots--or the first--to actually fly in combat. as i remember, the women who joined us a few years ago here in the capitol who were part of the wasps were here to receive gold medals for their heroic acts during the war and for really coming forward and being part of that volunteer band of women who had had some experience in flying, but who could not have imagined in their wildest dreams doing what they were asked to do, but they were delighted to do it. as i will share, they actually wanted to do more, but there were some other people who took over and asked them to go home and enjoy their lives after they had given so much. so i am just delighted to join in this effort and to right this injustice for military trailblazers who were truly ahead of their time. when the call came to serve in world war ii, the wasps answered that call just like millions of other americans. they logged over 60 million miles in over 12,000 aircraft. as my colleague has said, 38 wasp women died while serving their country. in 2009, as i mentioned, the wasps were awarded the congressional gold medal for flying military missions in world war ii. boy, even when they were here, they were just a strong group of women who delighted in seeing one another and in reminding themselves of the amazing stories that they brought. more than anything else, they serve today as great role models to women who were considering going in the air force, of course, and in the navy, flying for our country, but, also, for taking on some remarkable challenges in their lives. they really represent that for all of us. they fought, of course, and they died in service to their country. they trained in military style. they slept on metal cots like everybody else and marched and lived under military discipline. that is why we feel they deserve the full honors that we give our war heroes. as has been mentioned, they were given those honors, but because we have a problem of space, it was decided that perhaps they were not at the top of the list. we need to be sure that we provide for everyone who needs to be there. there are many wasps who may not necessarily choose to be at arlington national cemetery, but for those who have chosen in working with their families--and their families have fought hard for them--this is something that we need to do. i want to particularly mention--and i thought this was really fun to read--one of the articles about these wasps. this is eddy, who is saying, ``i thought it was the nastiest thing that they''--speaking of the army air forces officials--``could have done to us.'' this was while she was receiving visitors at her home in coronado. ``they fired us. they gave our jobs to air force men who didn't want to go overseas. i would have gone overseas in a minute,'' she said. ``i was a (heck of) a good fighter pilot.'' in my community of san diego, in el cajon, i also have a woman named joyce secciani, who perhaps was not as forthright as eddy. but despite some fading memories, at 87, she still shares vivian's passion for the wasps and her disappointment with its demise. she was also one of the 1,102 women who flew in the all-volunteer program between 1942 and 1944. she remarked, ``all of us felt bad to lose (our flying jobs)--all of us wanted to keep up our ability to fly,'' because they knew that, with prevailing chauvinistic attitudes, there would be no pilots' work for them in the civilian realm. we need to be sure that we don't lose our perspective about the work that these women did and that we honor them in this way, that we honor them and their families who supported them as well, because we know, with all of our military families, it is not just the person who serves, but it is the entire family who serves as well. that was certainly true of these wasps, whose family members worried about them and were concerned about them as they carried on with their duties as forcibly as they did. let's send that message. let's continue to work hard. i know that the wasps are also planning a museum to honor them and to make sure that the country never forgets the work that they did because it was necessary. had they not been there to do that work, many, many people would not have received the materials. whatever it was, they were making sure that it got to our fighting warriors during world war ii. {time} 1930 i am so delighted that my colleague is choosing to move forward with this. i want to turn it back to her, and i know that there are other colleagues of mine over here that would like very much to join in this. ms. mcsally. thank you, congresswoman davis. i really appreciate your partnership on this issue. together we can show the american people that we can be united on these things that matter to support our veterans and support our heroes and, again, put the pressure on the administration that we have oversight of to actually fix this wrong right now. i really look forward to continuing working with you on it. i yield to the gentleman from maine (mr. poliquin), who is joining this discussion as a cosponsor on the bill, very strongly supporting this initiative. mr. poliquin. mr. speaker, i thank the congresswoman. i don't think it much matters if you are a man or you are a woman, but you serve in the united states military. anybody who has stood up for this country to protect our freedom, protect our way of life, protect our kids, they should receive the full benefits, the full honors of anybody who served in uniform. now, tonight, as congresswoman mcsally said, we can fix this. there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why the pentagon should, for some reason, say there is no room at arlington. are you kidding me? over 1,000 of these brave, patriotic women, during a time where, as congresswoman mcsally and congresswoman davis mentioned, they were not always welcomed in doing what men were doing, they stood up, they stood up and they left their homes and they left their families. they did what was right. they served this country with honor, with dignity. they flew 78 different types of aircraft all over the world. over 60 million miles were logged. look at this picture. i salute you, congresswoman, for bringing this before us. now, do you think any of these wasps were saying, ``well, i don't know, we just can't get this done, we just can't perform this mission, i am sorry''? well, the pentagon needs to step up right now. they need to find a [[page h262]] way to make sure, if these wasps want to be interred at arlington, they should be. now, some of the missions that these brave women flew on included transporting these vehicles all around the world. you know what they also did? they towed targets for men on the ground that were practicing artillery. did you hear one of these wasps complain, ``gee, i hope that these men will hit the targets instead of us''? the least the pentagon can do is to take this seriously, listen to the will of the people, and make sure that these brave women are so honored by being interred, if they wish, at arlington. now, one of these humble american heroes is a woman by the name of betty anne brown, who very recently passed away at age 92. now, wouldn't she be proud of all of us today standing up and asking that our country, that the pentagon does the right thing? i salute ms. mcsally for her leadership on this issue. the pentagon can do what is right today. as you mentioned, congresswoman, legislation is not needed if our commander in chief or the folks who run the pentagon stand up and do what is right. these women deserve every right to be buried at arlington if they so wish. thank you very much, and i am honored to cosponsor this bill. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i thank mr. poliquin. i really appreciate his strong support and strong words in support of this effort here. i yield to the gentleman from rhode island (mr. langevin), my good friend. i think back to how many years ago it was this week, actually, when i was your guest at the state of the union address. so i have appreciated your support to me when i was in the military and the fights that we had to make sure that women were treated fairly and, also, your strong support on this particular effort. mr. langevin. mr. speaker, i thank congresswoman mcsally for yielding. i want to thank her for bringing our attention to this important issue this evening. i am proud to serve with her on the house armed services committee. i know she is very proud to represent the people of arizona in the second congressional district there. i might make note that ms. mcsally's roots are from my home state of rhode island. she and i grew up in the same neighborhood, and i am proud to have worked with her on several issues since she has arrived in congress. i was proud, again, back then to have her as my guest to the state of the union message as she mentioned. again, i thank you for raising this important issue. i find it completely disheartening that the women airforce service pilots have been denied interment in one of our nation's most sacred national burial grounds where we honor our men and women who have served. these brave female aviators of world war ii embody courage, resiliency, and patriotism. again, i am proud to support congresswoman mcsally's efforts to reinstate their interment eligibility in arlington national cemetery. without these women, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in one of its greatest times of need, our nation would not stand where it does in the world today. we are indebted to them for their service. the very least that we can do, mr. speaker, is to honor them with the dignity and the respect that they have earned and so deserve. we have got to see this policy reversed. i know that we will. it is a bipartisan effort. i am proud to join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in raising attention to this issue and insisting that we ensure that these brave female aviators of world war ii, again, who embody the courage and resiliency and patriotism that this country so admires and that we are grateful for, and that we see that they are properly given the honor that they deserve. again, i want to thank congresswoman mcsally for shedding this light on this misguided injustice. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i thank mr. langevin. again, i appreciate your support on this bill and your friendship over the years. i look forward to working together to getting this mission done and then additional things in the future. thank you so much for your strong support for our heroes. i yield to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen). she has been a strong advocate, as others who have spoken today, for the wasps and especially the push for the congressional gold medal. i am just honored to have you as a cosponsor and a strong advocate on this bill. ms. ros-lehtinen. i am so pleased, so honored, so humbled to be part of your special order. in the short time that you have been in congress, you have been a real leader on so many important issues, and i think none as important as the one that you are spearheading today. i rise today to support you in your mission to give due recognition to the women airforce service pilots, otherwise known as wasps, not the other wasps that you know about. these are the real ladies that got the job done. they are a remarkable group of women who served our country proudly during world war ii. as you heard from the other speakers, our country turned to female pilots to deliver planes to our military air bases overseas, tow targets for live antiaircraft artillery practice, and simulate strafing missions. they became the first women in u.s. history to fly for our proud military. out of more than 25,000 women who applied for the program, only 1,704 were accepted in noncombat roles. these courageous american women logged in more than 60 million miles between 1942 and 1944, but it wasn't until 1977 that congress passed legislation that gave these patriotic women their much-deserved veteran recognition. in 2002, arlington national cemetery decided to allow wasps, among others listed as active duty designees, to receive benefits consistent with the status that they had so rightfully earned. however, the department of the army recently rescinded this decision and made these brave women aviators of world war ii ineligible for burial at arlington national cemetery. as the author of the legislation--and the gentlewoman and i have talked about this repeatedly--awarding wasps the congressional gold medal in the year of 2009, i am honored to stand with my friend and colleague, congresswoman martha mcsally, a true patriot in her own right, to ensure that the wasps have the right to have these services alongside the rest of our war heroes. these patriotic women selflessly helped defend our country. they deserve full military honor. i am humbled and proud to represent south florida, and i would like to inform the gentlewoman that this has been home to some of these remarkable heroine women. i am going to mention some of their names: frances rohrer sargent, helen wyatt snapp, ruth schafer fleisher, shirley kruse, and bee haydu. some are with us, and some are no longer with us. some are not in great shape because they served in world war ii. it is happening throughout our nation where we see our finest passing away. in this time of great challenges to women, those women that you have there before us, they pushed beyond the boundaries. they brought new opportunities for women to come. my daughter-in-law, lindsay, she flew combat missions in iraq and afghanistan for the marines, but she would not have been able to do so without the women who came before her. just as you are a pioneer--to the gentlewoman i say thank you for your patriotic duty--but you stand also on their shoulders. these pioneers fought for the values of freedom and democracy. it is our duty to ensure that they are not denied the recognition for their service. we shouldn't be begging for this. with the valiant efforts of these american heroines, the united states and our allies were able to successfully defeat the axis powers during world war ii. i thank you, congresswoman mcsally, for introducing this important legislation that would make the women airforce service pilots eligible, once again, for the services in arlington national cemetery with full military honors. i agree with you that we don't need the legislation; that tonight, the secretary of the army could do the right thing, as he had done before, sign the order making this happen. we will continue the battle in their names. thank you so much to the gentlewoman. thank you for spearheading [[page h263]] this effort. thank you for taking this on. you are a valuable member of this institution. thank you for the time. ms. mcsally. i want to thank the gentlewoman from florida. as soon as i mentioned it to ileana, she was like: this is wrong. we have got to get involved. we have got to fix this. so i appreciate your strong advocacy before i got here, and your continued advocacy as a wingwoman in this cause. you know, for the wasps in this story and this cause, it is not just the right thing to do for the country. for me, it is also personal. these women opened the door for me to be able to be a pilot in the air force and, when the doors were opened, to transition to be a fighter pilot in the air force. i will be honest with you, i didn't hear about them when i was in high school. this is one reason why it is so important that we allow them to be laid to rest in arlington, so that it is part of the education for future generations. it wasn't until i went off to the air force academy that i actually learned about the wasps and learned about what they did. i just didn't even imagine that we would have women military pilots in the 1940s in world war ii, but we did. i got to meet some of these amazing women when i first came to tucson to fly the a-10 warthog, started my training. there were several of them that lived in southern arizona, and i got to become friends with them, and they became mentors to me and encouragers to me. as the doors were opening up for us to transition into fighters, there was hardly anybody we could really look to who understood what it was like to be in challenging circumstances where you are the only woman. people have attitudes about whether you can or cannot or should or should not do what you are doing as an aviator. but these women understood that. they put up with the same biases and the same discrimination as they served. they flew in world war ii. as i was looking around for someone to have as a role model, these women were incredible friends to me and supporters and wingwomen to me. here is one picture i want to show you. this is ruth helm, one of the tucson residents who, sadly, made her final flight over the last year. this is when she was inducted into the arizona aviation hall of fame. this is a picture of the two of us in civilian clothes as she was inducted there. {time} 1945 these women paved the way for me, but they encouraged me. even at my most challenging times, when i was feeling discouraged, i would sit down with them, and they would just fire me up to live to fight and fly another day. despite the fact that they were told to leave the military after all they did, they still were proud. they didn't have a chip on their shoulder. they were grateful for the opportunities that they had. they laughed off some of the challenges that they went through. they just started encouraging me, ``come on, you can do it. we did it.'' i just was able to kind of get back in there and continue to push forward because of what they did before me to open up the doors for me. ms. jackson lee. will the gentlewoman yield? ms. mcsally. i yield to the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. obviously we share a compassion and passion for these wonderful women. we also serve on the committee on homeland security together. first of all, let me thank you for your service and thank you so very much for bringing this very important issue, this bipartisan issue to the floor of the house and certainly to your colleagues. i am looking forward to working with you on this issue. i just want to say that one of my greatest joys in the united states congress was the military war zones that i had the chance to go to, starting with the bosnian war. i came in in that timeframe and traveled to that area, kosovo and albania, and then, of course, iraq and afghanistan and certainly a number of other sites where issues of conflict were going on. there i saw a myriad of women who stood on the shoulders of these women, who are now in a variety of the branches, not just aviators or in the air force in particular, but they stood on the shoulders of these women. it gave me a sense of pride and duty to say to them, ``thank you.'' women are unique. many of them are mothers or sisters and daughters who are in the service, or they take care of children, or they are nurturers for someone else. we have a particular role, but yet they are in the military leaving their families. just coming in today, i read an article about the ranger who is from my constituency who just came out of ranger school and is from houston. i simply want to say, this is the right thing to do. every year--and i think you have joined us now as you have come to congress--we go on memorial day week to arlington and lay a wreath for women who died in the line of duty or in the service of their country. does anyone realize the numbers of women? we have been doing this now for more than a decade, and the women of the house join us. they do that because this is a valuable part of america's history. to the lady, the aviator that now, i wouldn't say languished, but is with her granddaughter, her ashes are with her granddaughter, i want to make a public commitment joining you to say that her ashes should be in a place where she can rest in peace. we should move this quickly. if it requires an independent action by the army, a reconsideration, i am sure none of us would be offended by the army rescinding this particular--how should i say it?--action. i just wanted to come and thank you. i want to thank my colleague susan davis and all of my colleagues who have been on the floor. i did not want to miss this opportunity. coming from texas, i think, as i walk down the streets of houston or travel throughout the state of texas, i see veterans and active duty everywhere. we are proud of that. in urban centers like houston, you would think not, but they are dominant there. just this past christmas, we had what we call toys for kids and honored veterans' families. this is an important mission, and i want to join you in this mission. we have gotten our assignment. we really need to work. i think the american people need to know that all of us will join together to honor either our veterans, our fallen soldiers, or those who were the pioneers who i know the story of, who stood when they were called and did not step away from duty, did not step away from the danger, did not step away from possible death as they pursued the cause of this country and to protect this country. i thank you for yielding to me. i am ready to roll up my sleeves. let's get busy. let's help find a resting place for this dear sister and servant of the nation. let's find a resting place going forward for all of those who have served this wonderful and great country. they deserve it. ms. mcsally. i thank the gentlewoman from texas for joining the conversation tonight, again, to continue to highlight this egregious action that was taken that is putting our heroes in a place, especially elaine harmon, right now, where she has nowhere to be able to rest in peace. the place that she wanted to be is denying her, even though her service and the criteria are very clear that she has earned that right. i really appreciate you joining this bipartisan mission. we are not going to rest until the mission is complete. i want to thank the gentlewoman for that. as i was mentioning, this isn't just the right thing to do, but this is personal for me. as i transitioned into fighters, these women, these pioneers who opened up the door for me to even have the opportunity to become a fighter pilot, they mentored me. they walked alongside me. they encouraged me. they gave me some perspectives from their own training and their own experiences. they made me laugh. they made me cry. they were friends who just paved the way for me. you think about the debates we have had in this body over the years. i mean, women couldn't be pilots again in the military until, the late 1970s or early 1980s, they finally opened up the door for women to be pilots. but they could only serve in noncombat roles. [[page h264]] when they had that debate, that didn't have to be theoretical or hypothetical. they had the example of these amazing women who did what they did in world war ii--again, over a thousand of them, under extraordinary circumstances, flying by themselves, often just trying to figure it out in bad weather and how they were going to land and dealing with emergencies and clearances and just doing what it took in order to get the mission done, get the plane where it needed to be, train the men to go off and fly in combat, tow the targets, do the simulated strafing runs, all the test piloting, everything, to include risking their lives. thirty-eight of them died. this is personal to me. these three women pictured in this photo-- dawn seymour, eleanor gunderson, and ruth helm--they are sitting in this photo in the front row of the change of command ceremony that i had where i took over command of an a-10 fighter squadron, which was an historic day for our country that we finally had a woman doing that. it was an historic day for me to be able to take command of a squadron. i invited them and asked them to sit in the front row. i honored them in my change of command speech because i wanted to make sure that everybody there knew that i only had the opportunities that i had in the military because they paved the way. these three women are personal friends of mine. two of them have since had their final flight. dawn seymour is still with us, but the other two have passed away. we have to keep their legacy going. we have to make sure the next generations know how they served with honor at a time when the country needed them. we have to make sure that elaine harmon and any of the other wasps who want to have their ashes in arlington cemetery are allowed to do that. let's be clear. the only reason these women were not considered active duty at the time was because of gender biases and discrimination against women. that is the only reason. had they been a man doing those jobs, they would have been active duty in the army air corps; they would have been discharged honorably; and under the current guidelines, they would have been eligible to have their ashes at arlington. the only reason they were not active duty at the time was because of gender discrimination. now this is 2016. it is time for that to stop. we thought it was over in 1977 when we finally retroactively gave them that veteran status. they were given those honorable discharges and the medals that they deserved from serving in world war ii. we opened up the door for them to have military honors and to be laid to rest in veteran cemeteries around the country. arlington cemetery opened up the doors to them finally--a little late, but in 2002. last march, without telling anybody, they quietly rescinded that. it was just the last slap of gender discrimination against these amazing pioneers. it needs to be overturned immediately. this is the right thing to do for elaine harmon and for the other women who are still living. there are about 100 of them who are still with us; and for the next generations who need to know about their service, they deserve to be laid to rest next to the other heroes who are there. the secretary of the army has all the authority he needs to let elaine harmon's ashes be in arlington. let's be clear. this does not take legislation. he has all the authority he needs to make that happen tonight. if he won't do it, the secretary of defense can. if he won't do it, then president obama can. we should not wait another day, mr. secretary, mr. president, before making the decision and calling on elaine harmon's family and saying, ``it is approved. elaine can rest in peace in arlington national cemetery,'' which is what she deserved and what she asked for. we should not be lingering another day. as we continue to call on the administration to do the right thing, we are not going to sit by idly. we have got our legislation introduced. we have got almost 80 cosponsors in the house. we have got a senate version of the bill that was introduced today, led by senator mikulski and senator ernst, also a bipartisan bill. we are going to continue to push this forward to make this right for our heroes, these women airforce service pilots, these wasps. it is the least that we could do for all they have done for us. the last thing i want to say before i close out is that this just seems to be a cruel irony and a cruel contradiction if you think about it. just last month, the pentagon announced that they are opening up, finally, all positions in the military to women. it has been a long road to get to that place. i have been a strong advocate for that happening for a very long time. we are a country that is about equal opportunity. we are a country that treats people as individuals. our foundations are based on not treating people as a class. we should always, and in the military as well, pick the best man for the job, even if it is a woman. it has been a long haul to get over our biases as a country about what we think women as a whole group could or should do in service to our military. gradually, positions have been opened. gradually, women have continued to show that, when called, they will serve valiantly and with honor. they will fight and they will die, if needed, for our freedoms and our liberty. at the time that the pentagon is opening up all positions to women in the military that they are qualified for, they are closing the doors to arlington for the pioneers who made that happen. that is a cruel hypocrisy and contradiction, and it needs to be made right tonight. so again, i call on the secretary of the army, secretary of defense, and the president--perhaps he could announce it in his speech tomorrow night--that one of the legacy things that we are going to do for our heroes, for our pioneers, for these amazing women, is to allow them to be laid to rest in arlington national cemetery. we owe it to them. they paved the way as trailblazers. we owe it to them to be able to rest alongside the other heroes and to be able to continue to educate the next generations about their legacy. all i will say to the wasps is: i have got your back. you had mine, and i have got yours now. it is the right thing to do. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",36048
CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgH275,CREC-2016-01-11,114,RADICAL ISLAMISTS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H275-H276] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RADICAL ISLAMISTS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for half the time remaining before 10 p.m. Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we have now learned that the administration is releasing or has released Muhammad al-Rahman al- Shamrani, a 40-year-old citizen of Saudi Arabia. He was transferred to Saudi Arabia on January 11, 2016. Apparently, The New York Times had gotten ahold of documents regarding--and this is from an October 2008 recommendation for the continued detention under the Department of Defense control for Guantanamo detainee, and then it gives the long number--it is Muhammad al-Rahman al-Shamrani. If you read what purports to be secret--I don't know how The New York Times got it--but you read over in his file that this Guantanamo detainee--that would be Mr. Shamrani--on 14 October 2007 stated: ``When I get out of here, I will go to Iraq and Afghanistan and will kill as many Americans as I can. Then I will come here and kill more Americans.'' He also stated: ``I love Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar, and if I ever get out of Guantanamo, I will go back to fight the Americans and kill as many as I can.'' The detainee stated he hated all Americans and will seek revenge if ever released from Guantanamo. The detainee said that, if he is released, he would again participate in jihad against the enemies of Muslims, to include the United States. The detainee is proud of what he has done, and he is willing to do anything to fight against the enemies of Muslims. The detainee stated he decided to become more religious because of his dislike of the U.S. and its citizens. So for those who have been confused about the rules of civilized warfare, there is nothing illegal, unconstitutional against the Geneva Convention for holding people who are part of a group who are at war with your country until the group they are a part of announces they are no longer at war with you. Now, war was declared, as some of my Muslim leader friends in the Middle East and Africa tell me. It is obvious to the rest of the world that radical Islam declared war on the United States back in '79 after President Carter laid the foundation to allow what he called a man of peace to come in and take over ruling Iran. His name was Khomeini. It was after that that our American Embassy was attacked and over 50 people taken hostages, Americans. Basically, we did nothing about it. So I know the President likes to say that Guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool, but the fact is, oh, basically, if we get rid of Guantanamo, then that pretty much eliminates anger at America. The fact is that while President Clinton was sending American military to protect Muslims who were being unfairly treated, there were not only attacks against Americans. There was planning going on, not only to attack the USS Cole, but to attack America, our facilities, our embassies, our buildings, and they were planning 9/11. There were no detainees at Guantanamo. Yet, all of this plotting and planning--and from my discussions with people in the Middle East when I have been over there, with people who are from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, when I have been in those countries--I haven't been into Syria, but I have been right there at its border--but they all say the same thing. What they use to recruit is in 1979 we were attacked by radical Islamists. We did nothing under President Carter. In '83, we were attacked and around 300 marines were killed in Beirut. Congress, under Democratic control, said we are getting our people out. So President Reagan ordered the evacuation from Beirut. Instead of fighting back, we ran home. I understand that Reagan felt that was one of the big mistakes of his Presidency. So the attacks have been ongoing. The World Trade Center attack in 1993, the attack on the Khobar Towers, so many attacks under President Clinton. He sent a lot of tow missiles, blew up some tents. It seems maybe like there was an aspirin factory. It was not Guantanamo that was the driving force in all of those years, decades of war against the United States. It didn't exist. The elimination of Guantanamo will not end the animosity and the desire of radical Islamists to eliminate America from the map along with Israel. {time} 2130 And just to be clear, today the story from Susannah George, ``Islamic State Claims Responsibility for Baghdad Mall Attack,'' they are still at war. Whether they are JV or not, they are killing people. Adam Kredo from the Free Beacon reports today, ``Obama Administration Stonewalling Investigation into 113 Terrorists Inside United States'': ``Senators Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions disclosed Monday that they had been pressuring the Obama administration for months to disclose the immigration [[Page H276]] histories of these foreign-born individuals implicated in terror plots.'' Senators Cruz and Sessions wrote to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security and the Attorney General: ``The American people are entitled to information on the immigration history of terrorists seeking to harm them.'' They note that we already knew 14 of the people that were brought over as refugees turned out to be terrorists, foreign terrorists, radical Islamists, but they were given legal entrance as refugees. We have a right to know how many of those 113 that have now been arrested for terrorism were foreign born, how many of them came in as refugees. These are all important. Then we see the story from yesterday by Jonah Bennett that almost half of California driver's licenses went to illegal immigrants in 2015. Wow. Under the REAL ID Act, that means nobody from California should be able to use their driver's licenses to get on airplanes to travel in interstate commerce or foreign travel. And then the story from Philadelphia, January 8, absolutely tragic. A man walks up shooting police. A discussion today that there may be other people that were involved. The gunman said he shot the Philadelphia officer for the Islamic State. The police have said that. However, despite the fact that this radical Islamic terrorist has said he shot the police officer repeatedly in an ambush for Allah and for the Islamic State, here is the headline from a story by Dave Boyer from today: ``Obama Administration Wondering whether Shooting of Philly Cop Was Terrorist Act,'' because they don't take the radical Islamist terrorist who shot the policeman for Allah and for the Islamic State. Perhaps they think he is confused. He doesn't sound confused. He sounds like he knew exactly what he was doing when he walked up and ambushed, trying to kill by repeatedly shooting a Philadelphia policeman. The story of January 8 from Jay Solomon in The Wall Street Journal, ``Nuclear Deal Fuels Iran's Hard-Liners,'' and it makes clear, as it says down here: ``As much as $100 billion in frozen revenues are expected to return to Iran after sanctions are lifted, which U.S. officials said could happen in coming weeks. The White House hoped the cash windfall would aid Mr. Rouhani's political fortunes.'' Madam Speaker, mark my words. If that $100 billion to $150 billion is provided by this administration here in the United States of America to Iran, to its current radical Islamic leaders who hate the United States, who have not signed the deal that President Obama is so proud of--and they have breached it repeatedly already, we know--that money, some of that money will be used to finance the killing of Americans and Israelis. Now, back when I was a judge--years and years ago, a prosecutor--we would say, if you fund somebody who says they are going to use some of that money, as Iran has, to fund Hamas and Hezbollah, which we know are terrorist organizations, been named as such, and you know they are terrorist organizations, you know the money you are providing is going to, in turn, be provided to terrorist organizations. See, back when I was a prosecutor or judge, we would say: You know what? If you are knowingly providing money to someone who has already said they are going to give it to terrorists who are going to kill people, well, it sounds like there is a case to be made for you being as guilty as they are. Certainly, it goes beyond the pale of gross negligence, but that is hypothetically speaking. I am not a prosecutor. I am not a judge. I am not a chief justice anymore. But when is the sanity going to return when people who say they are your enemies who want death to America, continue to say ``death to America,'' continue to say we are going to provide more money, once you give us that $100 billion, $150 billion, once you give us that, we are going to fund more terrorism, and it is already being reported. Just the announcement that the money is coming has already stimulated more attacks on those who would hope to be free in Iran. It is tragic, just tragic. But, in any event, we are living in perilous times. Many understand that there are radical Islamists who are at war with us. It is time to recognize that the release of a man who has said he wants to kill Americans and will after he is released should be taken at his word. I know there is some claim that he may not have said the things that are attributed to him by our own officers, our own personnel that were monitoring him, but let me just say that is a real easy one. There is video somewhere, unless that has been lost with some of the emails that were being pursued by Congress. Unless it has been lost with emails that have been deleted to try to avoid turning them over to Congress, those videos can be consulted, and we can know for sure whether this Islamic radical that President Obama has released from Guantanamo said the things that our people said he said. I was hearing some of my friends' comments about the gun laws. I know we all share the desire to lessen and eliminate gun violence in America. The thousands of felony cases that came through my court caused me repeatedly to think back. I don't recall anybody who committed a crime with a gun that got it legally. Outlaws don't get guns legally. It has been made clear that the things our President has proposed would not have stopped one of these mass murderers that he now says spur him on to take action. I would encourage my friends: Let's work to take action that will actually stop the mass murders, that will actually stop the gun violence, but that will not occur by taking guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H275-H276] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RADICAL ISLAMISTS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock).

If that $100 billion to $150 billion is provided by this administration here in the United States of America to Iran, to its current radical Islamic leaders who hate the United States, who have not signed the deal that President Obama is so proud of--and they have breached it repeatedly already, we know--that money, some of that money will be used to finance the killing of Americans and Israelis. Now, back when I was a judge--years and years ago, a prosecutor--we would say, if you fund somebody who says they are going to use some of that money, as Iran has, to fund Hamas and Hezbollah, which we know are terrorist organizations, been named as such, and you know they are terrorist organizations, you know the money you are providing is going to, in turn, be provided to terrorist organizations. See, back when I was a prosecutor or judge, we would say: You know what? If you are knowingly providing money to someone who has already said they are going to give it to terrorists who are going to kill people, well, it sounds like there is a case to be made for you being as guilty as they are. Certainly, it goes beyond the pale of gross negligence, but that is hypothetically speaking. I am not a prosecutor. I am not a judge. I am not a chief justice anymore. But when is the sanity going to return when people who say they are your enemies who want death to America, continue to say ``death to America,'' continue to say we are going to provide more money, once you give us that $100 billion, $150 billion, once you give us that, we are going to fund more terrorism, and it is already being reported. Just the announcement that the money is coming has already stimulated more attacks on those who would hope to be free in Iran. It is tragic, just tragic. But, in any event, we are living in perilous times. Many understand that there are radical Islamists who are at war with us. It is time to recognize that the release of a man who has said he wants to kill Americans and will after he is released should be taken at his word. I know there is some claim that he may not have said the things that are attributed to him by our own officers, our own personnel that were monitoring him, but let me just say that is a real easy one. There is video somewhere, unless that has been lost with some of the emails that were being pursued by Congress. Unless it has been lost with emails that have been deleted to try to avoid turning them over to Congress, those videos can be consulted, and we can know for sure whether this Islamic radical that President Obama has released from Guantanamo said the things that our people said he said. I was hearing some of my friends' comments about the gun laws. I know we all share the desire to lessen and eliminate gun violence in America. The thousands of felony cases that came through my court caused me repeatedly to think back. I don't recall anybody who committed a crime with a gun that got it legally. Outlaws don't get guns legally. It has been made clear that the things our President has proposed would not have stopped one of these mass murderers that he now says spur him on to take action. I would encourage my friends: Let's work to take action that will actually stop the mass murders, that will actually stop the gun violence, but that will not occur by taking guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_238.csv,10797,10797,10865,"[congressional record volume 162, number 6 (monday, january 11, 2016)] [house] [pages h275-h276] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] radical islamists the speaker pro tempore (mrs. comstock). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) for half the time remaining before 10 p.m. mr. gohmert. madam speaker, we have now learned that the administration is releasing or has released muhammad al-rahman al- shamrani, a 40-year-old citizen of saudi arabia. he was transferred to saudi arabia on january 11, 2016. apparently, the new york times had gotten ahold of documents regarding--and this is from an october 2008 recommendation for the continued detention under the department of defense control for guantanamo detainee, and then it gives the long number--it is muhammad al-rahman al-shamrani. if you read what purports to be secret--i don't know how the new york times got it--but you read over in his file that this guantanamo detainee--that would be mr. shamrani--on 14 october 2007 stated: ``when i get out of here, i will go to iraq and afghanistan and will kill as many americans as i can. then i will come here and kill more americans.'' he also stated: ``i love osama bin laden and mullah omar, and if i ever get out of guantanamo, i will go back to fight the americans and kill as many as i can.'' the detainee stated he hated all americans and will seek revenge if ever released from guantanamo. the detainee said that, if he is released, he would again participate in jihad against the enemies of muslims, to include the united states. the detainee is proud of what he has done, and he is willing to do anything to fight against the enemies of muslims. the detainee stated he decided to become more religious because of his dislike of the u.s. and its citizens. so for those who have been confused about the rules of civilized warfare, there is nothing illegal, unconstitutional against the geneva convention for holding people who are part of a group who are at war with your country until the group they are a part of announces they are no longer at war with you. now, war was declared, as some of my muslim leader friends in the middle east and africa tell me. it is obvious to the rest of the world that radical islam declared war on the united states back in '79 after president carter laid the foundation to allow what he called a man of peace to come in and take over ruling iran. his name was khomeini. it was after that that our american embassy was attacked and over 50 people taken hostages, americans. basically, we did nothing about it. so i know the president likes to say that guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool, but the fact is, oh, basically, if we get rid of guantanamo, then that pretty much eliminates anger at america. the fact is that while president clinton was sending american military to protect muslims who were being unfairly treated, there were not only attacks against americans. there was planning going on, not only to attack the uss cole, but to attack america, our facilities, our embassies, our buildings, and they were planning 9/11. there were no detainees at guantanamo. yet, all of this plotting and planning--and from my discussions with people in the middle east when i have been over there, with people who are from iran, iraq, syria, lebanon, when i have been in those countries--i haven't been into syria, but i have been right there at its border--but they all say the same thing. what they use to recruit is in 1979 we were attacked by radical islamists. we did nothing under president carter. in '83, we were attacked and around 300 marines were killed in beirut. congress, under democratic control, said we are getting our people out. so president reagan ordered the evacuation from beirut. instead of fighting back, we ran home. i understand that reagan felt that was one of the big mistakes of his presidency. so the attacks have been ongoing. the world trade center attack in 1993, the attack on the khobar towers, so many attacks under president clinton. he sent a lot of tow missiles, blew up some tents. it seems maybe like there was an aspirin factory. it was not guantanamo that was the driving force in all of those years, decades of war against the united states. it didn't exist. the elimination of guantanamo will not end the animosity and the desire of radical islamists to eliminate america from the map along with israel. {time} 2130 and just to be clear, today the story from susannah george, ``islamic state claims responsibility for baghdad mall attack,'' they are still at war. whether they are jv or not, they are killing people. adam kredo from the free beacon reports today, ``obama administration stonewalling investigation into 113 terrorists inside united states'': ``senators ted cruz and jeff sessions disclosed monday that they had been pressuring the obama administration for months to disclose the immigration [[page h276]] histories of these foreign-born individuals implicated in terror plots.'' senators cruz and sessions wrote to the secretaries of state and homeland security and the attorney general: ``the american people are entitled to information on the immigration history of terrorists seeking to harm them.'' they note that we already knew 14 of the people that were brought over as refugees turned out to be terrorists, foreign terrorists, radical islamists, but they were given legal entrance as refugees. we have a right to know how many of those 113 that have now been arrested for terrorism were foreign born, how many of them came in as refugees. these are all important. then we see the story from yesterday by jonah bennett that almost half of california driver's licenses went to illegal immigrants in 2015. wow. under the real id act, that means nobody from california should be able to use their driver's licenses to get on airplanes to travel in interstate commerce or foreign travel. and then the story from philadelphia, january 8, absolutely tragic. a man walks up shooting police. a discussion today that there may be other people that were involved. the gunman said he shot the philadelphia officer for the islamic state. the police have said that. however, despite the fact that this radical islamic terrorist has said he shot the police officer repeatedly in an ambush for allah and for the islamic state, here is the headline from a story by dave boyer from today: ``obama administration wondering whether shooting of philly cop was terrorist act,'' because they don't take the radical islamist terrorist who shot the policeman for allah and for the islamic state. perhaps they think he is confused. he doesn't sound confused. he sounds like he knew exactly what he was doing when he walked up and ambushed, trying to kill by repeatedly shooting a philadelphia policeman. the story of january 8 from jay solomon in the wall street journal, ``nuclear deal fuels iran's hard-liners,'' and it makes clear, as it says down here: ``as much as $100 billion in frozen revenues are expected to return to iran after sanctions are lifted, which u.s. officials said could happen in coming weeks. the white house hoped the cash windfall would aid mr. rouhani's political fortunes.'' madam speaker, mark my words. if that $100 billion to $150 billion is provided by

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgH267,CREC-2016-01-11,114,CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H267-H275] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of this discussion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to rise today and to co-anchor, along with my distinguished colleague from the great State of Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, this CBC Special Order hour, this hour of power. Once again, we are privileged to take to the floor of the people's House to discuss an issue that should be relevant to every Member of this institution on behalf of the 320 million-plus Americans that we represent in this great country, and that is the gun violence epidemic. America has 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns. It is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns in circulation throughout this country. So it seems to me reasonable that we would do everything possible to ensure that not a single one of those guns finds themselves in the hands of individuals who would do us harm. And that in many ways is what President Obama has done as it relates to his most recent executive action. So today members of the Congressional Black Caucus will come to the House floor to discuss those executive actions, discuss the issue of gun violence, discuss the steps that we should be taking, here in this Chamber, in order to keep the people of America that we all collectively represent safe. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my classmate and my co-anchor for this CBC Special Order hour. I look forward to anchoring with her throughout the entire year. She has been a tremendous champion for working families, for the middle class, for small-business owners and, of course, for the young people who are ravaged in our communities all across this country by gun violence. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening proud to stand with my Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour co-anchor, Congressman Jeffries, from the Eighth Congressional District of New York. Mr. Jeffries, it is my honor to stand here today as we undertake an urgent dialogue on how we, as elected Representatives of the people, can work together to end gun violence. I look forward to engaging with Congressman Jeffries and our Congressional Black Caucus colleagues in scholarly debate on the issues plaguing African Americans, African American communities, and to develop solutions to the problems our constituents face. As the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus will remain on the forefront of issues that affect Black Americans in particular, and the Nation, in general. For tonight, our anchor, Congressman Jeffries, has pointed out the CBC will continue to shed light on the epidemic of gun violence, standing our ground, ending gun violence in America. Mr. Speaker, last week we opened the Second Session of the 114th Congress. Four hundred thirty-five of us traveled back to Washington ready to serve our constituents and work for the betterment of our Nation. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, whatever spirit of bipartisanship may have been present at the end of 2015 as Republicans and Democrats worked together on key pieces of legislation has disappeared at the precise time our Nation is calling on Congress to pass commonsense legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. We find ourselves confronted with startling statistics that no Nation should endure. Let me just take a moment to share just a few. We know that the impact of gun violence affects every community and every congressional district. However, African American children and teens are 17 times more likely to die from gun homicide than White youth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While African Americans make up 15 percent of youth in America, African Americans accounted for 45 percent of children and teen gun deaths in 2010. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, 88 Americans die every day from gun violence, Mr. Speaker. Roughly 50 percent of those killed are African American men, who comprise just 6 percent of the population. Homicide is the primary cause of death among African Americans ages 15- 24. Mr. Speaker, these numbers should be unthinkable, unimaginable, but they are the unfortunate reality in which African American communities live. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, whose legacy we honor next Monday, he said: We find ourselves ``confronted with the fierce urgency of now.'' And Mr. Speaker, it is now that our Nation is in an urgent crisis, yet we are trapped in congressional inaction. Shameful. So our President decided he would not stand by idly while Congress did nothing to prevent another Newtown, another Charleston, other Tucson. With tears in his eyes, he reflected on the senseless killings caused by gun violence over the course of his administration. President Obama announced new executive actions to confront the epidemic of gun violence in America. While mocked by some Republicans for showing emotion at the loss of so many lives, I am here to say I proudly stand with my President on the actions he has taken to prevent gun violence in America. These executive actions will save lives and make the country safer without infringing on law-abiding individuals' rights to firearms. You will hear from our colleagues tonight talking about the President's actions. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and to address gun violence. Mr. JEFFRIES. Thank you, Representative Beatty, for laying out the case in such an eloquent and compelling fashion, and pointing out that, with respect to gun safety and gun violence prevention in America, it is long past time when we act with the fierce urgency of now. Tens of thousands of Americans have died as a result of gun violence since the moment you and I first set foot in this institution, and not a single thing has been done by the House of Representatives to prevent those deaths. That is shameful, as you have pointed out, and we need a change of course. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member, lead Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, once, of course, chaired by the legendary Adam Clayton Powell, and Representative Scott has continued in that tremendous visionary tradition. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing tonight's Special Order to focus on the toll that gun violence has taken on communities across America and, especially, the disproportionate impact it has had within communities of color. Tonight's conversation comes at an important time. On average, every day more than 30 people are killed by firearms, many in mass murders. Now, rather than do what they say is celebrate the problem, I want to talk about solutions. Last Tuesday, the President announced the executive actions that his administration will take [[Page H268]] to prevent gun violence. I commend the President for taking this action, in light of the current congressional leadership's refusal to responsibly address this epidemic. These executive actions will ensure stronger enforcement of current laws and will reduce the number of lives lost to gun violence. To begin with, the President's executive actions will narrow the ``gun show'' and Internet loopholes by actually enforcing licensing requirements for gun dealers and overhauling the background check system to make it more effective and efficient. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform criminal background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be ``engaged in the business'' of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the ATF. The executive actions make it clear that the commonsense proposition that anyone making a profit from the sale of guns, or who regularly makes gun sales or earns a livelihood from gun sales, is, in fact, engaged in the business and therefore must obtain a license and conduct required criminal background checks, even if those sales occur at gun shows or over the Internet. {time} 2030 The question of whether someone is engaged in business will be determined by normal legal standards as opposed to people just declaring themselves to be exempt, which is going on now. Some of these people are even making a living selling firearms. They need to get a license. This is the present law, and the President has said that he will enforce it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, as part of executive actions, will overhaul its National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the NICS system, to make it more effective and efficient by hiring more than 230 additional examiners and other staff so that the Bureau can process background checks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and improve its notification of local authorities when prohibited persons unlawfully attempt to purchase a gun. These people are currently breaking the law when they illegally try to buy a firearm, and local law enforcement officials need to be informed. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, this system has already caught more than 2 million people trying to buy guns illegally, and they need to be held accountable for breaking the law. Furthermore, dealers will also be required to notify law enforcement if their guns are lost or stolen in transit. This transparency and accountability will ensure that law enforcement will be notified and can begin investigations when these losses occur. Executive actions will also leverage the buying power of the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun technology. When the Federal Government begins buying guns using that kind of technology, it will make it more likely that this technology will be used. There is technology that makes it impossible for anyone other than the true owner to use weapons, and the more purchases the Federal Government makes, the more likely it is that technology will actually be installed in future weapons. The President has also directed the departments to review the availability of smart gun technology on a regular basis and to explore potential ways to further its use and to encourage research to more broadly improve gun safety. The President's plan also proposes a new $500 million investment to increase access to mental health treatment to ensure that people who need help do not fall through the cracks of the mental health system. This is in addition to the huge increases in mental health funding under the Affordable Care Act. Mental health services are considered essential services, and so now virtually all health insurance policies include mental health coverage. While modest and within the President's executive authority, these executive actions will go a long way in keeping guns out of the hands of people who never should be able to purchase them in the first place. But that is executive action. Congress needs to act so that more can be done to actually protect citizens from gun violence. The House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force has consistently reiterated that Washington has a moral obligation to do something to address our Nation's gun violence epidemic. The most effective way to address this epidemic is through comprehensive, evidence-based policy proposals. Our task force has put forth several proposals that will go a long way in achieving these goals. These proposals include reinstating and strengthening the assault weapon ban, reducing the size of magazines, implementing universal background checks, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and straw purchases, improving our mental health system, and implementing comprehensive, locally tailored, evidence-based violence prevention and intervention programs. The gentleman from California, Representative Mike Thompson, is the chair of the House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and he has introduced a resolution to establish a select committee of the House to study gun violence. That resolution is cosponsored by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and 11 cochairs of the task force. The proposed select committee would be comprised of six Republicans and six Democrats who would study the research and issue a final report and recommendations, including legislative proposals, within 60 days of its establishment. It would study and make recommendations to address many issues, including the causes of mass shootings, methods to improve the Federal firearms purchaser background check system, connections between access to firearms and dangerously mentally ill individuals, Federal penalties for trafficking and straw purchasing of firearms, loopholes that allow some domestic abusers continued access to firearms, linkages between firearms and suicide, gun violence's effect on public health, the correlation between State gun violence prevention laws and the incidence of gun violence, the importance of having reliable, accurate information on gun violence and its toll on our Nation, the implementation of effective gun violence prevention laws in accordance with the Second Amendment to our Constitution, and the rates of gun violence in large metropolitan areas. Mr. Speaker, by taking a deliberate, research-based approach to gun violence, treating it as we would a public health challenge, we can significantly reduce the ravages of gun violence. The President is limited by his executive authority on what alone he can do to address this epidemic. Long-term reforms can only be achieved through congressional action. I hope that the leadership of the Congress will follow the President's lead and act in a bipartisan basis to address this critical issue using public health strategies and evidence-based proposals. Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlelady from Ohio for coordinating this Special Order. Mr. JEFFRIES. Thank you, Representative Scott, for laying out the steps that are being taken by the President in such a compelling way in explaining why they are items that we should all support as well as some of the steps that need to be taken legislatively by this Congress in order to deal with the fact that more than 10,000 Americans a year die as a result of gun violence-related homicides. I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). She is an incredibly eloquent and passionate voice for the voiceless. We appreciate her service here in the Congress not just on behalf of the district that she represents in northern California, but certainly on behalf of the people of the United States of America. I yield now to Congresswoman Barbara Lee. Ms. LEE. First, let me thank the gentleman from New York for those very kind remarks. But also I want to thank you and Congresswoman Beatty for organizing this very important Special Order and for your tremendous leadership, Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty, on ensuring public safety. Your leadership, both Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman [[Page H269]] Jeffries, has been bold, it has been visionary, not just as the result of the very recent tragedies but for many, many years even before both of you came to Congress. So it is an honor serving with both of you in this body. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening. Also, I want to just thank Congresswoman Robin Kelly, who is the vice chair on the Gun Violence Task Force. She also chairs the CBC's Health Braintrust. I thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem, which it is. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to call on Congress to do something--to do something--about the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities. Since the start of the year--just 11 days ago--nine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence, including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller. Just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides. My thoughts are with the victims' family at this very terribly difficult time. We have to do something. Enough is enough. Congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence. Whether it is Charleston, Oak Creek, Sandy Hook, the streets of Oakland or wherever, too many people have already lost their lives, too many families have buried loved ones, and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence. Madam Speaker, now is the time for action. Our constituents are demanding action. The country is demanding action. I have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents, and I know other Members are also hearing from their constituents. They are calling for action as well. Earlier today in my own District, Oakland City Council President Lynette Gibson McElehany buried her grandson, 17-year-old Torian Hughes, who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before Christmas. This has been a very difficult period for Council Member McElehany and her family. So in addition to our prayers not only for my council member's family, but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence, we must do something. We must do something in all of their memory. Let me be clear. Congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents, their families, and communities. Last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of Americans in applauding President Obama's actions to reduce gun violence in our Nation. Thanks to the President's leadership, there will be more background checks, better enforcement of existing gun laws, improved mental health services, and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence. But more action is needed to stop the more than 30,000 gun deaths that occur in our Nation each and every year. Congress must pass commonsense gun reform, like closing the gun show loophole, bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of Americans and gun owners. Congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services. But this should not be an excuse, of course, to do nothing on gun safety. We have got to provide the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives the resources it needs to enforce our Nation's gun laws. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe. We must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcement's ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue. That is why I introduced last year H.R. 1449, the Tiahrt Restrictions Repeal Act, which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks. These data restrictions are commonly called the Tiahrt restrictions. They prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public. These provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the National Criminal Background Check System records to be destroyed--mind you, destroyed--within 24 hours, prohibiting the ATF from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and State law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers. This is outrageous. We have got to restrict and repeal these Tiahrt amendments right away. It will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals. It is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes. The Tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers, law enforcement, and Federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community. Of course, many of us are proud to support Congresswoman Kelly's bill, which would allow the Surgeon General to study gun violence as a public health issue and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to regulate firearms. Madam Speaker, the time for action is now. Let's start listening to the American people and insist that Congress do something. It is really disingenuous to criticize the President for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this body--for years--to get these sensible bills passed. The Speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that Congress can act. No more excuses. We should support Congressman Thompson's proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence. The Speaker should do this now. So we can't continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about Congress. We need to do our job. We have been trying, many of us, the Congressional Black Caucus and others, especially Democrats, for many years to try to get the Speaker to bring these bills to the floor. So what did the President do? He had to do something. But no more excuses. Congress needs to act. So I thank Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries for this very important Special Order hour and for your tremendous leadership. Mr. JEFFRIES. Again, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California for her wonderful remarks, observations, and, of course, her support for the President's executive actions on gun safety, making it clear that the President was left with no choice but to act. Tens of thousands of Americans die each and every year either as it relates to homicide or suicide through a firearm, and nothing was happening here in the United States Congress. The classic definition of legislative insanity is to do the same exact thing, which in this instance is nothing, and expect that things were going to change for the safety and the well-being of the American people. That is why we are here on the floor today expressing strong support for the President's executive actions and pushing this institution to do more and finish the job that the President of the United States of America started. {time} 2045 It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Houston (Ms. Jackson Lee), a forceful advocate and the lead Democrat on the relevant committee on the House Judiciary side of the equation as it relates to criminal justice, reform, and gun safety. She, of course, has been a tremendous champion for the people that she serves down in H-Town, as well as across the country. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. As has been stated by my colleagues, I want to add my applause as well for the thoughtfulness of the gentleman's leadership on a number of issues, but certainly on his pronounced leadership on criminal justice reform and on the Judiciary Committee; and then to be joined by former leader of the Ohio State Legislature--and she has not forgotten her talents of leadership--and that is Congresswoman Joyce Beatty who joins us, if I might put words in both your mouths, with a sense of outrage about where we are today. I say that because I would like to stand here [[Page H270]] with an enormous amount of outrage for where we are and why we are here. I want to add my appreciation to the Congressional Black Caucus, the chairman, Mr. Butterfield, and, of course, Congresswoman Dr. Kelly, who has been a great leader on the issues dealing with health care. I just want to cite to her, a lady that came to this Congress more than a decade ago, Deborah Prothrow-Stith. You may have read her writings. She pronounced during that time that gun violence was a health crisis. That was so many years ago. Unfortunately, with all of her expert writings, we still couldn't get movement. I am going to take a slightly different perspective. If I could just take these few moments to give you an anecdotal story, which many of you might find absolutely with a great deal of shock, if you will. That is the limit to which gun rights advocates mislead the American people on any ideas for gun safety or gun regulation as taking guns away. I was in a meeting where someone was trying to understand why President Obama in his excellent presentation about securing America and protecting our children from gun violence was being associated with the idea of taking over 345 million guns. This is what is represented to be President Obama's message. He will confiscate, through his process of gun testing or making sure that there are background checks for everyone, that he wants to confiscate 345 million guns, which has been determined to be located in 65 million places here in the United States. Can I, in a public forum on this august floor of the House, say that we, as Members of Congress--and I think Republicans will admit this-- have no evidence, no documentation, that the White House intends to confiscate guns--no manner of level of increased ATF officers could ever do that--why this mischaracterization is here. But listen to this. Gun rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the years that the Second Amendment they interpret means that they can buy any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. Well, basically, that does exist, except for the basic constraint of background checks, which now the President has expanded to ensure that if you are in a gun show--this is a gun show loophole--and you are sitting next to the stall of a licensed gun person and you are in the business of selling guns, why shouldn't you be either licensed or require, basically, background checks? But listen to this. In an ongoing legal battle in Florida, they lay claim to a newfangled Second Amendment right: the right not to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. Specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing guns or the potential harms that guns may cause with their patients. While mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the Constitution is on their side. Last month, for the third time in the same suit, a Federal court of appeals agreed. This is very bizarre. The case is filed under the name of Wollschlaeger v. Governor of the State of Florida, although First and Second Amendment buffs may recognize it under the cutesy nickname Docs v. Glocks. It started when some gun owners and the National Rifle Association told Florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking about gun safety--by asking about gun safety. The legislators responded by passing a law that bars healthcare workers from discussing or recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. Twelve other States are thinking about it, and now we have the Privacy of Firearm Owners Act. This is in the face of a number of homicides in this country. Let me cite to my colleagues that America is the number one country out of Western nations that has the highest number of cases of homicide by firearm per 100,000. The closest that comes to them is 0.7 by Italy. Then Taiwan, Canada, and Spain, 0.2; Germany, 0.2. All the news stories that we see on violent disruptions in various places and protests, their numbers of gun violence, of homicides, is miniscule: Australia, 0.1; UK, 0.1; France, 0.1; South Korea, 0.03; and finally Japan, 0.01. If that doesn't get our attention, I don't know what does. Then look at this map; 353 mass shootings in America in 2015. My colleague can see, is this anything to be proud of? Mass shootings not by knives, not by throwing stones, but by guns. This is what America is to the world: a sea of red of mass shootings, so much so that you can't even see background in some of the parts of this Nation. Yet there are laws that are being passed to stop health professionals from asking whether you have guns that might, in fact, endanger your children or yourselves. On average, more than 100,000 people in the United States are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes. More than 32,000 people die from gun violence, including 2,677 children under the age of 18. Gun deaths, justified versus criminal: studies also found that for every 1 justified homicide in the United States involving a gun, guns were used in 44 criminal homicides. In all of our communities, we see young Black men being felled by gun violence, young people in our communities being felled by gun violence, or innocent storekeepers being felled by gun violence, or in the instance of the Philadelphia police officer. All of us respect the dangers of law enforcement, recognizing that we can work together by building prepared and trained law enforcement officers to avoid the violence with guns. But in the instance of this individual, who point-blank shot at an officer with a gun, who has now been determined possibly to have heard voices, though he said he was inspired by ISIS, again, someone wanted to suggest that it wasn't anything that Obama could have done. It was a stolen police gun and it is out on the streets. Obviously, we don't have enough people enforcing against the trafficking of stolen guns. Mass shootings. The U.S. has a far higher number of mass shootings than any others I have indicated. Mental health. Approximately one in four American adults have a mental illness. Every time we hear of these mass shootings, the defense comes, which they have a right, to talk about this person's severe criminal mental illness condition. Guns in suicide is the leading cause of related deaths in America. More than 60 percent of deaths by guns in the country are the result of individuals using these weapons intending to commit suicide--not knives, not stones, not even poison or an overdose on drugs--guns. Guns and domestic violence provide a deadly outcome. Law enforcement killed by guns: each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives in gun violence having been shot to death while protecting their communities. Of course, we know that we have experienced tragic incidences under the authority of law where people have been killed, and the community is over the top in frustration. Background checks save lives. The tragedy at Mother Emanuel is the individual went to buy guns and the store owner said it is taking too long. I support President Obama's very astute and thoughtful approach. Out of that, I am very glad to have introduced two initiatives. One, H.R. 4315, Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act, which is a capture of President Obama's, along with Karen Bass. I urge my colleagues to sign on to H.R. 4315, which authorizes $500 million for health treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health information to the FBI background check system, NICS--not to violate the privacy, but to give more information to the database, because that certainly would be part of saving lives. As I conclude, H.R. 4316, that I am pleased to have Congresswoman Kelly join me in this, the Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act, authorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents, the very point of which my Republican friends are saying, but yet they are condemning what the President has offered. I would say to my colleagues in closing, if we don't do this for any other reason, to take and codify the President's initiatives on NICS or data collection, on research regarding safer guns, on background checks or closing the gun show loophole, if we don't do it, we should do it for the children. [[Page H271]] From December 2012 to December 2013, at least 100 children were killed in unintentional shootings, almost two every week, 61 percent higher than Federal data reflect. About two-thirds of these unintended deaths, at 65 percent, took place in the home or vehicle that belonged to the victim's family, most often with the guns that were legally owned but not secured. I remind you of that Supreme Court challenge or that law in Florida where doctors can't secure information to protect the patients or the children of these families. More than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them. I have introduced legislation on gun storage--I call it safety and responsibility--but yet, unfortunately, it is perceived as attacking the Second Amendment. My good friend from New York (Mr. Jeffries), let me thank you for yielding. Allow me to just leave us with the point that, as the Congressional Black Caucus stands on the floor, we need partners in doing the right thing. I hope before the President leaves office, he will have the opportunity to reasonably and rationally sign bills that will save lives. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Ending Gun Violence in America. Gun violence in America can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified. We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act. Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: to protect and defend the American people. This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem gun violence in our nation. Yet, after another mass shooting and countless acts of gun violence in communities across our country every day, House Republicans are still unwilling to act to stop gun violence and save lives in American communities. The Democrats have been calling for an immediate vote on the bipartisan King-Thompson Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act to strengthen the life-saving background checks that keep guns out of the wrong hands. This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the gun violence epidemic. Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the lives of Americans by taking common sense steps to save lives. The Administration has announced two new executive actions that will help strengthen the federal background check system and keep guns out of the wrong hands. I have introduced two bills that will hopefully enhance these executive actions and support the President's recently announced action on gun violence. H.R. 4315--Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act-- authorizes $500 million for mental health treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health information to the FBI's background check system NICS. H.R. 4316--Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act--authorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents and investigators for enforcement of existing gun laws. The President included these specific requests in yesterday's announcements and these bills respond to those requests. Additionally, the Department of justice (DOJ) is proposing a regulation to clarify who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law for reasons related to mental health. And the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a proposed regulation to address barriers preventing states from submitting limited information on those persons to the federal background check system. Ending gun violence in America requires a comprehensive approach--we must come together and work towards this common goal. Too many Americans have been severely injured or lost their lives as a result of gun violence. While the vast majority of Americans who experience a mental illness are not violent. However, in some cases when persons with a mental illness does not receive the treatment they need, the result can be tragedies such as homicide or suicide. We must continue to address mental health issues by: Supporting expanded coverage of mental health services and enhanced training and hiring of mental health professionals; and Continuing the national conversation on mental health to reduce stigma associated with having a mental illness and getting help; and We must also continue to do everything we can to making sure that anyone who may pose a danger to themselves or others does not have access to a gun. The federal background check system is one of the most effective ways of assuring that such individuals are not able to purchase a firearm from a licensed gun dealer. To date, background checks have prevented over two million guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Administration's two new executive actions will help ensure that better and more reliable information makes its way into the background check system. The Administration, however, has acknowledged the need for collective action and continues to call upon Members of Congress to pass common- sense gun safety legislation and to expand funding to increase access to mental health services. I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that will help stop the loss of innocent lives. While we have made some progress in strengthening the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to run background checks on those who buy guns from federally licensed gun dealers to make sure they are not prohibited by law from owning a firearm, we must do more. I am a strong supporter of a right of privacy and I am particularly sensitive and protective of patient privacy rights. I support the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that was passed by Congress in 1996, and includes privacy protection for medical records, which includes mental healthcare information. However, there are specific areas under federal law that allow the disclosure of medical information to authorities, and in these instances there should be an agreement that when a person poses a threat to themselves or others (as determined by a court or adjudicative authority with the medical and legal knowledge and authority to make a determination that a person poses a threat to themselves or to others) should not be allowed to purchase a fire arm. Technology that could be deployed to access court records and arrest records as they relate to mental health and violent behavior should not rely upon a list that may become out dated or could be used in ways that are not consistent with the intent of enhancing gun safety. The ability to access information that is accurate and available for the limited purpose of affirming or rejecting a request to purchase a firearm without indicating the source of the decision or the reason for the rejection would still protect privacy rights while also protecting the public. The president's proposal on mental health and gun violence is to enforce the laws already in place. Under a federal law enacted in 1968, an individual is prohibited from buying or possessing firearms for life if he/she has been ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' or ``committed to a mental institution.'' A person is ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' if a court--or other entity having legal authority to make adjudications--has made a determination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) Is a danger to himself or to others; 2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs; 3) Is found insane by a court in a criminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A person is ``committed to a mental institution'' if that person has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or other lawful authority. This expressly excludes voluntary commitment. It should be noted, however, that federal law currently allows states to establish procedures for mentally ill individuals to restore their right to possess and purchase firearms (many states have done so at the behest of the National Rifle Association, with questionable results). It is undoubtedly true that people who are a danger to self and/or others because of mental illness should be prohibited from owning firearms. It is less clear, however, how to tailor new policies to better protect the American public while at the same time avoiding the stigmatization of Americans with mental illness. Any strategy to address the lethal intersection between guns and mental illness should focus on the key facts: On average, more than 100,000 people in America are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes. More than 32,000 people die from gun violence annually, including 2,677 children under the age of eighteen years old. Suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in America. 60 percent of deaths by guns in America are the result of individuals using these weapons as a means to commit suicide. [[Page H272]] Some of these deaths might have been prevented if there were adequate background checks. Each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives to gun violence been shot to death protecting their communities. Millions of guns are sold every year in ``no questions asked'' transactions and experts estimate that 40 percent of guns now sold in America are done so without a background check. National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was created in 1998 to require potential gun buyers to pass an instant screening at the point of purchase. Ensures that purchasers are not felons, domestic abusers, mentally ill, etc. NICS has blocked sales to more than 2 million prohibited people. NICS stops 170 felons and 53 domestic abusers from purchasing guns every day. The most serious issue facing NICS is the ``private sale loophole''. This allows anyone who is not a federally-licensed dealer to sell guns without a background check. An estimated 40% of gun transfers--6.6 million transfers--are conducted without a background check. Armslist.com is the largest online seller of firearms. 66,000 gun ads are posted by private sellers on a given day, 750,000 per year. Nearly 1/3rd of gun ads on Armslist.com are posted by high-volume unlicensed sellers (approx. 4,218 people). High-volume sellers posted 29% of the gun ads. High-volume sellers posted 36,069 gun ads over 2 months. This would equate to around 243,800 guns each year by unlicensed sellers. 50% were familiar with federal laws but decided they didn't apply to them. 1/3rd of ``want-to-buy'' ads are posted by people with a criminal record. More than 4 times the rate at which prohibited gun buyers try to buy guns in stores. Approximately 25,000 guns are in illegal hands. [From Slate, Jan. 8, 2016] The Absurd Logic Behind Florida's Docs vs. Glocks Law The Second Amendment trumps all other amendments (By Dahlia Lithwick and Sonja West) Gun-rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the years about the broad scope of their constitutional rights. They say, in effect, that the Second Amendment means they can buy virtually any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. But in an ongoing legal battle in Florida, they lay claim to a newfangled Second Amendment right--the right not to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. Specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing guns, or the potential harms those guns may cause, with their patients. And while mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the Constitution is on their side. Last month, for the third time in the same suit, a federal court of appeals agreed. This very bizarre case is filed under the name of Wollschlaeger v. Governor of the State of Florida, although First and Second amendment buffs may recognize it under the cutesy nickname Docs vs. Glocks. It started when some gun owners (and the National Rifle Association) told Florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking about gun safety. The legislators responded by passing a law that bars health care workers from discussing or recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. (Twelve other states have considered enacting similar legislation, but only Florida has actually passed such a law.) The result was the Firearms Owners' Privacy Act. The law provides that licensed health care practitioners and facilities: ``may not intentionally enter'' information concerning a patient's ownership of firearms into the patient's medical record that the practitioner knows is ``not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others,'' and ``shall respect a patient's right to privacy and should refrain'' from inquiring as to whether a patient or their family owns firearms, unless the practitioner or facility believes in good faith that the ``information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.'' Violations of the act could lead to disciplinary action including fines and suspension, or revocation of a medical license. Proponents of such laws say these doctor-patient dialogues violate the patients' Second Amendment rights. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for the tremendous work you continue to do on the Judiciary Committee. I look forward to partnering with you. As you point out, the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms. It should not protect the ability of others to utilize weapons, often of mass destruction, in doing harm to Americans without a license or any legal bases for doing so. All we want is rational gun safety and gun violence prevention. I look forward to continuing to work with you in that regard. It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), one of my classmates. She has been a tremendous and forceful advocate for gun violence prevention measures, not only as the chair of the CBC Health Braintrust, for which she has been tireless on so many different issues, but also in her capacity within the House Democratic Caucus, as well as a chair of the CBC Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, someone who stood up countless times for the children in Chicago and the many others who have been dealing with unacceptable levels of gun violence. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank my good friends, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for this important Special Order hour tonight. Congressman Jeffries, you have chaired these Special Order hours for the Congressional Black Caucus in my first term, so it is good to see you back in the driver's seat with our classmate, Representative Beatty. Last year, I had the privilege of leading the Special Order hour with our colleague, the Honorable Donald Payne of New Jersey. In the course of that year, we came to this floor to reflect on gun violence on one too many occasions because it is an epidemic in communities across the country. In fact, we are 11 days into 2016, and there have already been 80 shootings in my hometown of Chicago. Four people were shot and killed in less than 24 hours. I applaud President Obama's bold executive action that has been talked about tonight. I believe these policies will keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous individuals. If you listen to some, they will say they are trying to take our guns. There is nothing in the executive action that says that. The opposition is pushing fear, not fact. With over 30 Americans killed by guns every single day inaction is not an option. {time} 2100 In my nearly 3 years in Congress, the majority party has refused to do anything on gun violence--not one hearing, not a single vote. To right what Congress has, unfortunately, made wrong, President Obama did what was necessary to address the threat to our long-term national security and economic stability. While we can't stop every criminal from committing every crime, we can take actions that will save lives. While President Obama's executive actions are crucial steps in reducing the senseless gun violence that is plaguing our Nation, they do not absolve Congress of its moral responsibility to act. There are gaps in existing gun laws that leave us all vulnerable to gun violence. These holes are ones that only Congress can plug. I have two commonsense bills that will complement President Obama's executive actions and that will help bring a reduction in firearm mortality. The first bill, H.R. 224, the Recognizing Gun Violence as a Public Health Emergency Act, would require the Surgeon General to submit an annual report to Congress on the public health impact of gun violence. The bill currently has 135 cosponsors, and I hope that this commonsense proposal can get an up-or-down vote this year. Also, I recently introduced H.R. 225, the Firearm Safety Act, which would close the loophole which prevents the Consumer Product Safety Commission from creating rules regarding the safety of firearms. Quite simply, if the Consumer Product Safety Commission can regulate teddy bears, bicycle helmets, and car seats, it should be able to regulate firearms. Simply improving safety lock quality and improving storage safety will reduce accidents, misfires, and will prevent theft, saving thousands of lives. Senseless gun violence has been plaguing our Nation for far too long. It is simply unacceptable in the United States of America that gun violence is the leading cause of death for people under 24. It is time for us to come together to end the gun violence that is [[Page H273]] taking a generation of young Americans. I often ask: Just how many and just who has to die before we take action? I urge my colleagues to attend a funeral to see and to feel the hurt and loss. Your standing for moments of silence and then your sitting in silence does nothing to deal with this issue. Let's stop the hypocrisy and take action and save lives. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman, my good friend from Illinois, for the very powerful presentation and for her steadfast leadership. Madam Speaker, one of the reasons we believe that Members of Congress need to act is that State laws are so inconsistent from one jurisdiction to the other. In New York, we experience gun violence in certain communities at unprecedented levels notwithstanding the fact that we have tremendously significant and robust gun violence prevention measures in place. But the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in the Brooklyn communities, represented by me and Yvette Clarke, actually come from the neighboring States of Pennsylvania as well as up the I-95 corridor from States in the Deep South. Chicago, as Robin Kelly has indicated, has been experiencing unprecedented levels of gun violence. Illinois actually has pretty robust gun safety-gun violence prevention laws on the books, but the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in Chicago come from the neighboring States of Indiana and Wisconsin, which have lax laws. Out in south central Los Angeles, the situation has gotten better over the last decade or so. California has pretty strong gun safety-gun violence prevention laws. The overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in south central Los Angeles and in east LA actually come from the neighboring State of Arizona. That is why we need Congress to act in order to deal with what is a national problem. Madam Speaker, it is now my great honor and privilege to yield to my good friend and colleague, my sister from the neighboring congressional district of mine and who has been such a forceful advocate on behalf of the communities that she represents in Brooklyn, the distinguished gentlewoman from the Ninth Congressional District of New York, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Let me first start by thanking my brother from the neighboring district in Brooklyn, New York (Mr. Jeffries), alongside my sister from Ohio, Mrs. Joyce Beatty, for their leadership in our Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, discussing gun violence and gun safety measures. Let me also commend the Honorable Robin Kelly of Illinois for her leadership in doing the work that she is doing not only with our Health Braintrust, but by being an outspoken and forceful advocate for the end to gun violence not only for her district in Chicago, Illinois, but for all communities across this Nation. Madam Speaker, gun violence in the United States has reached epic proportions in the 21st century. The death, the trauma, the devastation that we are witnessing can no longer be tolerated. Congress must act now. Over the past decade in America, more than 100,000 people have been killed as a result of gun violence and millions more have been maimed by the reckless and unlawful discharging of firearms. I applaud President Barack Obama for taking this historic executive action to address gun violence in our Nation. These actions will save lives and will make America a safer place. The President's actions will strengthen lifesaving background checks, improve mental health services, and expand smart gun technology. We have all that we need in the United States to observe the Second Amendment rights of Americans and, at the same time, to take our Nation into the 21st century with responsible gun ownership that leaves little room for the illegal gun activity that we see taking place in terms of gun trafficking, in terms of the use of deadly arms in the hands of those who are unlicensed to hold them. As it relates to background checks, the proposals focus on new background check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the NICS, and the greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the State level. Specifically, it directs the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to obtain a Federal license to do so and to conduct background checks. It calls for the increased funding for the ATF in the hiring of 200 new ATF agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws, and it requires the ATF to issue a rule requiring background checks for the purchasers who purchase certain dangerous firearms and other items through a trust, a corporation, or other legal entity. It encourages greater communication between Federal and State authorities on criminal history information. What could be wrong with that? That is within the boundary of our laws, within our constitutional rights, and it makes our Nation safer. I come to this floor today as one who considers herself to be a victim of gun violence. We need to confront this right away because, for many in our communities, it is not only those who have been physically harmed by gun violence, but those who have been traumatized by being a witness to gun violence. I had the unfortunate privilege, if you will, of being in the Council Chambers of the New York City's City Council when my colleague, the Honorable James E. Davis, was gunned down before all of his colleagues--workplace domestic terrorism. That incident has been with me from that day forward. To this day, at a moment's notice, I can recall the trauma of that day, what it meant to see my colleague's life taken from him and to hear the gunplay that took place in the New York City Council's chambers. I am not alone. There are millions of Americans who are witnesses to gun violence or who may have been maimed by gun violence and who did not necessarily die as a result of it, but whose lives have been changed dramatically. We should not have another generation of Americans who can speak to the unspeakable horror of what it is to either be impacted directly in the loss of a loved one or to be the families who have to recount the times when they have had to be at the hospital with someone who is trying to recover from being gunned down. It is our obligation, our responsibility, as lawmakers for this Nation to get this right for future generations. So I applaud President Obama for doing what he could do within the parameters of his authority. It is now time for the United States House to do its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend and colleague for a very powerful presentation and for pointing out the sensibility of supporting all of the President's efforts, but particularly as they relate to the ATF, which is the Federal agency charged with enforcing our Nation's gun laws. Two hundred additional agents is the bare minimum that we can hire to make sure that the ATF has the manpower and resources necessary to prevent the illegal trafficking of guns into places like the Brownsville and East Flatbush neighborhoods that Congresswoman Yvette Clarke so passionately represents. If you block funding for the ATF, what you essentially are doing is supporting the efforts of the merchants of death who rely on underenforcement by the ATF, because of an absence of resources, in order to flood communities like Chicago; south central Los Angeles; parts of Brooklyn; Newark, New Jersey; and many other neighborhoods with illegal weapons. Madam Speaker, I yield to my good friend and colleague, Congressman Donald Payne. I thank him as well as R. Kelly. D. Payne and R. Kelly made a fantastic combination. We thank them for their distinguished service last year in leading the CBC Special Order hour. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PAYNE. Let me thank the gentleman from New York, who passed the baton to R. Kelly and me in 2015. We have rounded the corner and have put it back in his capable hands, along with our classmate's, the honorable [[Page H274]] gentlewoman from the great State of Ohio, Joyce Beatty, who is demonstrating day in and day out why she was such a great leader in the Ohio legislature. She has brought those talents to bear on the entire Nation. Madam Speaker, these are very serious times. I want to start out by commending the President of the United States, President Obama, in the face of insurmountable odds, for not being hampered in wanting to do something with this terrible, terrible scourge that we suffer from in this Nation. Gun violence impacts many different communities in this Nation, some more than others, but it impacts us all. I was proud to see the President step forward and not be hampered in doing something. If the obstructionists on the other side of the aisle want to continue in that manner, then let them be, but he was going to do something. I also commend my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for uniting with the President in this great effort. We understand in our communities what this means. We are trying to articulate it to the American people, but we understand it. We live it. We feel it. We see it. {time} 2115 The President's executive actions on gun control are a step in the right direction, but it is the responsibility of Congress to pass gun reform that makes our communities safer. I have joined, along with Robin Kelly, who mentioned two pieces of her legislation in terms of gun control--after Sandy Hook several years ago, I proposed a piece of legislation that did not really see the light of day. Since the President has not given up on this effort, I will not either. I have a piece of legislation, which is called the Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act. It would keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people by creating a voluntary Federal gun buyback program. Under my bill, State and local governments, as well as gun dealers, would distribute smart, prepaid debit cards to gun owners in exchange for their firearms. My bill incentivizes gun owners to voluntarily get guns off the streets. This will make our communities safer for our children, family, and our businesses. Commonsense proposals like my bill are critical to ending our Nation's epidemic of gun violence. This epidemic impacts every community in America, including in my district. Last year in the city of Newark shootings increased 19 percent from 2014 and homicides rose by 8 percent. In 2015, there were at least 76 gun deaths in my district. One-third of all of the gun deaths in New Jersey last year happened in my district. Gun violence has had a disproportionate impact within the African American community and other urban areas. That is clear when you look at what is happening in my district and throughout other African American communities in New Jersey. We need a Federal approach to gun violence because it is a problem across State lines. Case in point, New Jersey is a net importer of crime guns. In other words, more illegal weapons confiscated by law enforcement came from out of the State than there were purchased from in the State. Reducing gun violence is vital to the safety and security of American communities. My colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle should drop the politics and pandering. They should instead join with Democrats in supporting the President and his commonsense reforms and, like my gun buyback program, to address gun tragedies in all communities. Let me just say, Madam Speaker, no one wants to take guns away from anyone. We understand the laws and liberties that have made this Nation great. If we don't do something in reference to gun control, then it is shame on us. Mr. JEFFRIES. I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), a dynamic new Member of the House. Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our President's actions toward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to end up in the hands of people that shouldn't have them. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty, for bringing this hour here in Congress. I am thankful for the Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour for taking time to educate the American people of the importance of our President's action. While this Congress and, in particular, our Republican colleagues have hemmed and dithered and engaged in political inertia and, at the end, failed to act in this matter, suspected terrorists are free to legally purchase combat-style weapons. American cities and other areas of this country are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, guns cause twice as many deaths in young people as cancer, 5 times as many as heart disease, and 15 times as many as infections. Yet, we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we spend hundreds of millions researching and mitigating the effects of those other maladies. Every day this Congress fails to act more American families mourn, more American lives are cut short, many in their prime, and more American cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics. Even in America's paradise, my home district of the United States Virgin Islands, this is so. In 2015, there were 40 homicides in the U.S. Virgin Islands. On a per capita basis, that homicide rate is more than double that of the city of Chicago. Gun violence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and in other places, along with the United States Virgin Islands, sadly are a near daily occurrence. While we pause for moments of silence after mass shootings like the ones in Newtown or San Bernardino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized. While the President's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know that communities like our own and the many other minority communities across this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence. I want to ask that this Congress act on these things. This Congress has in its power the ability to save thousands of lives. Let us not allow the nearly daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new norm. We must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation in this Congress this year. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the President's action toward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to end up in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. While this Congress fails to act on this matter, suspected terrorists are free to legally purchase combat-style weapons, American cities are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, guns cause twice as many deaths in young people as cancer, five times as many as heart disease and 15 times as many as infections. Yet we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we spend hundreds-of-millions researching and mitigating the affects of those maladies. Every day this Congress fails to act, more American families mourn: more American lives are cut short--many in their prime--and more American cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics. Even in America's paradise: my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 2015, there were 40 homicides in the U.S. Virgin Islands. That's a per capita homicide rate more than double that of the city of Chicago. Gun violence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and the U.S. Virgin Islands, sadly, are a near daily occurrence. And while we pause for moments of silence after mass shootings like the one in New Town or San Bernadino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized. There were 353 mass shootings in this country in 2015--three of which occurred in my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands. One occurred on a crowded boardwalk on a beautiful day in May. The second mass shooting took place in a housing community, where children played just after 5 p.m. one afternoon this past September. The third took place on a busy highway two days after Thanksgiving. A mass shooting occurs just about everyday in this country, yet there are no moments of silence or thoughts and prayers extended to many of the victims. [[Page H275]] While the President's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know that in communities like the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the many other minority communities across this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence. The citizens living in these communities experience inexcusable levels of poverty. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, more than 30 percent of children are living below the poverty level and in Chicago, most of the South and West sides have 40 to 60 percent of residents living below the poverty level. If we are serious about making our communities safer and reducing gun crime, we must take comprehensive action to not only reduce the likelihood of mass shootings like San Bernadino or New Town, but also address the systemic divestment of resources, education, support in communities of color across this country that lead the scourge of gun violence that play out on our inner-city streets everyday. In addition to The President's action, this congress needs to make it a priority to make adequate investments in early childhood education and other programs aimed at lifting children out of poverty. Additionally, making meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system and increasing resources to reduce the flow of drugs and illegal guns through our ports will help fight back the firearm black market. This is not about the second amendment: an overwhelming number of Americans--most gun owners themselves--agree, that we must do something to stop guns from getting into the hands of people who shouldn't have them. This Congress has in its power, the ability to save thousands of lives. Let us not allow the near daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new norm. We must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, last week, President Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence across the United States. President Obama laid out these much-needed steps in the face of Congressional inaction, which will help to reduce the senseless gun violence that affects countless communities across our nation. In 2014, firearms claimed the lives of more than 33,000 Americans. Over 2,800 of those fatalities took place in my home state of Texas. Perhaps there will be a time when we no longer will have to read headlines about mass murders in our schools or movie theaters. But until then, our nation must take concerted steps to strengthen background checks, improve mental health services, and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. This is what President Obama has sought to achieve and I truly believe that this can be done without infringing on law-abiding citizens' right to bear arms. There have been numerous critics of President Obama's executive actions to reduce gun violence. However, we can no longer stand by as gun violence claims the lives of more innocent Americans. The President is limited in what he can achieve through executive actions alone. That is why Congress has the responsibility to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation now and put our nation on the path to preventing such violence from happening again. Mr. Speaker, gun violence affects individuals of all backgrounds in communities all across the United States. It is not a Democratic issue nor is it a Republican issue. It is an issue that affects every American in one form or another. Successfully reducing gun violence in this country will take more than just legislative action from Congress. It will take the collective effort of every American to change the course of our history and end gun violence in America once and for all. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H267-H275] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of this discussion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to rise today and to co-anchor, along with my distinguished colleague from the great State of Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, this CBC Special Order hour, this hour of power. Once again, we are privileged to take to the floor of the people's House to discuss an issue that should be relevant to every Member of this institution on behalf of the 320 million-plus Americans that we represent in this great country, and that is the gun violence epidemic. America has 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns. It is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns in circulation throughout this country. So it seems to me reasonable that we would do everything possible to ensure that not a single one of those guns finds themselves in the hands of individuals who would do us harm. And that in many ways is what President Obama has done as it relates to his most recent executive action. So today members of the Congressional Black Caucus will come to the House floor to discuss those executive actions, discuss the issue of gun violence, discuss the steps that we should be taking, here in this Chamber, in order to keep the people of America that we all collectively represent safe. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my classmate and my co-anchor for this CBC Special Order hour. I look forward to anchoring with her throughout the entire year. She has been a tremendous champion for working families, for the middle class, for small-business owners and, of course, for the young people who are ravaged in our communities all across this country by gun violence. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening proud to stand with my Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour co-anchor, Congressman Jeffries, from the Eighth Congressional District of New York. Mr. Jeffries, it is my honor to stand here today as we undertake an urgent dialogue on how we, as elected Representatives of the people, can work together to end gun violence. I look forward to engaging with Congressman Jeffries and our Congressional Black Caucus colleagues in scholarly debate on the issues plaguing African Americans, African American communities, and to develop solutions to the problems our constituents face. As the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus will remain on the forefront of issues that affect Black Americans in particular, and the Nation, in general. For tonight, our anchor, Congressman Jeffries, has pointed out the CBC will continue to shed light on the epidemic of gun violence, standing our ground, ending gun violence in America. Mr. Speaker, last week we opened the Second Session of the 114th Congress. Four hundred thirty-five of us traveled back to Washington ready to serve our constituents and work for the betterment of our Nation. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, whatever spirit of bipartisanship may have been present at the end of 2015 as Republicans and Democrats worked together on key pieces of legislation has disappeared at the precise time our Nation is calling on Congress to pass commonsense legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. We find ourselves confronted with startling statistics that no Nation should endure. Let me just take a moment to share just a few. We know that the impact of gun violence affects every community and every congressional district. However, African American children and teens are 17 times more likely to die from gun homicide than White youth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While African Americans make up 15 percent of youth in America, African Americans accounted for 45 percent of children and teen gun deaths in 2010. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, 88 Americans die every day from gun violence, Mr. Speaker. Roughly 50 percent of those killed are African American men, who comprise just 6 percent of the population. Homicide is the primary cause of death among African Americans ages 15- 24. Mr. Speaker, these numbers should be unthinkable, unimaginable, but they are the unfortunate reality in which African American communities live. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, whose legacy we honor next Monday, he said: We find ourselves ``confronted with the fierce urgency of now.'' And Mr. Speaker, it is now that our Nation is in an urgent crisis, yet we are trapped in congressional inaction. Shameful. So our President decided he would not stand by idly while Congress did nothing to prevent another Newtown, another Charleston, other Tucson. With tears in his eyes, he reflected on the senseless killings caused by gun violence over the course of his administration. President Obama announced new executive actions to confront the epidemic of gun violence in America. While mocked by some Republicans for showing emotion at the loss of so many lives, I am here to say I proudly stand with my President on the actions he has taken to prevent gun violence in America. These executive actions will save lives and make the country safer without infringing on law-abiding individuals' rights to firearms. You will hear from our colleagues tonight talking about the President's actions. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and to address gun violence. Mr. JEFFRIES. Thank you, Representative Beatty, for laying out the case in such an eloquent and compelling fashion, and pointing out that, with respect to gun safety and gun violence prevention in America, it is long past time when we act with the fierce urgency of now. Tens of thousands of Americans have died as a result of gun violence since the moment you and I first set foot in this institution, and not a single thing has been done by the House of Representatives to prevent those deaths. That is shameful, as you have pointed out, and we need a change of course. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member, lead Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, once, of course, chaired by the legendary Adam Clayton Powell, and Representative Scott has continued in that tremendous visionary tradition. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing tonight's Special Order to focus on the toll that gun violence has taken on communities across America and, especially, the disproportionate impact it has had within communities of color. Tonight's conversation comes at an important time. On average, every day more than 30 people are killed by firearms, many in mass murders. Now, rather than do what they say is celebrate the problem, I want to talk about solutions. Last Tuesday, the President announced the executive actions that his administration will take [[Page H268]] to prevent gun violence. I commend the President for taking this action, in light of the current congressional leadership's refusal to responsibly address this epidemic. These executive actions will ensure stronger enforcement of current laws and will reduce the number of lives lost to gun violence. To begin with, the President's executive actions will narrow the ``gun show'' and Internet loopholes by actually enforcing licensing requirements for gun dealers and overhauling the background check system to make it more effective and efficient. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform criminal background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be ``engaged in the business'' of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the ATF. The executive actions make it clear that the commonsense proposition that anyone making a profit from the sale of guns, or who regularly makes gun sales or earns a livelihood from gun sales, is, in fact, engaged in the business and therefore must obtain a license and conduct required criminal background checks, even if those sales occur at gun shows or over the Internet. {time} 2030 The question of whether someone is engaged in business will be determined by normal legal standards as opposed to people just declaring themselves to be exempt, which is going on now. Some of these people are even making a living selling firearms. They need to get a license. This is the present law, and the President has said that he will enforce it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, as part of executive actions, will overhaul its National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the NICS system, to make it more effective and efficient by hiring more than 230 additional examiners and other staff so that the Bureau can process background checks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and improve its notification of local authorities when prohibited persons unlawfully attempt to purchase a gun. These people are currently breaking the law when they illegally try to buy a firearm, and local law enforcement officials need to be informed. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, this system has already caught more than 2 million people trying to buy guns illegally, and they need to be held accountable for breaking the law. Furthermore, dealers will also be required to notify law enforcement if their guns are lost or stolen in transit. This transparency and accountability will ensure that law enforcement will be notified and can begin investigations when these losses occur. Executive actions will also leverage the buying power of the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun technology. When the Federal Government begins buying guns using that kind of technology, it will make it more likely that this technology will be used. There is technology that makes it impossible for anyone other than the true owner to use weapons, and the more purchases the Federal Government makes, the more likely it is that technology will actually be installed in future weapons. The President has also directed the departments to review the availability of smart gun technology on a regular basis and to explore potential ways to further its use and to encourage research to more broadly improve gun safety. The President's plan also proposes a new $500 million investment to increase access to mental health treatment to ensure that people who need help do not fall through the cracks of the mental health system. This is in addition to the huge increases in mental health funding under the Affordable Care Act. Mental health services are considered essential services, and so now virtually all health insurance policies include mental health coverage. While modest and within the President's executive authority, these executive actions will go a long way in keeping guns out of the hands of people who never should be able to purchase them in the first place. But that is executive action. Congress needs to act so that more can be done to actually protect citizens from gun violence. The House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force has consistently reiterated that Washington has a moral obligation to do something to address our Nation's gun violence epidemic. The most effective way to address this epidemic is through comprehensive, evidence-based policy proposals. Our task force has put forth several proposals that will go a long way in achieving these goals. These proposals include reinstating and strengthening the assault weapon ban, reducing the size of magazines, implementing universal background checks, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and straw purchases, improving our mental health system, and implementing comprehensive, locally tailored, evidence-based violence prevention and intervention programs. The gentleman from California, Representative Mike Thompson, is the chair of the House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and he has introduced a resolution to establish a select committee of the House to study gun violence. That resolution is cosponsored by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and 11 cochairs of the task force. The proposed select committee would be comprised of six Republicans and six Democrats who would study the research and issue a final report and recommendations, including legislative proposals, within 60 days of its establishment. It would study and make recommendations to address many issues, including the causes of mass shootings, methods to improve the Federal firearms purchaser background check system, connections between access to firearms and dangerously mentally ill individuals, Federal penalties for trafficking and straw purchasing of firearms, loopholes that allow some domestic abusers continued access to firearms, linkages between firearms and suicide, gun violence's effect on public health, the correlation between State gun violence prevention laws and the incidence of gun violence, the importance of having reliable, accurate information on gun violence and its toll on our Nation, the implementation of effective gun violence prevention laws in accordance with the Second Amendment to our Constitution, and the rates of gun violence in large metropolitan areas. Mr. Speaker, by taking a deliberate, research-based approach to gun violence, treating it as we would a public health challenge, we can significantly reduce the ravages of gun violence. The President is limited by his executive authority on what alone he can do to address this epidemic. Long-term reforms can only be achieved through congressional action. I hope that the leadership of the Congress will follow the President's lead and act in a bipartisan basis to address this critical issue using public health strategies and evidence-based proposals. Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlelady from Ohio for coordinating this Special Order. Mr. JEFFRIES. Thank you, Representative Scott, for laying out the steps that are being taken by the President in such a compelling way in explaining why they are items that we should all support as well as some of the steps that need to be taken legislatively by this Congress in order to deal with the fact that more than 10,000 Americans a year die as a result of gun violence-related homicides. I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). She is an incredibly eloquent and passionate voice for the voiceless. We appreciate her service here in the Congress not just on behalf of the district that she represents in northern California, but certainly on behalf of the people of the United States of America. I yield now to Congresswoman Barbara Lee. Ms. LEE. First, let me thank the gentleman from New York for those very kind remarks. But also I want to thank you and Congresswoman Beatty for organizing this very important Special Order and for your tremendous leadership, Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty, on ensuring public safety. Your leadership, both Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman [[Page H269]] Jeffries, has been bold, it has been visionary, not just as the result of the very recent tragedies but for many, many years even before both of you came to Congress. So it is an honor serving with both of you in this body. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening. Also, I want to just thank Congresswoman Robin Kelly, who is the vice chair on the Gun Violence Task Force. She also chairs the CBC's Health Braintrust. I thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem, which it is. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to call on Congress to do something--to do something--about the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities. Since the start of the year--just 11 days ago--nine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence, including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller. Just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides. My thoughts are with the victims' family at this very terribly difficult time. We have to do something. Enough is enough. Congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence. Whether it is Charleston, Oak Creek, Sandy Hook, the streets of Oakland or wherever, too many people have already lost their lives, too many families have buried loved ones, and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence. Madam Speaker, now is the time for action. Our constituents are demanding action. The country is demanding action. I have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents, and I know other Members are also hearing from their constituents. They are calling for action as well. Earlier today in my own District, Oakland City Council President Lynette Gibson McElehany buried her grandson, 17-year-old Torian Hughes, who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before Christmas. This has been a very difficult period for Council Member McElehany and her family. So in addition to our prayers not only for my council member's family, but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence, we must do something. We must do something in all of their memory. Let me be clear. Congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents, their families, and communities. Last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of Americans in applauding President Obama's actions to reduce gun violence in our Nation. Thanks to the President's leadership, there will be more background checks, better enforcement of existing gun laws, improved mental health services, and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence. But more action is needed to stop the more than 30,000 gun deaths that occur in our Nation each and every year. Congress must pass commonsense gun reform, like closing the gun show loophole, bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of Americans and gun owners. Congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services. But this should not be an excuse, of course, to do nothing on gun safety. We have got to provide the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives the resources it needs to enforce our Nation's gun laws. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe. We must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcement's ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue. That is why I introduced last year H.R. 1449, the Tiahrt Restrictions Repeal Act, which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks. These data restrictions are commonly called the Tiahrt restrictions. They prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public. These provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the National Criminal Background Check System records to be destroyed--mind you, destroyed--within 24 hours, prohibiting the ATF from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and State law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers. This is outrageous. We have got to restrict and repeal these Tiahrt amendments right away. It will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals. It is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes. The Tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers, law enforcement, and Federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community. Of course, many of us are proud to support Congresswoman Kelly's bill, which would allow the Surgeon General to study gun violence as a public health issue and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to regulate firearms. Madam Speaker, the time for action is now. Let's start listening to the American people and insist that Congress do something. It is really disingenuous to criticize the President for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this body--for years--to get these sensible bills passed. The Speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that Congress can act. No more excuses. We should support Congressman Thompson's proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence. The Speaker should do this now. So we can't continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about Congress. We need to do our job. We have been trying, many of us, the Congressional Black Caucus and others, especially Democrats, for many years to try to get the Speaker to bring these bills to the floor. So what did the President do? He had to do something. But no more excuses. Congress needs to act. So I thank Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries for this very important Special Order hour and for your tremendous leadership. Mr. JEFFRIES. Again, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California for her wonderful remarks, observations, and, of course, her support for the President's executive actions on gun safety, making it clear that the President was left with no choice but to act. Tens of thousands of Americans die each and every year either as it relates to homicide or suicide through a firearm, and nothing was happening here in the United States Congress. The classic definition of legislative insanity is to do the same exact thing, which in this instance is nothing, and expect that things were going to change for the safety and the well-being of the American people. That is why we are here on the floor today expressing strong support for the President's executive actions and pushing this institution to do more and finish the job that the President of the United States of America started. {time} 2045 It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Houston (Ms. Jackson Lee), a forceful advocate and the lead Democrat on the relevant committee on the House Judiciary side of the equation as it relates to criminal justice, reform, and gun safety. She, of course, has been a tremendous champion for the people that she serves down in H-Town, as well as across the country. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. As has been stated by my colleagues, I want to add my applause as well for the thoughtfulness of the gentleman's leadership on a number of issues, but certainly on his pronounced leadership on criminal justice reform and on the Judiciary Committee; and then to be joined by former leader of the Ohio State Legislature--and she has not forgotten her talents of leadership--and that is Congresswoman Joyce Beatty who joins us, if I might put words in both your mouths, with a sense of outrage about where we are today. I say that because I would like to stand here [[Page H270]] with an enormous amount of outrage for where we are and why we are here. I want to add my appreciation to the Congressional Black Caucus, the chairman, Mr. Butterfield, and, of course, Congresswoman Dr. Kelly, who has been a great leader on the issues dealing with health care. I just want to cite to her, a lady that came to this Congress more than a decade ago, Deborah Prothrow-Stith. You may have read her writings. She pronounced during that time that gun violence was a health crisis. That was so many years ago. Unfortunately, with all of her expert writings, we still couldn't get movement. I am going to take a slightly different perspective. If I could just take these few moments to give you an anecdotal story, which many of you might find absolutely with a great deal of shock, if you will. That is the limit to which gun rights advocates mislead the American people on any ideas for gun safety or gun regulation as taking guns away. I was in a meeting where someone was trying to understand why President Obama in his excellent presentation about securing America and protecting our children from gun violence was being associated with the idea of taking over 345 million guns. This is what is represented to be President Obama's message. He will confiscate, through his process of gun testing or making sure that there are background checks for everyone, that he wants to confiscate 345 million guns, which has been determined to be located in 65 million places here in the United States. Can I, in a public forum on this august floor of the House, say that we, as Members of Congress--and I think Republicans will admit this-- have no evidence, no documentation, that the White House intends to confiscate guns--no manner of level of increased ATF officers could ever do that--why this mischaracterization is here. But listen to this. Gun rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the years that the Second Amendment they interpret means that they can buy any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. Well, basically, that does exist, except for the basic constraint of background checks, which now the President has expanded to ensure that if you are in a gun show--this is a gun show loophole--and you are sitting next to the stall of a licensed gun person and you are in the business of selling guns, why shouldn't you be either licensed or require, basically, background checks? But listen to this. In an ongoing legal battle in Florida, they lay claim to a newfangled Second Amendment right: the right not to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. Specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing guns or the potential harms that guns may cause with their patients. While mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the Constitution is on their side. Last month, for the third time in the same suit, a Federal court of appeals agreed. This is very bizarre. The case is filed under the name of Wollschlaeger v. Governor of the State of Florida, although First and Second Amendment buffs may recognize it under the cutesy nickname Docs v. Glocks. It started when some gun owners and the National Rifle Association told Florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking about gun safety--by asking about gun safety. The legislators responded by passing a law that bars healthcare workers from discussing or recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. Twelve other States are thinking about it, and now we have the Privacy of Firearm Owners Act. This is in the face of a number of homicides in this country. Let me cite to my colleagues that America is the number one country out of Western nations that has the highest number of cases of homicide by firearm per 100,000. The closest that comes to them is 0.7 by Italy. Then Taiwan, Canada, and Spain, 0.2; Germany, 0.2. All the news stories that we see on violent disruptions in various places and protests, their numbers of gun violence, of homicides, is miniscule: Australia, 0.1; UK, 0.1; France, 0.1; South Korea, 0.03; and finally Japan, 0.01. If that doesn't get our attention, I don't know what does. Then look at this map; 353 mass shootings in America in 2015. My colleague can see, is this anything to be proud of? Mass shootings not by knives, not by throwing stones, but by guns. This is what America is to the world: a sea of red of mass shootings, so much so that you can't even see background in some of the parts of this Nation. Yet there are laws that are being passed to stop health professionals from asking whether you have guns that might, in fact, endanger your children or yourselves. On average, more than 100,000 people in the United States are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes. More than 32,000 people die from gun violence, including 2,677 children under the age of 18. Gun deaths, justified versus criminal: studies also found that for every 1 justified homicide in the United States involving a gun, guns were used in 44 criminal homicides. In all of our communities, we see young Black men being felled by gun violence, young people in our communities being felled by gun violence, or innocent storekeepers being felled by gun violence, or in the instance of the Philadelphia police officer. All of us respect the dangers of law enforcement, recognizing that we can work together by building prepared and trained law enforcement officers to avoid the violence with guns. But in the instance of this individual, who point-blank shot at an officer with a gun, who has now been determined possibly to have heard voices, though he said he was inspired by ISIS, again, someone wanted to suggest that it wasn't anything that Obama could have done. It was a stolen police gun and it is out on the streets. Obviously, we don't have enough people enforcing against the trafficking of stolen guns. Mass shootings. The U.S. has a far higher number of mass shootings than any others I have indicated. Mental health. Approximately one in four American adults have a mental illness. Every time we hear of these mass shootings, the defense comes, which they have a right, to talk about this person's severe criminal mental illness condition. Guns in suicide is the leading cause of related deaths in America. More than 60 percent of deaths by guns in the country are the result of individuals using these weapons intending to commit suicide--not knives, not stones, not even poison or an overdose on drugs--guns. Guns and domestic violence provide a deadly outcome. Law enforcement killed by guns: each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives in gun violence having been shot to death while protecting their communities. Of course, we know that we have experienced tragic incidences under the authority of law where people have been killed, and the community is over the top in frustration. Background checks save lives. The tragedy at Mother Emanuel is the individual went to buy guns and the store owner said it is taking too long. I support President Obama's very astute and thoughtful approach. Out of that, I am very glad to have introduced two initiatives. One, H.R. 4315, Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act, which is a capture of President Obama's, along with Karen Bass. I urge my colleagues to sign on to H.R. 4315, which authorizes $500 million for health treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health information to the FBI background check system, NICS--not to violate the privacy, but to give more information to the database, because that certainly would be part of saving lives. As I conclude, H.R. 4316, that I am pleased to have Congresswoman Kelly join me in this, the Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act, authorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents, the very point of which my Republican friends are saying, but yet they are condemning what the President has offered. I would say to my colleagues in closing, if we don't do this for any other reason, to take and codify the President's initiatives on NICS or data collection, on research regarding safer guns, on background checks or closing the gun show loophole, if we don't do it, we should do it for the children. [[Page H271]] From December 2012 to December 2013, at least 100 children were killed in unintentional shootings, almost two every week, 61 percent higher than Federal data reflect. About two-thirds of these unintended deaths, at 65 percent, took place in the home or vehicle that belonged to the victim's family, most often with the guns that were legally owned but not secured. I remind you of that Supreme Court challenge or that law in Florida where doctors can't secure information to protect the patients or the children of these families. More than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them. I have introduced legislation on gun storage--I call it safety and responsibility--but yet, unfortunately, it is perceived as attacking the Second Amendment. My good friend from New York (Mr. Jeffries), let me thank you for yielding. Allow me to just leave us with the point that, as the Congressional Black Caucus stands on the floor, we need partners in doing the right thing. I hope before the President leaves office, he will have the opportunity to reasonably and rationally sign bills that will save lives. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Ending Gun Violence in America. Gun violence in America can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified. We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act. Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: to protect and defend the American people. This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem gun violence in our nation. Yet, after another mass shooting and countless acts of gun violence in communities across our country every day, House Republicans are still unwilling to act to stop gun violence and save lives in American communities. The Democrats have been calling for an immediate vote on the bipartisan King-Thompson Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act to strengthen the life-saving background checks that keep guns out of the wrong hands. This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the gun violence epidemic. Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the lives of Americans by taking common sense steps to save lives. The Administration has announced two new executive actions that will help strengthen the federal background check system and keep guns out of the wrong hands. I have introduced two bills that will hopefully enhance these executive actions and support the President's recently announced action on gun violence. H.R. 4315--Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act-- authorizes $500 million for mental health treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health information to the FBI's background check system NICS. H.R. 4316--Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act--authorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents and investigators for enforcement of existing gun laws. The President included these specific requests in yesterday's announcements and these bills respond to those requests. Additionally, the Department of justice (DOJ) is proposing a regulation to clarify who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law for reasons related to mental health. And the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a proposed regulation to address barriers preventing states from submitting limited information on those persons to the federal background check system. Ending gun violence in America requires a comprehensive approach--we must come together and work towards this common goal. Too many Americans have been severely injured or lost their lives as a result of gun violence. While the vast majority of Americans who experience a mental illness are not violent. However, in some cases when persons with a mental illness does not receive the treatment they need, the result can be tragedies such as homicide or suicide. We must continue to address mental health issues by: Supporting expanded coverage of mental health services and enhanced training and hiring of mental health professionals; and Continuing the national conversation on mental health to reduce stigma associated with having a mental illness and getting help; and We must also continue to do everything we can to making sure that anyone who may pose a danger to themselves or others does not have access to a gun. The federal background check system is one of the most effective ways of assuring that such individuals are not able to purchase a firearm from a licensed gun dealer. To date, background checks have prevented over two million guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Administration's two new executive actions will help ensure that better and more reliable information makes its way into the background check system. The Administration, however, has acknowledged the need for collective action and continues to call upon Members of Congress to pass common- sense gun safety legislation and to expand funding to increase access to mental health services. I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that will help stop the loss of innocent lives. While we have made some progress in strengthening the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to run background checks on those who buy guns from federally licensed gun dealers to make sure they are not prohibited by law from owning a firearm, we must do more. I am a strong supporter of a right of privacy and I am particularly sensitive and protective of patient privacy rights. I support the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that was passed by Congress in 1996, and includes privacy protection for medical records, which includes mental healthcare information. However, there are specific areas under federal law that allow the disclosure of medical information to authorities, and in these instances there should be an agreement that when a person poses a threat to themselves or others (as determined by a court or adjudicative authority with the medical and legal knowledge and authority to make a determination that a person poses a threat to themselves or to others) should not be allowed to purchase a fire arm. Technology that could be deployed to access court records and arrest records as they relate to mental health and violent behavior should not rely upon a list that may become out dated or could be used in ways that are not consistent with the intent of enhancing gun safety. The ability to access information that is accurate and available for the limited purpose of affirming or rejecting a request to purchase a firearm without indicating the source of the decision or the reason for the rejection would still protect privacy rights while also protecting the public. The president's proposal on mental health and gun violence is to enforce the laws already in place. Under a federal law enacted in 1968, an individual is prohibited from buying or possessing firearms for life if he/she has been ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' or ``committed to a mental institution.'' A person is ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' if a court--or other entity having legal authority to make adjudications--has made a determination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) Is a danger to himself or to others; 2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs; 3) Is found insane by a court in a criminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A person is ``committed to a mental institution'' if that person has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or other lawful authority. This expressly excludes voluntary commitment. It should be noted, however, that federal law currently allows states to establish procedures for mentally ill individuals to restore their right to possess and purchase firearms (many states have done so at the behest of the National Rifle Association, with questionable results). It is undoubtedly true that people who are a danger to self and/or others because of mental illness should be prohibited from owning firearms. It is less clear, however, how to tailor new policies to better protect the American public while at the same time avoiding the stigmatization of Americans with mental illness. Any strategy to address the lethal intersection between guns and mental illness should focus on the key facts: On average, more than 100,000 people in America are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes. More than 32,000 people die from gun violence annually, including 2,677 children under the age of eighteen years old. Suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in America. 60 percent of deaths by guns in America are the result of individuals using these weapons as a means to commit suicide. [[Page H272]] Some of these deaths might have been prevented if there were adequate background checks. Each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives to gun violence been shot to death protecting their communities. Millions of guns are sold every year in ``no questions asked'' transactions and experts estimate that 40 percent of guns now sold in America are done so without a background check. National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was created in 1998 to require potential gun buyers to pass an instant screening at the point of purchase. Ensures that purchasers are not felons, domestic abusers, mentally ill, etc. NICS has blocked sales to more than 2 million prohibited people. NICS stops 170 felons and 53 domestic abusers from purchasing guns every day. The most serious issue facing NICS is the ``private sale loophole''. This allows anyone who is not a federally-licensed dealer to sell guns without a background check. An estimated 40% of gun transfers--6.6 million transfers--are conducted without a background check. Armslist.com is the largest online seller of firearms. 66,000 gun ads are posted by private sellers on a given day, 750,000 per year. Nearly 1/3rd of gun ads on Armslist.com are posted by high-volume unlicensed sellers (approx. 4,218 people). High-volume sellers posted 29% of the gun ads. High-volume sellers posted 36,069 gun ads over 2 months. This would equate to around 243,800 guns each year by unlicensed sellers. 50% were familiar with federal laws but decided they didn't apply to them. 1/3rd of ``want-to-buy'' ads are posted by people with a criminal record. More than 4 times the rate at which prohibited gun buyers try to buy guns in stores. Approximately 25,000 guns are in illegal hands. [From Slate, Jan. 8, 2016] The Absurd Logic Behind Florida's Docs vs. Glocks Law The Second Amendment trumps all other amendments (By Dahlia Lithwick and Sonja West) Gun-rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the years about the broad scope of their constitutional rights. They say, in effect, that the Second Amendment means they can buy virtually any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. But in an ongoing legal battle in Florida, they lay claim to a newfangled Second Amendment right--the right not to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. Specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing guns, or the potential harms those guns may cause, with their patients. And while mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the Constitution is on their side. Last month, for the third time in the same suit, a federal court of appeals agreed. This very bizarre case is filed under the name of Wollschlaeger v. Governor of the State of Florida, although First and Second amendment buffs may recognize it under the cutesy nickname Docs vs. Glocks. It started when some gun owners (and the National Rifle Association) told Florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking about gun safety. The legislators responded by passing a law that bars health care workers from discussing or recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. (Twelve other states have considered enacting similar legislation, but only Florida has actually passed such a law.) The result was the Firearms Owners' Privacy Act. The law provides that licensed health care practitioners and facilities: ``may not intentionally enter'' information concerning a patient's ownership of firearms into the patient's medical record that the practitioner knows is ``not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others,'' and ``shall respect a patient's right to privacy and should refrain'' from inquiring as to whether a patient or their family owns firearms, unless the practitioner or facility believes in good faith that the ``information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.'' Violations of the act could lead to disciplinary action including fines and suspension, or revocation of a medical license. Proponents of such laws say these doctor-patient dialogues violate the patients' Second Amendment rights. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for the tremendous work you continue to do on the Judiciary Committee. I look forward to partnering with you. As you point out, the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms. It should not protect the ability of others to utilize weapons, often of mass destruction, in doing harm to Americans without a license or any legal bases for doing so. All we want is rational gun safety and gun violence prevention. I look forward to continuing to work with you in that regard. It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), one of my classmates. She has been a tremendous and forceful advocate for gun violence prevention measures, not only as the chair of the CBC Health Braintrust, for which she has been tireless on so many different issues, but also in her capacity within the House Democratic Caucus, as well as a chair of the CBC Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, someone who stood up countless times for the children in Chicago and the many others who have been dealing with unacceptable levels of gun violence. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank my good friends, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for this important Special Order hour tonight. Congressman Jeffries, you have chaired these Special Order hours for the Congressional Black Caucus in my first term, so it is good to see you back in the driver's seat with our classmate, Representative Beatty. Last year, I had the privilege of leading the Special Order hour with our colleague, the Honorable Donald Payne of New Jersey. In the course of that year, we came to this floor to reflect on gun violence on one too many occasions because it is an epidemic in communities across the country. In fact, we are 11 days into 2016, and there have already been 80 shootings in my hometown of Chicago. Four people were shot and killed in less than 24 hours. I applaud President Obama's bold executive action that has been talked about tonight. I believe these policies will keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous individuals. If you listen to some, they will say they are trying to take our guns. There is nothing in the executive action that says that. The opposition is pushing fear, not fact. With over 30 Americans killed by guns every single day inaction is not an option. {time} 2100 In my nearly 3 years in Congress, the majority party has refused to do anything on gun violence--not one hearing, not a single vote. To right what Congress has, unfortunately, made wrong, President Obama did what was necessary to address the threat to our long-term national security and economic stability. While we can't stop every criminal from committing every crime, we can take actions that will save lives. While President Obama's executive actions are crucial steps in reducing the senseless gun violence that is plaguing our Nation, they do not absolve Congress of its moral responsibility to act. There are gaps in existing gun laws that leave us all vulnerable to gun violence. These holes are ones that only Congress can plug. I have two commonsense bills that will complement President Obama's executive actions and that will help bring a reduction in firearm mortality. The first bill, H.R. 224, the Recognizing Gun Violence as a Public Health Emergency Act, would require the Surgeon General to submit an annual report to Congress on the public health impact of gun violence. The bill currently has 135 cosponsors, and I hope that this commonsense proposal can get an up-or-down vote this year. Also, I recently introduced H.R. 225, the Firearm Safety Act, which would close the loophole which prevents the Consumer Product Safety Commission from creating rules regarding the safety of firearms. Quite simply, if the Consumer Product Safety Commission can regulate teddy bears, bicycle helmets, and car seats, it should be able to regulate firearms. Simply improving safety lock quality and improving storage safety will reduce accidents, misfires, and will prevent theft, saving thousands of lives. Senseless gun violence has been plaguing our Nation for far too long. It is simply unacceptable in the United States of America that gun violence is the leading cause of death for people under 24. It is time for us to come together to end the gun violence that is [[Page H273]] taking a generation of young Americans. I often ask: Just how many and just who has to die before we take action? I urge my colleagues to attend a funeral to see and to feel the hurt and loss. Your standing for moments of silence and then your sitting in silence does nothing to deal with this issue. Let's stop the hypocrisy and take action and save lives. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman, my good friend from Illinois, for the very powerful presentation and for her steadfast leadership. Madam Speaker, one of the reasons we believe that Members of Congress need to act is that State laws are so inconsistent from one jurisdiction to the other. In New York, we experience gun violence in certain communities at unprecedented levels notwithstanding the fact that we have tremendously significant and robust gun violence prevention measures in place. But the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in the Brooklyn communities, represented by me and Yvette Clarke, actually come from the neighboring States of Pennsylvania as well as up the I-95 corridor from States in the Deep South. Chicago, as Robin Kelly has indicated, has been experiencing unprecedented levels of gun violence. Illinois actually has pretty robust gun safety-gun violence prevention laws on the books, but the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in Chicago come from the neighboring States of Indiana and Wisconsin, which have lax laws. Out in south central Los Angeles, the situation has gotten better over the last decade or so. California has pretty strong gun safety-gun violence prevention laws. The overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in south central Los Angeles and in east LA actually come from the neighboring State of Arizona. That is why we need Congress to act in order to deal with what is a national problem. Madam Speaker, it is now my great honor and privilege to yield to my good friend and colleague, my sister from the neighboring congressional district of mine and who has been such a forceful advocate on behalf of the communities that she represents in Brooklyn, the distinguished gentlewoman from the Ninth Congressional District of New York, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Let me first start by thanking my brother from the neighboring district in Brooklyn, New York (Mr. Jeffries), alongside my sister from Ohio, Mrs. Joyce Beatty, for their leadership in our Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, discussing gun violence and gun safety measures. Let me also commend the Honorable Robin Kelly of Illinois for her leadership in doing the work that she is doing not only with our Health Braintrust, but by being an outspoken and forceful advocate for the end to gun violence not only for her district in Chicago, Illinois, but for all communities across this Nation. Madam Speaker, gun violence in the United States has reached epic proportions in the 21st century. The death, the trauma, the devastation that we are witnessing can no longer be tolerated. Congress must act now. Over the past decade in America, more than 100,000 people have been killed as a result of gun violence and millions more have been maimed by the reckless and unlawful discharging of firearms. I applaud President Barack Obama for taking this historic executive action to address gun violence in our Nation. These actions will save lives and will make America a safer place. The President's actions will strengthen lifesaving background checks, improve mental health services, and expand smart gun technology. We have all that we need in the United States to observe the Second Amendment rights of Americans and, at the same time, to take our Nation into the 21st century with responsible gun ownership that leaves little room for the illegal gun activity that we see taking place in terms of gun trafficking, in terms of the use of deadly arms in the hands of those who are unlicensed to hold them. As it relates to background checks, the proposals focus on new background check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the NICS, and the greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the State level. Specifically, it directs the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to obtain a Federal license to do so and to conduct background checks. It calls for the increased funding for the ATF in the hiring of 200 new ATF agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws, and it requires the ATF to issue a rule requiring background checks for the purchasers who purchase certain dangerous firearms and other items through a trust, a corporation, or other legal entity. It encourages greater communication between Federal and State authorities on criminal history information. What could be wrong with that? That is within the boundary of our laws, within our constitutional rights, and it makes our Nation safer. I come to this floor today as one who considers herself to be a victim of gun violence. We need to confront this right away because, for many in our communities, it is not only those who have been physically harmed by gun violence, but those who have been traumatized by being a witness to gun violence. I had the unfortunate privilege, if you will, of being in the Council Chambers of the New York City's City Council when my colleague, the Honorable James E. Davis, was gunned down before all of his colleagues--workplace domestic terrorism. That incident has been with me from that day forward. To this day, at a moment's notice, I can recall the trauma of that day, what it meant to see my colleague's life taken from him and to hear the gunplay that took place in the New York City Council's chambers. I am not alone. There are millions of Americans who are witnesses to gun violence or who may have been maimed by gun violence and who did not necessarily die as a result of it, but whose lives have been changed dramatically. We should not have another generation of Americans who can speak to the unspeakable horror of what it is to either be impacted directly in the loss of a loved one or to be the families who have to recount the times when they have had to be at the hospital with someone who is trying to recover from being gunned down. It is our obligation, our responsibility, as lawmakers for this Nation to get this right for future generations. So I applaud President Obama for doing what he could do within the parameters of his authority. It is now time for the United States House to do its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend and colleague for a very powerful presentation and for pointing out the sensibility of supporting all of the President's efforts, but particularly as they relate to the ATF, which is the Federal agency charged with enforcing our Nation's gun laws. Two hundred additional agents is the bare minimum that we can hire to make sure that the ATF has the manpower and resources necessary to prevent the illegal trafficking of guns into places like the Brownsville and East Flatbush neighborhoods that Congresswoman Yvette Clarke so passionately represents. If you block funding for the ATF, what you essentially are doing is supporting the efforts of the merchants of death who rely on underenforcement by the ATF, because of an absence of resources, in order to flood communities like Chicago; south central Los Angeles; parts of Brooklyn; Newark, New Jersey; and many other neighborhoods with illegal weapons. Madam Speaker, I yield to my good friend and colleague, Congressman Donald Payne. I thank him as well as R. Kelly. D. Payne and R. Kelly made a fantastic combination. We thank them for their distinguished service last year in leading the CBC Special Order hour. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PAYNE. Let me thank the gentleman from New York, who passed the baton to R. Kelly and me in 2015. We have rounded the corner and have put it back in his capable hands, along with our classmate's, the honorable [[Page H274]] gentlewoman from the great State of Ohio, Joyce Beatty, who is demonstrating day in and day out why she was such a great leader in the Ohio legislature. She has brought those talents to bear on the entire Nation. Madam Speaker, these are very serious times. I want to start out by commending the President of the United States, President Obama, in the face of insurmountable odds, for not being hampered in wanting to do something with this terrible, terrible scourge that we suffer from in this Nation. Gun violence impacts many different communities in this Nation, some more than others, but it impacts us all. I was proud to see the President step forward and not be hampered in doing something. If the obstructionists on the other side of the aisle want to continue in that manner, then let them be, but he was going to do something. I also commend my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for uniting with the President in this great effort. We understand in our communities what this means. We are trying to articulate it to the American people, but we understand it. We live it. We feel it. We see it. {time} 2115 The President's executive actions on gun control are a step in the right direction, but it is the responsibility of Congress to pass gun reform that makes our communities safer. I have joined, along with Robin Kelly, who mentioned two pieces of her legislation in terms of gun control--after Sandy Hook several years ago, I proposed a piece of legislation that did not really see the light of day. Since the President has not given up on this effort, I will not either. I have a piece of legislation, which is called the Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act. It would keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people by creating a voluntary Federal gun buyback program. Under my bill, State and local governments, as well as gun dealers, would distribute smart, prepaid debit cards to gun owners in exchange for their firearms. My bill incentivizes gun owners to voluntarily get guns off the streets. This will make our communities safer for our children, family, and our businesses. Commonsense proposals like my bill are critical to ending our Nation's epidemic of gun violence. This epidemic impacts every community in America, including in my district. Last year in the city of Newark shootings increased 19 percent from 2014 and homicides rose by 8 percent. In 2015, there were at least 76 gun deaths in my district. One-third of all of the gun deaths in New Jersey last year happened in my district. Gun violence has had a disproportionate impact within the African American community and other urban areas. That is clear when you look at what is happening in my district and throughout other African American communities in New Jersey. We need a Federal approach to gun violence because it is a problem across State lines. Case in point, New Jersey is a net importer of crime guns. In other words, more illegal weapons confiscated by law enforcement came from out of the State than there were purchased from in the State. Reducing gun violence is vital to the safety and security of American communities. My colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle should drop the politics and pandering. They should instead join with Democrats in supporting the President and his commonsense reforms and, like my gun buyback program, to address gun tragedies in all communities. Let me just say, Madam Speaker, no one wants to take guns away from anyone. We understand the laws and liberties that have made this Nation great. If we don't do something in reference to gun control, then it is shame on us. Mr. JEFFRIES. I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), a dynamic new Member of the House. Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our President's actions toward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to end up in the hands of people that shouldn't have them. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty, for bringing this hour here in Congress. I am thankful for the Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour for taking time to educate the American people of the importance of our President's action. While this Congress and, in particular, our Republican colleagues have hemmed and dithered and engaged in political inertia and, at the end, failed to act in this matter, suspected terrorists are free to legally purchase combat-style weapons. American cities and other areas of this country are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, guns cause twice as many deaths in young people as cancer, 5 times as many as heart disease, and 15 times as many as infections. Yet, we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we spend hundreds of millions researching and mitigating the effects of those other maladies. Every day this Congress fails to act more American families mourn, more American lives are cut short, many in their prime, and more American cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics. Even in America's paradise, my home district of the United States Virgin Islands, this is so. In 2015, there were 40 homicides in the U.S. Virgin Islands. On a per capita basis, that homicide rate is more than double that of the city of Chicago. Gun violence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and in other places, along with the United States Virgin Islands, sadly are a near daily occurrence. While we pause for moments of silence after mass shootings like the ones in Newtown or San Bernardino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized. While the President's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know that communities like our own and the many other minority communities across this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence. I want to ask that this Congress act on these things. This Congress has in its power the ability to save thousands of lives. Let us not allow the nearly daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new norm. We must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation in this Congress this year. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the President's action toward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to end up in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. While this Congress fails to act on this matter, suspected terrorists are free to legally purchase combat-style weapons, American cities are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, guns cause twice as many deaths in young people as cancer, five times as many as heart disease and 15 times as many as infections. Yet we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we spend hundreds-of-millions researching and mitigating the affects of those maladies. Every day this Congress fails to act, more American families mourn: more American lives are cut short--many in their prime--and more American cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics. Even in America's paradise: my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 2015, there were 40 homicides in the U.S. Virgin Islands. That's a per capita homicide rate more than double that of the city of Chicago. Gun violence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and the U.S. Virgin Islands, sadly, are a near daily occurrence. And while we pause for moments of silence after mass shootings like the one in New Town or San Bernadino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized. There were 353 mass shootings in this country in 2015--three of which occurred in my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands. One occurred on a crowded boardwalk on a beautiful day in May. The second mass shooting took place in a housing community, where children played just after 5 p.m. one afternoon this past September. The third took place on a busy highway two days after Thanksgiving. A mass shooting occurs just about everyday in this country, yet there are no moments of silence or thoughts and prayers extended to many of the victims. [[Page H275]] While the President's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know that in communities like the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the many other minority communities across this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence. The citizens living in these communities experience inexcusable levels of poverty. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, more than 30 percent of children are living below the poverty level and in Chicago, most of the South and West sides have 40 to 60 percent of residents living below the poverty level. If we are serious about making our communities safer and reducing gun crime, we must take comprehensive action to not only reduce the likelihood of mass shootings like San Bernadino or New Town, but also address the systemic divestment of resources, education, support in communities of color across this country that lead the scourge of gun violence that play out on our inner-city streets everyday. In addition to The President's action, this congress needs to make it a priority to make adequate investments in early childhood education and other programs aimed at lifting children out of poverty. Additionally, making meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system and increasing resources to reduce the flow of drugs and illegal guns through our ports will help fight back the firearm black market. This is not about the second amendment: an overwhelming number of Americans--most gun owners themselves--agree, that we must do something to stop guns from getting into the hands of people who shouldn't have them. This Congress has in its power, the ability to save thousands of lives. Let us not allow the near daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new norm. We must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, last week, President Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence across the United States. President Obama laid out these much-needed steps in the face of Congressional inaction, which will help to reduce the senseless gun violence that affects countless communities across our nation. In 2014, firearms claimed the lives of more than 33,000 Americans. Over 2,800 of those fatalities took place in my home state of Texas. Perhaps there will be a time when we no longer will have to read headlines about mass murders in our schools or movie theaters. But until then, our nation must take concerted steps to strengthen background checks, improve mental health services, and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. This is what President Obama has sought to achieve and I truly believe that this can be done without infringing on law-abiding citizens' right to bear arms. There have been numerous critics of President Obama's executive actions to reduce gun violence. However, we can no longer stand by as gun violence claims the lives of more innocent Americans. The President is limited in what he can achieve through executive actions alone. That is why Congress has the responsibility to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation now and put our nation on the path to preventing such violence from happening again. Mr. Speaker, gun violence affects individuals of all backgrounds in communities all across the United States. It is not a Democratic issue nor is it a Republican issue. It is an issue that affects every American in one form or another. Successfully reducing gun violence in this country will take more than just legislative action from Congress. It will take the collective effort of every American to change the course of our history and end gun violence in America once and for all. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H267-H275] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add any extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of this discussion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to rise today and to co-anchor, along with my distinguished colleague from the great State of Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, this CBC Special Order hour, this hour of power. Once again, we are privileged to take to the floor of the people's House to discuss an issue that should be relevant to every Member of this institution on behalf of the 320 million-plus Americans that we represent in this great country, and that is the gun violence epidemic. America has 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns. It is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns in circulation throughout this country. So it seems to me reasonable that we would do everything possible to ensure that not a single one of those guns finds themselves in the hands of individuals who would do us harm. And that in many ways is what President Obama has done as it relates to his most recent executive action. So today members of the Congressional Black Caucus will come to the House floor to discuss those executive actions, discuss the issue of gun violence, discuss the steps that we should be taking, here in this Chamber, in order to keep the people of America that we all collectively represent safe. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my classmate and my co-anchor for this CBC Special Order hour. I look forward to anchoring with her throughout the entire year. She has been a tremendous champion for working families, for the middle class, for small-business owners and, of course, for the young people who are ravaged in our communities all across this country by gun violence. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening proud to stand with my Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour co-anchor, Congressman Jeffries, from the Eighth Congressional District of New York. Mr. Jeffries, it is my honor to stand here today as we undertake an urgent dialogue on how we, as elected Representatives of the people, can work together to end gun violence. I look forward to engaging with Congressman Jeffries and our Congressional Black Caucus colleagues in scholarly debate on the issues plaguing African Americans, African American communities, and to develop solutions to the problems our constituents face. As the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus will remain on the forefront of issues that affect Black Americans in particular, and the Nation, in general. For tonight, our anchor, Congressman Jeffries, has pointed out the CBC will continue to shed light on the epidemic of gun violence, standing our ground, ending gun violence in America. Mr. Speaker, last week we opened the Second Session of the 114th Congress. Four hundred thirty-five of us traveled back to Washington ready to serve our constituents and work for the betterment of our Nation. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, whatever spirit of bipartisanship may have been present at the end of 2015 as Republicans and Democrats worked together on key pieces of legislation has disappeared at the precise time our Nation is calling on Congress to pass commonsense legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. We find ourselves confronted with startling statistics that no Nation should endure. Let me just take a moment to share just a few. We know that the impact of gun violence affects every community and every congressional district. However, African American children and teens are 17 times more likely to die from gun homicide than White youth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While African Americans make up 15 percent of youth in America, African Americans accounted for 45 percent of children and teen gun deaths in 2010. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, 88 Americans die every day from gun violence, Mr. Speaker. Roughly 50 percent of those killed are African American men, who comprise just 6 percent of the population. Homicide is the primary cause of death among African Americans ages 15- 24. Mr. Speaker, these numbers should be unthinkable, unimaginable, but they are the unfortunate reality in which African American communities live. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, whose legacy we honor next Monday, he said: We find ourselves ``confronted with the fierce urgency of now.'' And Mr. Speaker, it is now that our Nation is in an urgent crisis, yet we are trapped in congressional inaction. Shameful. So our President decided he would not stand by idly while Congress did nothing to prevent another Newtown, another Charleston, other Tucson. With tears in his eyes, he reflected on the senseless killings caused by gun violence over the course of his administration. President Obama announced new executive actions to confront the epidemic of gun violence in America. While mocked by some Republicans for showing emotion at the loss of so many lives, I am here to say I proudly stand with my President on the actions he has taken to prevent gun violence in America. These executive actions will save lives and make the country safer without infringing on law-abiding individuals' rights to firearms. You will hear from our colleagues tonight talking about the President's actions. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and to address gun violence. Mr. JEFFRIES. Thank you, Representative Beatty, for laying out the case in such an eloquent and compelling fashion, and pointing out that, with respect to gun safety and gun violence prevention in America, it is long past time when we act with the fierce urgency of now. Tens of thousands of Americans have died as a result of gun violence since the moment you and I first set foot in this institution, and not a single thing has been done by the House of Representatives to prevent those deaths. That is shameful, as you have pointed out, and we need a change of course. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member, lead Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee, once, of course, chaired by the legendary Adam Clayton Powell, and Representative Scott has continued in that tremendous visionary tradition. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing tonight's Special Order to focus on the toll that gun violence has taken on communities across America and, especially, the disproportionate impact it has had within communities of color. Tonight's conversation comes at an important time. On average, every day more than 30 people are killed by firearms, many in mass murders. Now, rather than do what they say is celebrate the problem, I want to talk about solutions. Last Tuesday, the President announced the executive actions that his administration will take [[Page H268]] to prevent gun violence. I commend the President for taking this action, in light of the current congressional leadership's refusal to responsibly address this epidemic. These executive actions will ensure stronger enforcement of current laws and will reduce the number of lives lost to gun violence. To begin with, the President's executive actions will narrow the ``gun show'' and Internet loopholes by actually enforcing licensing requirements for gun dealers and overhauling the background check system to make it more effective and efficient. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform criminal background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be ``engaged in the business'' of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the ATF. The executive actions make it clear that the commonsense proposition that anyone making a profit from the sale of guns, or who regularly makes gun sales or earns a livelihood from gun sales, is, in fact, engaged in the business and therefore must obtain a license and conduct required criminal background checks, even if those sales occur at gun shows or over the Internet. {time} 2030 The question of whether someone is engaged in business will be determined by normal legal standards as opposed to people just declaring themselves to be exempt, which is going on now. Some of these people are even making a living selling firearms. They need to get a license. This is the present law, and the President has said that he will enforce it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, as part of executive actions, will overhaul its National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the NICS system, to make it more effective and efficient by hiring more than 230 additional examiners and other staff so that the Bureau can process background checks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and improve its notification of local authorities when prohibited persons unlawfully attempt to purchase a gun. These people are currently breaking the law when they illegally try to buy a firearm, and local law enforcement officials need to be informed. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, this system has already caught more than 2 million people trying to buy guns illegally, and they need to be held accountable for breaking the law. Furthermore, dealers will also be required to notify law enforcement if their guns are lost or stolen in transit. This transparency and accountability will ensure that law enforcement will be notified and can begin investigations when these losses occur. Executive actions will also leverage the buying power of the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun technology. When the Federal Government begins buying guns using that kind of technology, it will make it more likely that this technology will be used. There is technology that makes it impossible for anyone other than the true owner to use weapons, and the more purchases the Federal Government makes, the more likely it is that technology will actually be installed in future weapons. The President has also directed the departments to review the availability of smart gun technology on a regular basis and to explore potential ways to further its use and to encourage research to more broadly improve gun safety. The President's plan also proposes a new $500 million investment to increase access to mental health treatment to ensure that people who need help do not fall through the cracks of the mental health system. This is in addition to the huge increases in mental health funding under the Affordable Care Act. Mental health services are considered essential services, and so now virtually all health insurance policies include mental health coverage. While modest and within the President's executive authority, these executive actions will go a long way in keeping guns out of the hands of people who never should be able to purchase them in the first place. But that is executive action. Congress needs to act so that more can be done to actually protect citizens from gun violence. The House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force has consistently reiterated that Washington has a moral obligation to do something to address our Nation's gun violence epidemic. The most effective way to address this epidemic is through comprehensive, evidence-based policy proposals. Our task force has put forth several proposals that will go a long way in achieving these goals. These proposals include reinstating and strengthening the assault weapon ban, reducing the size of magazines, implementing universal background checks, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and straw purchases, improving our mental health system, and implementing comprehensive, locally tailored, evidence-based violence prevention and intervention programs. The gentleman from California, Representative Mike Thompson, is the chair of the House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and he has introduced a resolution to establish a select committee of the House to study gun violence. That resolution is cosponsored by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and 11 cochairs of the task force. The proposed select committee would be comprised of six Republicans and six Democrats who would study the research and issue a final report and recommendations, including legislative proposals, within 60 days of its establishment. It would study and make recommendations to address many issues, including the causes of mass shootings, methods to improve the Federal firearms purchaser background check system, connections between access to firearms and dangerously mentally ill individuals, Federal penalties for trafficking and straw purchasing of firearms, loopholes that allow some domestic abusers continued access to firearms, linkages between firearms and suicide, gun violence's effect on public health, the correlation between State gun violence prevention laws and the incidence of gun violence, the importance of having reliable, accurate information on gun violence and its toll on our Nation, the implementation of effective gun violence prevention laws in accordance with the Second Amendment to our Constitution, and the rates of gun violence in large metropolitan areas. Mr. Speaker, by taking a deliberate, research-based approach to gun violence, treating it as we would a public health challenge, we can significantly reduce the ravages of gun violence. The President is limited by his executive authority on what alone he can do to address this epidemic. Long-term reforms can only be achieved through congressional action. I hope that the leadership of the Congress will follow the President's lead and act in a bipartisan basis to address this critical issue using public health strategies and evidence-based proposals. Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlelady from Ohio for coordinating this Special Order. Mr. JEFFRIES. Thank you, Representative Scott, for laying out the steps that are being taken by the President in such a compelling way in explaining why they are items that we should all support as well as some of the steps that need to be taken legislatively by this Congress in order to deal with the fact that more than 10,000 Americans a year die as a result of gun violence-related homicides. I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). She is an incredibly eloquent and passionate voice for the voiceless. We appreciate her service here in the Congress not just on behalf of the district that she represents in northern California, but certainly on behalf of the people of the United States of America. I yield now to Congresswoman Barbara Lee. Ms. LEE. First, let me thank the gentleman from New York for those very kind remarks. But also I want to thank you and Congresswoman Beatty for organizing this very important Special Order and for your tremendous leadership, Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty, on ensuring public safety. Your leadership, both Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman [[Page H269]] Jeffries, has been bold, it has been visionary, not just as the result of the very recent tragedies but for many, many years even before both of you came to Congress. So it is an honor serving with both of you in this body. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening. Also, I want to just thank Congresswoman Robin Kelly, who is the vice chair on the Gun Violence Task Force. She also chairs the CBC's Health Braintrust. I thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem, which it is. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to call on Congress to do something--to do something--about the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities. Since the start of the year--just 11 days ago--nine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence, including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller. Just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides. My thoughts are with the victims' family at this very terribly difficult time. We have to do something. Enough is enough. Congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence. Whether it is Charleston, Oak Creek, Sandy Hook, the streets of Oakland or wherever, too many people have already lost their lives, too many families have buried loved ones, and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence. Madam Speaker, now is the time for action. Our constituents are demanding action. The country is demanding action. I have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents, and I know other Members are also hearing from their constituents. They are calling for action as well. Earlier today in my own District, Oakland City Council President Lynette Gibson McElehany buried her grandson, 17-year-old Torian Hughes, who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before Christmas. This has been a very difficult period for Council Member McElehany and her family. So in addition to our prayers not only for my council member's family, but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence, we must do something. We must do something in all of their memory. Let me be clear. Congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents, their families, and communities. Last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of Americans in applauding President Obama's actions to reduce gun violence in our Nation. Thanks to the President's leadership, there will be more background checks, better enforcement of existing gun laws, improved mental health services, and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence. But more action is needed to stop the more than 30,000 gun deaths that occur in our Nation each and every year. Congress must pass commonsense gun reform, like closing the gun show loophole, bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of Americans and gun owners. Congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services. But this should not be an excuse, of course, to do nothing on gun safety. We have got to provide the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives the resources it needs to enforce our Nation's gun laws. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe. We must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcement's ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue. That is why I introduced last year H.R. 1449, the Tiahrt Restrictions Repeal Act, which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks. These data restrictions are commonly called the Tiahrt restrictions. They prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public. These provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the National Criminal Background Check System records to be destroyed--mind you, destroyed--within 24 hours, prohibiting the ATF from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and State law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers. This is outrageous. We have got to restrict and repeal these Tiahrt amendments right away. It will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals. It is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes. The Tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers, law enforcement, and Federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community. Of course, many of us are proud to support Congresswoman Kelly's bill, which would allow the Surgeon General to study gun violence as a public health issue and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to regulate firearms. Madam Speaker, the time for action is now. Let's start listening to the American people and insist that Congress do something. It is really disingenuous to criticize the President for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this body--for years--to get these sensible bills passed. The Speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that Congress can act. No more excuses. We should support Congressman Thompson's proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence. The Speaker should do this now. So we can't continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about Congress. We need to do our job. We have been trying, many of us, the Congressional Black Caucus and others, especially Democrats, for many years to try to get the Speaker to bring these bills to the floor. So what did the President do? He had to do something. But no more excuses. Congress needs to act. So I thank Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman Jeffries for this very important Special Order hour and for your tremendous leadership. Mr. JEFFRIES. Again, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California for her wonderful remarks, observations, and, of course, her support for the President's executive actions on gun safety, making it clear that the President was left with no choice but to act. Tens of thousands of Americans die each and every year either as it relates to homicide or suicide through a firearm, and nothing was happening here in the United States Congress. The classic definition of legislative insanity is to do the same exact thing, which in this instance is nothing, and expect that things were going to change for the safety and the well-being of the American people. That is why we are here on the floor today expressing strong support for the President's executive actions and pushing this institution to do more and finish the job that the President of the United States of America started. {time} 2045 It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Houston (Ms. Jackson Lee), a forceful advocate and the lead Democrat on the relevant committee on the House Judiciary side of the equation as it relates to criminal justice, reform, and gun safety. She, of course, has been a tremendous champion for the people that she serves down in H-Town, as well as across the country. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. As has been stated by my colleagues, I want to add my applause as well for the thoughtfulness of the gentleman's leadership on a number of issues, but certainly on his pronounced leadership on criminal justice reform and on the Judiciary Committee; and then to be joined by former leader of the Ohio State Legislature--and she has not forgotten her talents of leadership--and that is Congresswoman Joyce Beatty who joins us, if I might put words in both your mouths, with a sense of outrage about where we are today. I say that because I would like to stand here [[Page H270]] with an enormous amount of outrage for where we are and why we are here. I want to add my appreciation to the Congressional Black Caucus, the chairman, Mr. Butterfield, and, of course, Congresswoman Dr. Kelly, who has been a great leader on the issues dealing with health care. I just want to cite to her, a lady that came to this Congress more than a decade ago, Deborah Prothrow-Stith. You may have read her writings. She pronounced during that time that gun violence was a health crisis. That was so many years ago. Unfortunately, with all of her expert writings, we still couldn't get movement. I am going to take a slightly different perspective. If I could just take these few moments to give you an anecdotal story, which many of you might find absolutely with a great deal of shock, if you will. That is the limit to which gun rights advocates mislead the American people on any ideas for gun safety or gun regulation as taking guns away. I was in a meeting where someone was trying to understand why President Obama in his excellent presentation about securing America and protecting our children from gun violence was being associated with the idea of taking over 345 million guns. This is what is represented to be President Obama's message. He will confiscate, through his process of gun testing or making sure that there are background checks for everyone, that he wants to confiscate 345 million guns, which has been determined to be located in 65 million places here in the United States. Can I, in a public forum on this august floor of the House, say that we, as Members of Congress--and I think Republicans will admit this-- have no evidence, no documentation, that the White House intends to confiscate guns--no manner of level of increased ATF officers could ever do that--why this mischaracterization is here. But listen to this. Gun rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the years that the Second Amendment they interpret means that they can buy any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. Well, basically, that does exist, except for the basic constraint of background checks, which now the President has expanded to ensure that if you are in a gun show--this is a gun show loophole--and you are sitting next to the stall of a licensed gun person and you are in the business of selling guns, why shouldn't you be either licensed or require, basically, background checks? But listen to this. In an ongoing legal battle in Florida, they lay claim to a newfangled Second Amendment right: the right not to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. Specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing guns or the potential harms that guns may cause with their patients. While mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the Constitution is on their side. Last month, for the third time in the same suit, a Federal court of appeals agreed. This is very bizarre. The case is filed under the name of Wollschlaeger v. Governor of the State of Florida, although First and Second Amendment buffs may recognize it under the cutesy nickname Docs v. Glocks. It started when some gun owners and the National Rifle Association told Florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking about gun safety--by asking about gun safety. The legislators responded by passing a law that bars healthcare workers from discussing or recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. Twelve other States are thinking about it, and now we have the Privacy of Firearm Owners Act. This is in the face of a number of homicides in this country. Let me cite to my colleagues that America is the number one country out of Western nations that has the highest number of cases of homicide by firearm per 100,000. The closest that comes to them is 0.7 by Italy. Then Taiwan, Canada, and Spain, 0.2; Germany, 0.2. All the news stories that we see on violent disruptions in various places and protests, their numbers of gun violence, of homicides, is miniscule: Australia, 0.1; UK, 0.1; France, 0.1; South Korea, 0.03; and finally Japan, 0.01. If that doesn't get our attention, I don't know what does. Then look at this map; 353 mass shootings in America in 2015. My colleague can see, is this anything to be proud of? Mass shootings not by knives, not by throwing stones, but by guns. This is what America is to the world: a sea of red of mass shootings, so much so that you can't even see background in some of the parts of this Nation. Yet there are laws that are being passed to stop health professionals from asking whether you have guns that might, in fact, endanger your children or yourselves. On average, more than 100,000 people in the United States are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes. More than 32,000 people die from gun violence, including 2,677 children under the age of 18. Gun deaths, justified versus criminal: studies also found that for every 1 justified homicide in the United States involving a gun, guns were used in 44 criminal homicides. In all of our communities, we see young Black men being felled by gun violence, young people in our communities being felled by gun violence, or innocent storekeepers being felled by gun violence, or in the instance of the Philadelphia police officer. All of us respect the dangers of law enforcement, recognizing that we can work together by building prepared and trained law enforcement officers to avoid the violence with guns. But in the instance of this individual, who point-blank shot at an officer with a gun, who has now been determined possibly to have heard voices, though he said he was inspired by ISIS, again, someone wanted to suggest that it wasn't anything that Obama could have done. It was a stolen police gun and it is out on the streets. Obviously, we don't have enough people enforcing against the trafficking of stolen guns. Mass shootings. The U.S. has a far higher number of mass shootings than any others I have indicated. Mental health. Approximately one in four American adults have a mental illness. Every time we hear of these mass shootings, the defense comes, which they have a right, to talk about this person's severe criminal mental illness condition. Guns in suicide is the leading cause of related deaths in America. More than 60 percent of deaths by guns in the country are the result of individuals using these weapons intending to commit suicide--not knives, not stones, not even poison or an overdose on drugs--guns. Guns and domestic violence provide a deadly outcome. Law enforcement killed by guns: each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives in gun violence having been shot to death while protecting their communities. Of course, we know that we have experienced tragic incidences under the authority of law where people have been killed, and the community is over the top in frustration. Background checks save lives. The tragedy at Mother Emanuel is the individual went to buy guns and the store owner said it is taking too long. I support President Obama's very astute and thoughtful approach. Out of that, I am very glad to have introduced two initiatives. One, H.R. 4315, Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act, which is a capture of President Obama's, along with Karen Bass. I urge my colleagues to sign on to H.R. 4315, which authorizes $500 million for health treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health information to the FBI background check system, NICS--not to violate the privacy, but to give more information to the database, because that certainly would be part of saving lives. As I conclude, H.R. 4316, that I am pleased to have Congresswoman Kelly join me in this, the Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act, authorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents, the very point of which my Republican friends are saying, but yet they are condemning what the President has offered. I would say to my colleagues in closing, if we don't do this for any other reason, to take and codify the President's initiatives on NICS or data collection, on research regarding safer guns, on background checks or closing the gun show loophole, if we don't do it, we should do it for the children. [[Page H271]] From December 2012 to December 2013, at least 100 children were killed in unintentional shootings, almost two every week, 61 percent higher than Federal data reflect. About two-thirds of these unintended deaths, at 65 percent, took place in the home or vehicle that belonged to the victim's family, most often with the guns that were legally owned but not secured. I remind you of that Supreme Court challenge or that law in Florida where doctors can't secure information to protect the patients or the children of these families. More than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them. I have introduced legislation on gun storage--I call it safety and responsibility--but yet, unfortunately, it is perceived as attacking the Second Amendment. My good friend from New York (Mr. Jeffries), let me thank you for yielding. Allow me to just leave us with the point that, as the Congressional Black Caucus stands on the floor, we need partners in doing the right thing. I hope before the President leaves office, he will have the opportunity to reasonably and rationally sign bills that will save lives. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Ending Gun Violence in America. Gun violence in America can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified. We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act. Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: to protect and defend the American people. This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem gun violence in our nation. Yet, after another mass shooting and countless acts of gun violence in communities across our country every day, House Republicans are still unwilling to act to stop gun violence and save lives in American communities. The Democrats have been calling for an immediate vote on the bipartisan King-Thompson Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act to strengthen the life-saving background checks that keep guns out of the wrong hands. This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the gun violence epidemic. Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the lives of Americans by taking common sense steps to save lives. The Administration has announced two new executive actions that will help strengthen the federal background check system and keep guns out of the wrong hands. I have introduced two bills that will hopefully enhance these executive actions and support the President's recently announced action on gun violence. H.R. 4315--Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act-- authorizes $500 million for mental health treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health information to the FBI's background check system NICS. H.R. 4316--Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act--authorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents and investigators for enforcement of existing gun laws. The President included these specific requests in yesterday's announcements and these bills respond to those requests. Additionally, the Department of justice (DOJ) is proposing a regulation to clarify who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law for reasons related to mental health. And the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a proposed regulation to address barriers preventing states from submitting limited information on those persons to the federal background check system. Ending gun violence in America requires a comprehensive approach--we must come together and work towards this common goal. Too many Americans have been severely injured or lost their lives as a result of gun violence. While the vast majority of Americans who experience a mental illness are not violent. However, in some cases when persons with a mental illness does not receive the treatment they need, the result can be tragedies such as homicide or suicide. We must continue to address mental health issues by: Supporting expanded coverage of mental health services and enhanced training and hiring of mental health professionals; and Continuing the national conversation on mental health to reduce stigma associated with having a mental illness and getting help; and We must also continue to do everything we can to making sure that anyone who may pose a danger to themselves or others does not have access to a gun. The federal background check system is one of the most effective ways of assuring that such individuals are not able to purchase a firearm from a licensed gun dealer. To date, background checks have prevented over two million guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Administration's two new executive actions will help ensure that better and more reliable information makes its way into the background check system. The Administration, however, has acknowledged the need for collective action and continues to call upon Members of Congress to pass common- sense gun safety legislation and to expand funding to increase access to mental health services. I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that will help stop the loss of innocent lives. While we have made some progress in strengthening the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to run background checks on those who buy guns from federally licensed gun dealers to make sure they are not prohibited by law from owning a firearm, we must do more. I am a strong supporter of a right of privacy and I am particularly sensitive and protective of patient privacy rights. I support the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that was passed by Congress in 1996, and includes privacy protection for medical records, which includes mental healthcare information. However, there are specific areas under federal law that allow the disclosure of medical information to authorities, and in these instances there should be an agreement that when a person poses a threat to themselves or others (as determined by a court or adjudicative authority with the medical and legal knowledge and authority to make a determination that a person poses a threat to themselves or to others) should not be allowed to purchase a fire arm. Technology that could be deployed to access court records and arrest records as they relate to mental health and violent behavior should not rely upon a list that may become out dated or could be used in ways that are not consistent with the intent of enhancing gun safety. The ability to access information that is accurate and available for the limited purpose of affirming or rejecting a request to purchase a firearm without indicating the source of the decision or the reason for the rejection would still protect privacy rights while also protecting the public. The president's proposal on mental health and gun violence is to enforce the laws already in place. Under a federal law enacted in 1968, an individual is prohibited from buying or possessing firearms for life if he/she has been ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' or ``committed to a mental institution.'' A person is ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' if a court--or other entity having legal authority to make adjudications--has made a determination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) Is a danger to himself or to others; 2) Lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs; 3) Is found insane by a court in a criminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. A person is ``committed to a mental institution'' if that person has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or other lawful authority. This expressly excludes voluntary commitment. It should be noted, however, that federal law currently allows states to establish procedures for mentally ill individuals to restore their right to possess and purchase firearms (many states have done so at the behest of the National Rifle Association, with questionable results). It is undoubtedly true that people who are a danger to self and/or others because of mental illness should be prohibited from owning firearms. It is less clear, however, how to tailor new policies to better protect the American public while at the same time avoiding the stigmatization of Americans with mental illness. Any strategy to address the lethal intersection between guns and mental illness should focus on the key facts: On average, more than 100,000 people in America are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes. More than 32,000 people die from gun violence annually, including 2,677 children under the age of eighteen years old. Suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in America. 60 percent of deaths by guns in America are the result of individuals using these weapons as a means to commit suicide. [[Page H272]] Some of these deaths might have been prevented if there were adequate background checks. Each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives to gun violence been shot to death protecting their communities. Millions of guns are sold every year in ``no questions asked'' transactions and experts estimate that 40 percent of guns now sold in America are done so without a background check. National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was created in 1998 to require potential gun buyers to pass an instant screening at the point of purchase. Ensures that purchasers are not felons, domestic abusers, mentally ill, etc. NICS has blocked sales to more than 2 million prohibited people. NICS stops 170 felons and 53 domestic abusers from purchasing guns every day. The most serious issue facing NICS is the ``private sale loophole''. This allows anyone who is not a federally-licensed dealer to sell guns without a background check. An estimated 40% of gun transfers--6.6 million transfers--are conducted without a background check. Armslist.com is the largest online seller of firearms. 66,000 gun ads are posted by private sellers on a given day, 750,000 per year. Nearly 1/3rd of gun ads on Armslist.com are posted by high-volume unlicensed sellers (approx. 4,218 people). High-volume sellers posted 29% of the gun ads. High-volume sellers posted 36,069 gun ads over 2 months. This would equate to around 243,800 guns each year by unlicensed sellers. 50% were familiar with federal laws but decided they didn't apply to them. 1/3rd of ``want-to-buy'' ads are posted by people with a criminal record. More than 4 times the rate at which prohibited gun buyers try to buy guns in stores. Approximately 25,000 guns are in illegal hands. [From Slate, Jan. 8, 2016] The Absurd Logic Behind Florida's Docs vs. Glocks Law The Second Amendment trumps all other amendments (By Dahlia Lithwick and Sonja West) Gun-rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the years about the broad scope of their constitutional rights. They say, in effect, that the Second Amendment means they can buy virtually any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. But in an ongoing legal battle in Florida, they lay claim to a newfangled Second Amendment right--the right not to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. Specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing guns, or the potential harms those guns may cause, with their patients. And while mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the Constitution is on their side. Last month, for the third time in the same suit, a federal court of appeals agreed. This very bizarre case is filed under the name of Wollschlaeger v. Governor of the State of Florida, although First and Second amendment buffs may recognize it under the cutesy nickname Docs vs. Glocks. It started when some gun owners (and the National Rifle Association) told Florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking about gun safety. The legislators responded by passing a law that bars health care workers from discussing or recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. (Twelve other states have considered enacting similar legislation, but only Florida has actually passed such a law.) The result was the Firearms Owners' Privacy Act. The law provides that licensed health care practitioners and facilities: ``may not intentionally enter'' information concerning a patient's ownership of firearms into the patient's medical record that the practitioner knows is ``not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others,'' and ``shall respect a patient's right to privacy and should refrain'' from inquiring as to whether a patient or their family owns firearms, unless the practitioner or facility believes in good faith that the ``information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.'' Violations of the act could lead to disciplinary action including fines and suspension, or revocation of a medical license. Proponents of such laws say these doctor-patient dialogues violate the patients' Second Amendment rights. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for the tremendous work you continue to do on the Judiciary Committee. I look forward to partnering with you. As you point out, the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms. It should not protect the ability of others to utilize weapons, often of mass destruction, in doing harm to Americans without a license or any legal bases for doing so. All we want is rational gun safety and gun violence prevention. I look forward to continuing to work with you in that regard. It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), one of my classmates. She has been a tremendous and forceful advocate for gun violence prevention measures, not only as the chair of the CBC Health Braintrust, for which she has been tireless on so many different issues, but also in her capacity within the House Democratic Caucus, as well as a chair of the CBC Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, someone who stood up countless times for the children in Chicago and the many others who have been dealing with unacceptable levels of gun violence. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank my good friends, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for this important Special Order hour tonight. Congressman Jeffries, you have chaired these Special Order hours for the Congressional Black Caucus in my first term, so it is good to see you back in the driver's seat with our classmate, Representative Beatty. Last year, I had the privilege of leading the Special Order hour with our colleague, the Honorable Donald Payne of New Jersey. In the course of that year, we came to this floor to reflect on gun violence on one too many occasions because it is an epidemic in communities across the country. In fact, we are 11 days into 2016, and there have already been 80 shootings in my hometown of Chicago. Four people were shot and killed in less than 24 hours. I applaud President Obama's bold executive action that has been talked about tonight. I believe these policies will keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous individuals. If you listen to some, they will say they are trying to take our guns. There is nothing in the executive action that says that. The opposition is pushing fear, not fact. With over 30 Americans killed by guns every single day inaction is not an option. {time} 2100 In my nearly 3 years in Congress, the majority party has refused to do anything on gun violence--not one hearing, not a single vote. To right what Congress has, unfortunately, made wrong, President Obama did what was necessary to address the threat to our long-term national security and economic stability. While we can't stop every criminal from committing every crime, we can take actions that will save lives. While President Obama's executive actions are crucial steps in reducing the senseless gun violence that is plaguing our Nation, they do not absolve Congress of its moral responsibility to act. There are gaps in existing gun laws that leave us all vulnerable to gun violence. These holes are ones that only Congress can plug. I have two commonsense bills that will complement President Obama's executive actions and that will help bring a reduction in firearm mortality. The first bill, H.R. 224, the Recognizing Gun Violence as a Public Health Emergency Act, would require the Surgeon General to submit an annual report to Congress on the public health impact of gun violence. The bill currently has 135 cosponsors, and I hope that this commonsense proposal can get an up-or-down vote this year. Also, I recently introduced H.R. 225, the Firearm Safety Act, which would close the loophole which prevents the Consumer Product Safety Commission from creating rules regarding the safety of firearms. Quite simply, if the Consumer Product Safety Commission can regulate teddy bears, bicycle helmets, and car seats, it should be able to regulate firearms. Simply improving safety lock quality and improving storage safety will reduce accidents, misfires, and will prevent theft, saving thousands of lives. Senseless gun violence has been plaguing our Nation for far too long. It is simply unacceptable in the United States of America that gun violence is the leading cause of death for people under 24. It is time for us to come together to end the gun violence that is [[Page H273]] taking a generation of young Americans. I often ask: Just how many and just who has to die before we take action? I urge my colleagues to attend a funeral to see and to feel the hurt and loss. Your standing for moments of silence and then your sitting in silence does nothing to deal with this issue. Let's stop the hypocrisy and take action and save lives. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman, my good friend from Illinois, for the very powerful presentation and for her steadfast leadership. Madam Speaker, one of the reasons we believe that Members of Congress need to act is that State laws are so inconsistent from one jurisdiction to the other. In New York, we experience gun violence in certain communities at unprecedented levels notwithstanding the fact that we have tremendously significant and robust gun violence prevention measures in place. But the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in the Brooklyn communities, represented by me and Yvette Clarke, actually come from the neighboring States of Pennsylvania as well as up the I-95 corridor from States in the Deep South. Chicago, as Robin Kelly has indicated, has been experiencing unprecedented levels of gun violence. Illinois actually has pretty robust gun safety-gun violence prevention laws on the books, but the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in Chicago come from the neighboring States of Indiana and Wisconsin, which have lax laws. Out in south central Los Angeles, the situation has gotten better over the last decade or so. California has pretty strong gun safety-gun violence prevention laws. The overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in south central Los Angeles and in east LA actually come from the neighboring State of Arizona. That is why we need Congress to act in order to deal with what is a national problem. Madam Speaker, it is now my great honor and privilege to yield to my good friend and colleague, my sister from the neighboring congressional district of mine and who has been such a forceful advocate on behalf of the communities that she represents in Brooklyn, the distinguished gentlewoman from the Ninth Congressional District of New York, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke. Ms. CLARKE of New York. Let me first start by thanking my brother from the neighboring district in Brooklyn, New York (Mr. Jeffries), alongside my sister from Ohio, Mrs. Joyce Beatty, for their leadership in our Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, discussing gun violence and gun safety measures. Let me also commend the Honorable Robin Kelly of Illinois for her leadership in doing the work that she is doing not only with our Health Braintrust, but by being an outspoken and forceful advocate for the end to gun violence not only for her district in Chicago, Illinois, but for all communities across this Nation. Madam Speaker, gun violence in the United States has reached epic proportions in the 21st century. The death, the trauma, the devastation that we are witnessing can no longer be tolerated. Congress must act now. Over the past decade in America, more than 100,000 people have been killed as a result of gun violence and millions more have been maimed by the reckless and unlawful discharging of firearms. I applaud President Barack Obama for taking this historic executive action to address gun violence in our Nation. These actions will save lives and will make America a safer place. The President's actions will strengthen lifesaving background checks, improve mental health services, and expand smart gun technology. We have all that we need in the United States to observe the Second Amendment rights of Americans and, at the same time, to take our Nation into the 21st century with responsible gun ownership that leaves little room for the illegal gun activity that we see taking place in terms of gun trafficking, in terms of the use of deadly arms in the hands of those who are unlicensed to hold them. As it relates to background checks, the proposals focus on new background check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the NICS, and the greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the State level. Specifically, it directs the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to obtain a Federal license to do so and to conduct background checks. It calls for the increased funding for the ATF in the hiring of 200 new ATF agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws, and it requires the ATF to issue a rule requiring background checks for the purchasers who purchase certain dangerous firearms and other items through a trust, a corporation, or other legal entity. It encourages greater communication between Federal and State authorities on criminal history information. What could be wrong with that? That is within the boundary of our laws, within our constitutional rights, and it makes our Nation safer. I come to this floor today as one who considers herself to be a victim of gun violence. We need to confront this right away because, for many in our communities, it is not only those who have been physically harmed by gun violence, but those who have been traumatized by being a witness to gun violence. I had the unfortunate privilege, if you will, of being in the Council Chambers of the New York City's City Council when my colleague, the Honorable James E. Davis, was gunned down before all of his colleagues--workplace domestic terrorism. That incident has been with me from that day forward. To this day, at a moment's notice, I can recall the trauma of that day, what it meant to see my colleague's life taken from him and to hear the gunplay that took place in the New York City Council's chambers. I am not alone. There are millions of Americans who are witnesses to gun violence or who may have been maimed by gun violence and who did not necessarily die as a result of it, but whose lives have been changed dramatically. We should not have another generation of Americans who can speak to the unspeakable horror of what it is to either be impacted directly in the loss of a loved one or to be the families who have to recount the times when they have had to be at the hospital with someone who is trying to recover from being gunned down. It is our obligation, our responsibility, as lawmakers for this Nation to get this right for future generations. So I applaud President Obama for doing what he could do within the parameters of his authority. It is now time for the United States House to do its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend and colleague for a very powerful presentation and for pointing out the sensibility of supporting all of the President's efforts, but particularly as they relate to the ATF, which is the Federal agency charged with enforcing our Nation's gun laws. Two hundred additional agents is the bare minimum that we can hire to make sure that the ATF has the manpower and resources necessary to prevent the illegal trafficking of guns into places like the Brownsville and East Flatbush neighborhoods that Congresswoman Yvette Clarke so passionately represents. If you block funding for the ATF, what you essentially are doing is supporting the efforts of the merchants of death who rely on underenforcement by the ATF, because of an absence of resources, in order to flood communities like Chicago; south central Los Angeles; parts of Brooklyn; Newark, New Jersey; and many other neighborhoods with illegal weapons. Madam Speaker, I yield to my good friend and colleague, Congressman Donald Payne. I thank him as well as R. Kelly. D. Payne and R. Kelly made a fantastic combination. We thank them for their distinguished service last year in leading the CBC Special Order hour. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PAYNE. Let me thank the gentleman from New York, who passed the baton to R. Kelly and me in 2015. We have rounded the corner and have put it back in his capable hands, along with our classmate's, the honorable [[Page H274]] gentlewoman from the great State of Ohio, Joyce Beatty, who is demonstrating day in and day out why she was such a great leader in the Ohio legislature. She has brought those talents to bear on the entire Nation. Madam Speaker, these are very serious times. I want to start out by commending the President of the United States, President Obama, in the face of insurmountable odds, for not being hampered in wanting to do something with this terrible, terrible scourge that we suffer from in this Nation. Gun violence impacts many different communities in this Nation, some more than others, but it impacts us all. I was proud to see the President step forward and not be hampered in doing something. If the obstructionists on the other side of the aisle want to continue in that manner, then let them be, but he was going to do something. I also commend my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for uniting with the President in this great effort. We understand in our communities what this means. We are trying to articulate it to the American people, but we understand it. We live it. We feel it. We see it. {time} 2115 The President's executive actions on gun control are a step in the right direction, but it is the responsibility of Congress to pass gun reform that makes our communities safer. I have joined, along with Robin Kelly, who mentioned two pieces of her legislation in terms of gun control--after Sandy Hook several years ago, I proposed a piece of legislation that did not really see the light of day. Since the President has not given up on this effort, I will not either. I have a piece of legislation, which is called the Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act. It would keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people by creating a voluntary Federal gun buyback program. Under my bill, State and local governments, as well as gun dealers, would distribute smart, prepaid debit cards to gun owners in exchange for their firearms. My bill incentivizes gun owners to voluntarily get guns off the streets. This will make our communities safer for our children, family, and our businesses. Commonsense proposals like my bill are critical to ending our Nation's epidemic of gun violence. This epidemic impacts every community in America, including in my district. Last year in the city of Newark shootings increased 19 percent from 2014 and homicides rose by 8 percent. In 2015, there were at least 76 gun deaths in my district. One-third of all of the gun deaths in New Jersey last year happened in my district. Gun violence has had a disproportionate impact within the African American community and other urban areas. That is clear when you look at what is happening in my district and throughout other African American communities in New Jersey. We need a Federal approach to gun violence because it is a problem across State lines. Case in point, New Jersey is a net importer of crime guns. In other words, more illegal weapons confiscated by law enforcement came from out of the State than there were purchased from in the State. Reducing gun violence is vital to the safety and security of American communities. My colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle should drop the politics and pandering. They should instead join with Democrats in supporting the President and his commonsense reforms and, like my gun buyback program, to address gun tragedies in all communities. Let me just say, Madam Speaker, no one wants to take guns away from anyone. We understand the laws and liberties that have made this Nation great. If we don't do something in reference to gun control, then it is shame on us. Mr. JEFFRIES. I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), a dynamic new Member of the House. Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our President's actions toward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to end up in the hands of people that shouldn't have them. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty, for bringing this hour here in Congress. I am thankful for the Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour for taking time to educate the American people of the importance of our President's action. While this Congress and, in particular, our Republican colleagues have hemmed and dithered and engaged in political inertia and, at the end, failed to act in this matter, suspected terrorists are free to legally purchase combat-style weapons. American cities and other areas of this country are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, guns cause twice as many deaths in young people as cancer, 5 times as many as heart disease, and 15 times as many as infections. Yet, we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we spend hundreds of millions researching and mitigating the effects of those other maladies. Every day this Congress fails to act more American families mourn, more American lives are cut short, many in their prime, and more American cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics. Even in America's paradise, my home district of the United States Virgin Islands, this is so. In 2015, there were 40 homicides in the U.S. Virgin Islands. On a per capita basis, that homicide rate is more than double that of the city of Chicago. Gun violence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and in other places, along with the United States Virgin Islands, sadly are a near daily occurrence. While we pause for moments of silence after mass shootings like the ones in Newtown or San Bernardino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized. While the President's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know that communities like our own and the many other minority communities across this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence. I want to ask that this Congress act on these things. This Congress has in its power the ability to save thousands of lives. Let us not allow the nearly daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new norm. We must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation in this Congress this year. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the President's action toward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to end up in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. While this Congress fails to act on this matter, suspected terrorists are free to legally purchase combat-style weapons, American cities are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, guns cause twice as many deaths in young people as cancer, five times as many as heart disease and 15 times as many as infections. Yet we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we spend hundreds-of-millions researching and mitigating the affects of those maladies. Every day this Congress fails to act, more American families mourn: more American lives are cut short--many in their prime--and more American cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics. Even in America's paradise: my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 2015, there were 40 homicides in the U.S. Virgin Islands. That's a per capita homicide rate more than double that of the city of Chicago. Gun violence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and the U.S. Virgin Islands, sadly, are a near daily occurrence. And while we pause for moments of silence after mass shootings like the one in New Town or San Bernadino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized. There were 353 mass shootings in this country in 2015--three of which occurred in my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands. One occurred on a crowded boardwalk on a beautiful day in May. The second mass shooting took place in a housing community, where children played just after 5 p.m. one afternoon this past September. The third took place on a busy highway two days after Thanksgiving. A mass shooting occurs just about everyday in this country, yet there are no moments of silence or thoughts and prayers extended to many of the victims. [[Page H275]] While the President's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know that in communities like the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the many other minority communities across this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence. The citizens living in these communities experience inexcusable levels of poverty. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, more than 30 percent of children are living below the poverty level and in Chicago, most of the South and West sides have 40 to 60 percent of residents living below the poverty level. If we are serious about making our communities safer and reducing gun crime, we must take comprehensive action to not only reduce the likelihood of mass shootings like San Bernadino or New Town, but also address the systemic divestment of resources, education, support in communities of color across this country that lead the scourge of gun violence that play out on our inner-city streets everyday. In addition to The President's action, this congress needs to make it a priority to make adequate investments in early childhood education and other programs aimed at lifting children out of poverty. Additionally, making meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system and increasing resources to reduce the flow of drugs and illegal guns through our ports will help fight back the firearm black market. This is not about the second amendment: an overwhelming number of Americans--most gun owners themselves--agree, that we must do something to stop guns from getting into the hands of people who shouldn't have them. This Congress has in its power, the ability to save thousands of lives. Let us not allow the near daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new norm. We must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, last week, President Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence across the United States. President Obama laid out these much-needed steps in the face of Congressional inaction, which will help to reduce the senseless gun violence that affects countless communities across our nation. In 2014, firearms claimed the lives of more than 33,000 Americans. Over 2,800 of those fatalities took place in my home state of Texas. Perhaps there will be a time when we no longer will have to read headlines about mass murders in our schools or movie theaters. But until then, our nation must take concerted steps to strengthen background checks, improve mental health services, and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. This is what President Obama has sought to achieve and I truly believe that this can be done without infringing on law-abiding citizens' right to bear arms. There have been numerous critics of President Obama's executive actions to reduce gun violence. However, we can no longer stand by as gun violence claims the lives of more innocent Americans. The President is limited in what he can achieve through executive actions alone. That is why Congress has the responsibility to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation now and put our nation on the path to preventing such violence from happening again. Mr. Speaker, gun violence affects individuals of all backgrounds in communities all across the United States. It is not a Democratic issue nor is it a Republican issue. It is an issue that affects every American in one form or another. Successfully reducing gun violence in this country will take more than just legislative action from Congress. It will take the collective effort of every American to change the course of our history and end gun violence in America once and for all.

representative joyce beatty, this cbc special order hour, this hour of power. once again, we are privileged to take to the floor of the people's house to discuss an issue that should be relevant to every member of this institution on behalf of the 320 million-plus americans that we represent in this great country, and that is the gun violence epidemic. america has 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns. it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns in circulation throughout this country. so it seems to me reasonable that we would do everything possible to ensure that not a single one of those guns finds themselves in the hands of individuals who would do us harm. and that in many ways is what president obama has done as it relates to his most recent executive action. so today members of the congressional black caucus will come to the house floor to discuss those executive actions, discuss the issue of gun violence, discuss the steps that we should be taking, here in this chamber, in order to keep the people of america that we all collectively represent safe. it is now my honor and my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty), my classmate and my co-anchor for this cbc special order hour. i look forward to anchoring with her throughout the entire year. she has been a tremendous champion for working families, for the middle class, for small-business owners and, of course, for the young people who are ravaged in our communities all across this country by gun violence. mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, i rise this evening proud to stand with my congressional black caucus special order hour co-anchor, congressman jeffries, from the eighth congressional district of new york. mr. jeffries, it is my honor to stand here today as we undertake an urgent dialogue on how we, as elected representatives of the people, can work together to end gun violence. i look forward to engaging with congressman jeffries and our congressional black caucus colleagues in scholarly debate on the issues plaguing african americans, african american communities, and to develop solutions to the problems our constituents face. as the conscience of the congress, the congressional black caucus will remain on the forefront of issues that affect black americans in particular, and the nation, in general. for tonight, our anchor, congressman jeffries, has pointed out the cbc will continue to shed light on the epidemic of gun violence, standing our ground, ending gun violence in america. mr. speaker, last week we opened the second session of the 114th congress. four hundred thirty-five of us traveled back to washington ready to serve our constituents and work for the betterment of our nation. unfortunately, mr. speaker, whatever spirit of bipartisanship may have been present at the end of 2015 as republicans and democrats worked together on key pieces of legislation has disappeared at the precise time our nation is calling on congress to pass commonsense legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. we find ourselves confronted with startling statistics that no nation should endure. let me just take a moment to share just a few. we know that the impact of gun violence affects every community and every congressional district. however, african american children and teens are 17 times more likely to die from gun homicide than white youth, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. while african americans make up 15 percent of youth in america, african americans accounted for 45 percent of children and teen gun deaths in 2010. according to everytown for gun safety, 88 americans die every day from gun violence, mr. speaker. roughly 50 percent of those killed are african american men, who comprise just 6 percent of the population. homicide is the primary cause of death among african americans ages 15- 24. mr. speaker, these numbers should be unthinkable, unimaginable, but they are the unfortunate reality in which african american communities live. in the words of dr. martin luther king, whose legacy we honor next monday, he said: we find ourselves ``confronted with the fierce urgency of now.'' and mr. speaker, it is now that our nation is in an urgent crisis, yet we are trapped in congressional inaction. shameful. so our president decided he would not stand by idly while congress did nothing to prevent another newtown, another charleston, other tucson. with tears in his eyes, he reflected on the senseless killings caused by gun violence over the course of his administration. president obama announced new executive actions to confront the epidemic of gun violence in america. while mocked by some republicans for showing emotion at the loss of so many lives, i am here to say i proudly stand with my president on the actions he has taken to prevent gun violence in america. these executive actions will save lives and make the country safer without infringing on law-abiding individuals' rights to firearms. you will hear from our colleagues tonight talking about the president's actions. i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and to address gun violence. mr. jeffries. thank you, representative beatty, for laying out the case in such an eloquent and compelling fashion, and pointing out that, with respect to gun safety and gun violence prevention in america, it is long past time when we act with the fierce urgency of now. tens of thousands of americans have died as a result of gun violence since the moment you and i first set foot in this institution, and not a single thing has been done by the house of representatives to prevent those deaths. that is shameful, as you have pointed out, and we need a change of course. mr. speaker, i yield to the distinguished gentleman from virginia (mr. scott), the ranking member, lead democrat on the house education and the workforce committee, once, of course, chaired by the legendary adam clayton powell, and representative scott has continued in that tremendous visionary tradition. mr. scott of virginia. mr. speaker, i want to thank the gentleman from new york and the gentlewoman from ohio for organizing tonight's special order to focus on the toll that gun violence has taken on communities across america and, especially, the disproportionate impact it has had within communities of color. tonight's conversation comes at an important time. on average, every day more than 30 people are killed by firearms, many in mass murders. now, rather than do what they say is celebrate the problem, i want to talk about solutions. last tuesday, the president announced the executive actions that his administration will take [[page h268]] to prevent gun violence. i commend the president for taking this action, in light of the current congressional leadership's refusal to responsibly address this epidemic. these executive actions will ensure stronger enforcement of current laws and will reduce the number of lives lost to gun violence. to begin with, the president's executive actions will narrow the ``gun show'' and internet loopholes by actually enforcing licensing requirements for gun dealers and overhauling the background check system to make it more effective and efficient. under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform criminal background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be ``engaged in the business'' of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, the atf. the executive actions make it clear that the commonsense proposition that anyone making a profit from the sale of guns, or who regularly makes gun sales or earns a livelihood from gun sales, is, in fact, engaged in the business and therefore must obtain a license and conduct required criminal background checks, even if those sales occur at gun shows or over the internet. {time} 2030 the question of whether someone is engaged in business will be determined by normal legal standards as opposed to people just declaring themselves to be exempt, which is going on now. some of these people are even making a living selling firearms. they need to get a license. this is the present law, and the president has said that he will enforce it. the federal bureau of investigation, as part of executive actions, will overhaul its national instant criminal background check system, the nics system, to make it more effective and efficient by hiring more than 230 additional examiners and other staff so that the bureau can process background checks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and improve its notification of local authorities when prohibited persons unlawfully attempt to purchase a gun. these people are currently breaking the law when they illegally try to buy a firearm, and local law enforcement officials need to be informed. according to the bureau of justice statistics, this system has already caught more than 2 million people trying to buy guns illegally, and they need to be held accountable for breaking the law. furthermore, dealers will also be required to notify law enforcement if their guns are lost or stolen in transit. this transparency and accountability will ensure that law enforcement will be notified and can begin investigations when these losses occur. executive actions will also leverage the buying power of the department of defense, the department of justice, and the department of homeland security to conduct or sponsor research into gun technology. when the federal government begins buying guns using that kind of technology, it will make it more likely that this technology will be used. there is technology that makes it impossible for anyone other than the true owner to use weapons, and the more purchases the federal government makes, the more likely it is that technology will actually be installed in future weapons. the president has also directed the departments to review the availability of smart gun technology on a regular basis and to explore potential ways to further its use and to encourage research to more broadly improve gun safety. the president's plan also proposes a new $500 million investment to increase access to mental health treatment to ensure that people who need help do not fall through the cracks of the mental health system. this is in addition to the huge increases in mental health funding under the affordable care act. mental health services are considered essential services, and so now virtually all health insurance policies include mental health coverage. while modest and within the president's executive authority, these executive actions will go a long way in keeping guns out of the hands of people who never should be able to purchase them in the first place. but that is executive action. congress needs to act so that more can be done to actually protect citizens from gun violence. the house democratic gun violence prevention task force has consistently reiterated that washington has a moral obligation to do something to address our nation's gun violence epidemic. the most effective way to address this epidemic is through comprehensive, evidence-based policy proposals. our task force has put forth several proposals that will go a long way in achieving these goals. these proposals include reinstating and strengthening the assault weapon ban, reducing the size of magazines, implementing universal background checks, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and straw purchases, improving our mental health system, and implementing comprehensive, locally tailored, evidence-based violence prevention and intervention programs. the gentleman from california, representative mike thompson, is the chair of the house democratic gun violence prevention task force, and he has introduced a resolution to establish a select committee of the house to study gun violence. that resolution is cosponsored by democratic leader nancy pelosi and 11 cochairs of the task force. the proposed select committee would be comprised of six republicans and six democrats who would study the research and issue a final report and recommendations, including legislative proposals, within 60 days of its establishment. it would study and make recommendations to address many issues, including the causes of mass shootings, methods to improve the federal firearms purchaser background check system, connections between access to firearms and dangerously mentally ill individuals, federal penalties for trafficking and straw purchasing of firearms, loopholes that allow some domestic abusers continued access to firearms, linkages between firearms and suicide, gun violence's effect on public health, the correlation between state gun violence prevention laws and the incidence of gun violence, the importance of having reliable, accurate information on gun violence and its toll on our nation, the implementation of effective gun violence prevention laws in accordance with the second amendment to our constitution, and the rates of gun violence in large metropolitan areas. mr. speaker, by taking a deliberate, research-based approach to gun violence, treating it as we would a public health challenge, we can significantly reduce the ravages of gun violence. the president is limited by his executive authority on what alone he can do to address this epidemic. long-term reforms can only be achieved through congressional action. i hope that the leadership of the congress will follow the president's lead and act in a bipartisan basis to address this critical issue using public health strategies and evidence-based proposals. again, mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from new york and the gentlelady from ohio for coordinating this special order. mr. jeffries. thank you, representative scott, for laying out the steps that are being taken by the president in such a compelling way in explaining why they are items that we should all support as well as some of the steps that need to be taken legislatively by this congress in order to deal with the fact that more than 10,000 americans a year die as a result of gun violence-related homicides. i yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from california (ms. lee). she is an incredibly eloquent and passionate voice for the voiceless. we appreciate her service here in the congress not just on behalf of the district that she represents in northern california, but certainly on behalf of the people of the united states of america. i yield now to congresswoman barbara lee. ms. lee. first, let me thank the gentleman from new york for those very kind remarks. but also i want to thank you and congresswoman beatty for organizing this very important special order and for your tremendous leadership, congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty, on ensuring public safety. your leadership, both congresswoman beatty and congressman [[page h269]] jeffries, has been bold, it has been visionary, not just as the result of the very recent tragedies but for many, many years even before both of you came to congress. so it is an honor serving with both of you in this body. thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening. also, i want to just thank congresswoman robin kelly, who is the vice chair on the gun violence task force. she also chairs the cbc's health braintrust. i thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem, which it is. madam speaker, i rise this evening with my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to call on congress to do something--to do something--about the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities. since the start of the year--just 11 days ago--nine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence, including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller. just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides. my thoughts are with the victims' family at this very terribly difficult time. we have to do something. enough is enough. congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence. whether it is charleston, oak creek, sandy hook, the streets of oakland or wherever, too many people have already lost their lives, too many families have buried loved ones, and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence. madam speaker, now is the time for action. our constituents are demanding action. the country is demanding action. i have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents, and i know other members are also hearing from their constituents. they are calling for action as well. earlier today in my own district, oakland city council president lynette gibson mcelehany buried her grandson, 17-year-old torian hughes, who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before christmas. this has been a very difficult period for council member mcelehany and her family. so in addition to our prayers not only for my council member's family, but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence, we must do something. we must do something in all of their memory. let me be clear. congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents, their families, and communities. last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of americans in applauding president obama's actions to reduce gun violence in our nation. thanks to the president's leadership, there will be more background checks, better enforcement of existing gun laws, improved mental health services, and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence. but more action is needed to stop the more than 30,000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year. congress must pass commonsense gun reform, like closing the gun show loophole, bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans and gun owners. congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services. but this should not be an excuse, of course, to do nothing on gun safety. we have got to provide the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nation's gun laws. as a member of the appropriations committee, i have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe. we must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcement's ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue. that is why i introduced last year h.r. 1449, the tiahrt restrictions repeal act, which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks. these data restrictions are commonly called the tiahrt restrictions. they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public. these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyed--mind you, destroyed--within 24 hours, prohibiting the atf from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers. this is outrageous. we have got to restrict and repeal these tiahrt amendments right away. it will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals. it is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes. the tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers, law enforcement, and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community. of course, many of us are proud to support congresswoman kelly's bill, which would allow the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue and the consumer product safety commission to regulate firearms. madam speaker, the time for action is now. let's start listening to the american people and insist that congress do something. it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this body--for years--to get these sensible bills passed. the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that congress can act. no more excuses. we should support congressman thompson's proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence. the speaker should do this now. so we can't continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about congress. we need to do our job. we have been trying, many of us, the congressional black caucus and others, especially democrats, for many years to try to get the speaker to bring these bills to the floor. so what did the president do? he had to do something. but no more excuses. congress needs to act. so i thank congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries for this very important special order hour and for your tremendous leadership. mr. jeffries. again, i thank the distinguished gentlewoman from california for her wonderful remarks, observations, and, of course, her support for the president's executive actions on gun safety, making it clear that the president was left with no choice but to act. tens of thousands of americans die each and every year either as it relates to homicide or suicide through a firearm, and nothing was happening here in the united states congress. the classic definition of legislative insanity is to do the same exact thing, which in this instance is nothing, and expect that things were going to change for the safety and the well-being of the american people. that is why we are here on the floor today expressing strong support for the president's executive actions and pushing this institution to do more and finish the job that the president of the united states of america started. {time} 2045 it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from houston (ms. jackson lee), a forceful advocate and the lead democrat on the relevant committee on the house judiciary side of the equation as it relates to criminal justice, reform, and gun safety. she, of course, has been a tremendous champion for the people that she serves down in h-town, as well as across the country. ms. jackson lee. let me thank the gentleman from new york for yielding. as has been stated by my colleagues, i want to add my applause as well for the thoughtfulness of the gentleman's leadership on a number of issues, but certainly on his pronounced leadership on criminal justice reform and on the judiciary committee; and then to be joined by former leader of the ohio state legislature--and she has not forgotten her talents of leadership--and that is congresswoman joyce beatty who joins us, if i might put words in both your mouths, with a sense of outrage about where we are today. i say that because i would like to stand here [[page h270]] with an enormous amount of outrage for where we are and why we are here. i want to add my appreciation to the congressional black caucus, the chairman, mr. butterfield, and, of course, congresswoman dr. kelly, who has been a great leader on the issues dealing with health care. i just want to cite to her, a lady that came to this congress more than a decade ago, deborah prothrow-stith. you may have read her writings. she pronounced during that time that gun violence was a health crisis. that was so many years ago. unfortunately, with all of her expert writings, we still couldn't get movement. i am going to take a slightly different perspective. if i could just take these few moments to give you an anecdotal story, which many of you might find absolutely with a great deal of shock, if you will. that is the limit to which gun rights advocates mislead the american people on any ideas for gun safety or gun regulation as taking guns away. i was in a meeting where someone was trying to understand why president obama in his excellent presentation about securing america and protecting our children from gun violence was being associated with the idea of taking over 345 million guns. this is what is represented to be president obama's message. he will confiscate, through his process of gun testing or making sure that there are background checks for everyone, that he wants to confiscate 345 million guns, which has been determined to be located in 65 million places here in the united states. can i, in a public forum on this august floor of the house, say that we, as members of congress--and i think republicans will admit this-- have no evidence, no documentation, that the white house intends to confiscate guns--no manner of level of increased atf officers could ever do that--why this mischaracterization is here. but listen to this. gun rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the years that the second amendment they interpret means that they can buy any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. well, basically, that does exist, except for the basic constraint of background checks, which now the president has expanded to ensure that if you are in a gun show--this is a gun show loophole--and you are sitting next to the stall of a licensed gun person and you are in the business of selling guns, why shouldn't you be either licensed or require, basically, background checks? but listen to this. in an ongoing legal battle in florida, they lay claim to a newfangled second amendment right: the right not to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing guns or the potential harms that guns may cause with their patients. while mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the constitution is on their side. last month, for the third time in the same suit, a federal court of appeals agreed. this is very bizarre. the case is filed under the name of wollschlaeger v. governor of the state of florida, although first and second amendment buffs may recognize it under the cutesy nickname docs v. glocks. it started when some gun owners and the national rifle association told florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking about gun safety--by asking about gun safety. the legislators responded by passing a law that bars healthcare workers from discussing or recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. twelve other states are thinking about it, and now we have the privacy of firearm owners act. this is in the face of a number of homicides in this country. let me cite to my colleagues that america is the number one country out of western nations that has the highest number of cases of homicide by firearm per 100,000. the closest that comes to them is 0.7 by italy. then taiwan, canada, and spain, 0.2; germany, 0.2. all the news stories that we see on violent disruptions in various places and protests, their numbers of gun violence, of homicides, is miniscule: australia, 0.1; uk, 0.1; france, 0.1; south korea, 0.03; and finally japan, 0.01. if that doesn't get our attention, i don't know what does. then look at this map; 353 mass shootings in america in 2015. my colleague can see, is this anything to be proud of? mass shootings not by knives, not by throwing stones, but by guns. this is what america is to the world: a sea of red of mass shootings, so much so that you can't even see background in some of the parts of this nation. yet there are laws that are being passed to stop health professionals from asking whether you have guns that might, in fact, endanger your children or yourselves. on average, more than 100,000 people in the united states are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes. more than 32,000 people die from gun violence, including 2,677 children under the age of 18. gun deaths, justified versus criminal: studies also found that for every 1 justified homicide in the united states involving a gun, guns were used in 44 criminal homicides. in all of our communities, we see young black men being felled by gun violence, young people in our communities being felled by gun violence, or innocent storekeepers being felled by gun violence, or in the instance of the philadelphia police officer. all of us respect the dangers of law enforcement, recognizing that we can work together by building prepared and trained law enforcement officers to avoid the violence with guns. but in the instance of this individual, who point-blank shot at an officer with a gun, who has now been determined possibly to have heard voices, though he said he was inspired by isis, again, someone wanted to suggest that it wasn't anything that obama could have done. it was a stolen police gun and it is out on the streets. obviously, we don't have enough people enforcing against the trafficking of stolen guns. mass shootings. the u.s. has a far higher number of mass shootings than any others i have indicated. mental health. approximately one in four american adults have a mental illness. every time we hear of these mass shootings, the defense comes, which they have a right, to talk about this person's severe criminal mental illness condition. guns in suicide is the leading cause of related deaths in america. more than 60 percent of deaths by guns in the country are the result of individuals using these weapons intending to commit suicide--not knives, not stones, not even poison or an overdose on drugs--guns. guns and domestic violence provide a deadly outcome. law enforcement killed by guns: each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives in gun violence having been shot to death while protecting their communities. of course, we know that we have experienced tragic incidences under the authority of law where people have been killed, and the community is over the top in frustration. background checks save lives. the tragedy at mother emanuel is the individual went to buy guns and the store owner said it is taking too long. i support president obama's very astute and thoughtful approach. out of that, i am very glad to have introduced two initiatives. one, h.r. 4315, mental health access and gun violence prevention act, which is a capture of president obama's, along with karen bass. i urge my colleagues to sign on to h.r. 4315, which authorizes $500 million for health treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health information to the fbi background check system, nics--not to violate the privacy, but to give more information to the database, because that certainly would be part of saving lives. as i conclude, h.r. 4316, that i am pleased to have congresswoman kelly join me in this, the gun violence reduction resources act, authorizes the hiring of 200 additional atf agents, the very point of which my republican friends are saying, but yet they are condemning what the president has offered. i would say to my colleagues in closing, if we don't do this for any other reason, to take and codify the president's initiatives on nics or data collection, on research regarding safer guns, on background checks or closing the gun show loophole, if we don't do it, we should do it for the children. [[page h271]] from december 2012 to december 2013, at least 100 children were killed in unintentional shootings, almost two every week, 61 percent higher than federal data reflect. about two-thirds of these unintended deaths, at 65 percent, took place in the home or vehicle that belonged to the victim's family, most often with the guns that were legally owned but not secured. i remind you of that supreme court challenge or that law in florida where doctors can't secure information to protect the patients or the children of these families. more than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them. i have introduced legislation on gun storage--i call it safety and responsibility--but yet, unfortunately, it is perceived as attacking the second amendment. my good friend from new york (mr. jeffries), let me thank you for yielding. allow me to just leave us with the point that, as the congressional black caucus stands on the floor, we need partners in doing the right thing. i hope before the president leaves office, he will have the opportunity to reasonably and rationally sign bills that will save lives. mr. speaker, i am pleased to join my colleagues of the congressional black caucus, congressman hakeem jeffries (d-ny) and congresswoman joyce beatty (d-oh) who are anchoring this special order on ending gun violence in america. gun violence in america can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored or irrationally justified. we are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act. upon taking office, every member of congress makes a solemn pledge: to protect and defend the american people. this is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to honor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem gun violence in our nation. yet, after another mass shooting and countless acts of gun violence in communities across our country every day, house republicans are still unwilling to act to stop gun violence and save lives in american communities. the democrats have been calling for an immediate vote on the bipartisan king-thompson public safety and second amendment rights protection act to strengthen the life-saving background checks that keep guns out of the wrong hands. this congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the gun violence epidemic. now is the time for republicans to join democrats in protecting the lives of americans by taking common sense steps to save lives. the administration has announced two new executive actions that will help strengthen the federal background check system and keep guns out of the wrong hands. i have introduced two bills that will hopefully enhance these executive actions and support the president's recently announced action on gun violence. h.r. 4315--mental health access and gun violence prevention act-- authorizes $500 million for mental health treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health information to the fbi's background check system nics. h.r. 4316--gun violence reduction resources act--authorizes the hiring of 200 additional atf agents and investigators for enforcement of existing gun laws. the president included these specific requests in yesterday's announcements and these bills respond to those requests. additionally, the department of justice (doj) is proposing a regulation to clarify who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law for reasons related to mental health. and the department of health and human services (hhs) is issuing a proposed regulation to address barriers preventing states from submitting limited information on those persons to the federal background check system. ending gun violence in america requires a comprehensive approach--we must come together and work towards this common goal. too many americans have been severely injured or lost their lives as a result of gun violence. while the vast majority of americans who experience a mental illness are not violent. however, in some cases when persons with a mental illness does not receive the treatment they need, the result can be tragedies such as homicide or suicide. we must continue to address mental health issues by: supporting expanded coverage of mental health services and enhanced training and hiring of mental health professionals; and continuing the national conversation on mental health to reduce stigma associated with having a mental illness and getting help; and we must also continue to do everything we can to making sure that anyone who may pose a danger to themselves or others does not have access to a gun. the federal background check system is one of the most effective ways of assuring that such individuals are not able to purchase a firearm from a licensed gun dealer. to date, background checks have prevented over two million guns from falling into the wrong hands. the administration's two new executive actions will help ensure that better and more reliable information makes its way into the background check system. the administration, however, has acknowledged the need for collective action and continues to call upon members of congress to pass common- sense gun safety legislation and to expand funding to increase access to mental health services. i too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation that will help stop the loss of innocent lives. while we have made some progress in strengthening the national instant criminal background check system (nics), which is used to run background checks on those who buy guns from federally licensed gun dealers to make sure they are not prohibited by law from owning a firearm, we must do more. i am a strong supporter of a right of privacy and i am particularly sensitive and protective of patient privacy rights. i support the health insurance portability and accountability act that was passed by congress in 1996, and includes privacy protection for medical records, which includes mental healthcare information. however, there are specific areas under federal law that allow the disclosure of medical information to authorities, and in these instances there should be an agreement that when a person poses a threat to themselves or others (as determined by a court or adjudicative authority with the medical and legal knowledge and authority to make a determination that a person poses a threat to themselves or to others) should not be allowed to purchase a fire arm. technology that could be deployed to access court records and arrest records as they relate to mental health and violent behavior should not rely upon a list that may become out dated or could be used in ways that are not consistent with the intent of enhancing gun safety. the ability to access information that is accurate and available for the limited purpose of affirming or rejecting a request to purchase a firearm without indicating the source of the decision or the reason for the rejection would still protect privacy rights while also protecting the public. the president's proposal on mental health and gun violence is to enforce the laws already in place. under a federal law enacted in 1968, an individual is prohibited from buying or possessing firearms for life if he/she has been ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' or ``committed to a mental institution.'' a person is ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' if a court--or other entity having legal authority to make adjudications--has made a determination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) is a danger to himself or to others; 2) lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs; 3) is found insane by a court in a criminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the uniform code of military justice. a person is ``committed to a mental institution'' if that person has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or other lawful authority. this expressly excludes voluntary commitment. it should be noted, however, that federal law currently allows states to establish procedures for mentally ill individuals to restore their right to possess and purchase firearms (many states have done so at the behest of the national rifle association, with questionable results). it is undoubtedly true that people who are a danger to self and/or others because of mental illness should be prohibited from owning firearms. it is less clear, however, how to tailor new policies to better protect the american public while at the same time avoiding the stigmatization of americans with mental illness. any strategy to address the lethal intersection between guns and mental illness should focus on the key facts: on average, more than 100,000 people in america are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes. more than 32,000 people die from gun violence annually, including 2,677 children under the age of eighteen years old. suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in america. 60 percent of deaths by guns in america are the result of individuals using these weapons as a means to commit suicide. [[page h272]] some of these deaths might have been prevented if there were adequate background checks. each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives to gun violence been shot to death protecting their communities. millions of guns are sold every year in ``no questions asked'' transactions and experts estimate that 40 percent of guns now sold in america are done so without a background check. national instant criminal background check system (nics) was created in 1998 to require potential gun buyers to pass an instant screening at the point of purchase. ensures that purchasers are not felons, domestic abusers, mentally ill, etc. nics has blocked sales to more than 2 million prohibited people. nics stops 170 felons and 53 domestic abusers from purchasing guns every day. the most serious issue facing nics is the ``private sale loophole''. this allows anyone who is not a federally-licensed dealer to sell guns without a background check. an estimated 40% of gun transfers--6.6 million transfers--are conducted without a background check. armslist.com is the largest online seller of firearms. 66,000 gun ads are posted by private sellers on a given day, 750,000 per year. nearly 1/3rd of gun ads on armslist.com are posted by high-volume unlicensed sellers (approx. 4,218 people). high-volume sellers posted 29% of the gun ads. high-volume sellers posted 36,069 gun ads over 2 months. this would equate to around 243,800 guns each year by unlicensed sellers. 50% were familiar with federal laws but decided they didn't apply to them. 1/3rd of ``want-to-buy'' ads are posted by people with a criminal record. more than 4 times the rate at which prohibited gun buyers try to buy guns in stores. approximately 25,000 guns are in illegal hands. [from slate, jan. 8, 2016] the absurd logic behind florida's docs vs. glocks law the second amendment trumps all other amendments (by dahlia lithwick and sonja west) gun-rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the years about the broad scope of their constitutional rights. they say, in effect, that the second amendment means they can buy virtually any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. but in an ongoing legal battle in florida, they lay claim to a newfangled second amendment right--the right not to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing guns, or the potential harms those guns may cause, with their patients. and while mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the constitution is on their side. last month, for the third time in the same suit, a federal court of appeals agreed. this very bizarre case is filed under the name of wollschlaeger v. governor of the state of florida, although first and second amendment buffs may recognize it under the cutesy nickname docs vs. glocks. it started when some gun owners (and the national rifle association) told florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking about gun safety. the legislators responded by passing a law that bars health care workers from discussing or recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. (twelve other states have considered enacting similar legislation, but only florida has actually passed such a law.) the result was the firearms owners' privacy act. the law provides that licensed health care practitioners and facilities: ``may not intentionally enter'' information concerning a patient's ownership of firearms into the patient's medical record that the practitioner knows is ``not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others,'' and ``shall respect a patient's right to privacy and should refrain'' from inquiring as to whether a patient or their family owns firearms, unless the practitioner or facility believes in good faith that the ``information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.'' violations of the act could lead to disciplinary action including fines and suspension, or revocation of a medical license. proponents of such laws say these doctor-patient dialogues violate the patients' second amendment rights. mr. jeffries. i thank the distinguished gentlewoman for the tremendous work you continue to do on the judiciary committee. i look forward to partnering with you. as you point out, the second amendment protects the right to bear arms. it should not protect the ability of others to utilize weapons, often of mass destruction, in doing harm to americans without a license or any legal bases for doing so. all we want is rational gun safety and gun violence prevention. i look forward to continuing to work with you in that regard. it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from illinois (ms. kelly), one of my classmates. she has been a tremendous and forceful advocate for gun violence prevention measures, not only as the chair of the cbc health braintrust, for which she has been tireless on so many different issues, but also in her capacity within the house democratic caucus, as well as a chair of the cbc gun violence prevention task force, someone who stood up countless times for the children in chicago and the many others who have been dealing with unacceptable levels of gun violence. ms. kelly of illinois. i thank my good friends, the gentleman from new york (mr. jeffries) and the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty) for this important special order hour tonight. congressman jeffries, you have chaired these special order hours for the congressional black caucus in my first term, so it is good to see you back in the driver's seat with our classmate, representative beatty. last year, i had the privilege of leading the special order hour with our colleague, the honorable donald payne of new jersey. in the course of that year, we came to this floor to reflect on gun violence on one too many occasions because it is an epidemic in communities across the country. in fact, we are 11 days into 2016, and there have already been 80 shootings in my hometown of chicago. four people were shot and killed in less than 24 hours. i applaud president obama's bold executive action that has been talked about tonight. i believe these policies will keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous individuals. if you listen to some, they will say they are trying to take our guns. there is nothing in the executive action that says that. the opposition is pushing fear, not fact. with over 30 americans killed by guns every single day inaction is not an option. {time} 2100 in my nearly 3 years in congress, the majority party has refused to do anything on gun violence--not one hearing, not a single vote. to right what congress has, unfortunately, made wrong, president obama did what was necessary to address the threat to our long-term national security and economic stability. while we can't stop every criminal from committing every crime, we can take actions that will save lives. while president obama's executive actions are crucial steps in reducing the senseless gun violence that is plaguing our nation, they do not absolve congress of its moral responsibility to act. there are gaps in existing gun laws that leave us all vulnerable to gun violence. these holes are ones that only congress can plug. i have two commonsense bills that will complement president obama's executive actions and that will help bring a reduction in firearm mortality. the first bill, h.r. 224, the recognizing gun violence as a public health emergency act, would require the surgeon general to submit an annual report to congress on the public health impact of gun violence. the bill currently has 135 cosponsors, and i hope that this commonsense proposal can get an up-or-down vote this year. also, i recently introduced h.r. 225, the firearm safety act, which would close the loophole which prevents the consumer product safety commission from creating rules regarding the safety of firearms. quite simply, if the consumer product safety commission can regulate teddy bears, bicycle helmets, and car seats, it should be able to regulate firearms. simply improving safety lock quality and improving storage safety will reduce accidents, misfires, and will prevent theft, saving thousands of lives. senseless gun violence has been plaguing our nation for far too long. it is simply unacceptable in the united states of america that gun violence is the leading cause of death for people under 24. it is time for us to come together to end the gun violence that is [[page h273]] taking a generation of young americans. i often ask: just how many and just who has to die before we take action? i urge my colleagues to attend a funeral to see and to feel the hurt and loss. your standing for moments of silence and then your sitting in silence does nothing to deal with this issue. let's stop the hypocrisy and take action and save lives. mr. jeffries. i thank the distinguished gentlewoman, my good friend from illinois, for the very powerful presentation and for her steadfast leadership. madam speaker, one of the reasons we believe that members of congress need to act is that state laws are so inconsistent from one jurisdiction to the other. in new york, we experience gun violence in certain communities at unprecedented levels notwithstanding the fact that we have tremendously significant and robust gun violence prevention measures in place. but the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in the brooklyn communities, represented by me and yvette clarke, actually come from the neighboring states of pennsylvania as well as up the i-95 corridor from states in the deep south. chicago, as robin kelly has indicated, has been experiencing unprecedented levels of gun violence. illinois actually has pretty robust gun safety-gun violence prevention laws on the books, but the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in chicago come from the neighboring states of indiana and wisconsin, which have lax laws. out in south central los angeles, the situation has gotten better over the last decade or so. california has pretty strong gun safety-gun violence prevention laws. the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in south central los angeles and in east la actually come from the neighboring state of arizona. that is why we need congress to act in order to deal with what is a national problem. madam speaker, it is now my great honor and privilege to yield to my good friend and colleague, my sister from the neighboring congressional district of mine and who has been such a forceful advocate on behalf of the communities that she represents in brooklyn, the distinguished gentlewoman from the ninth congressional district of new york, congresswoman yvette clarke. ms. clarke of new york. let me first start by thanking my brother from the neighboring district in brooklyn, new york (mr. jeffries), alongside my sister from ohio, mrs. joyce beatty, for their leadership in our congressional black caucus special order hour, discussing gun violence and gun safety measures. let me also commend the honorable robin kelly of illinois for her leadership in doing the work that she is doing not only with our health braintrust, but by being an outspoken and forceful advocate for the end to gun violence not only for her district in chicago, illinois, but for all communities across this nation. madam speaker, gun violence in the united states has reached epic proportions in the 21st century. the death, the trauma, the devastation that we are witnessing can no longer be tolerated. congress must act now. over the past decade in america, more than 100,000 people have been killed as a result of gun violence and millions more have been maimed by the reckless and unlawful discharging of firearms. i applaud president barack obama for taking this historic executive action to address gun violence in our nation. these actions will save lives and will make america a safer place. the president's actions will strengthen lifesaving background checks, improve mental health services, and expand smart gun technology. we have all that we need in the united states to observe the second amendment rights of americans and, at the same time, to take our nation into the 21st century with responsible gun ownership that leaves little room for the illegal gun activity that we see taking place in terms of gun trafficking, in terms of the use of deadly arms in the hands of those who are unlicensed to hold them. as it relates to background checks, the proposals focus on new background check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of the national instant criminal background check system, the nics, and the greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the state level. specifically, it directs the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to obtain a federal license to do so and to conduct background checks. it calls for the increased funding for the atf in the hiring of 200 new atf agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws, and it requires the atf to issue a rule requiring background checks for the purchasers who purchase certain dangerous firearms and other items through a trust, a corporation, or other legal entity. it encourages greater communication between federal and state authorities on criminal history information. what could be wrong with that? that is within the boundary of our laws, within our constitutional rights, and it makes our nation safer. i come to this floor today as one who considers herself to be a victim of gun violence. we need to confront this right away because, for many in our communities, it is not only those who have been physically harmed by gun violence, but those who have been traumatized by being a witness to gun violence. i had the unfortunate privilege, if you will, of being in the council chambers of the new york city's city council when my colleague, the honorable james e. davis, was gunned down before all of his colleagues--workplace domestic terrorism. that incident has been with me from that day forward. to this day, at a moment's notice, i can recall the trauma of that day, what it meant to see my colleague's life taken from him and to hear the gunplay that took place in the new york city council's chambers. i am not alone. there are millions of americans who are witnesses to gun violence or who may have been maimed by gun violence and who did not necessarily die as a result of it, but whose lives have been changed dramatically. we should not have another generation of americans who can speak to the unspeakable horror of what it is to either be impacted directly in the loss of a loved one or to be the families who have to recount the times when they have had to be at the hospital with someone who is trying to recover from being gunned down. it is our obligation, our responsibility, as lawmakers for this nation to get this right for future generations. so i applaud president obama for doing what he could do within the parameters of his authority. it is now time for the united states house to do its job. mr. jeffries. i thank my good friend and colleague for a very powerful presentation and for pointing out the sensibility of supporting all of the president's efforts, but particularly as they relate to the atf, which is the federal agency charged with enforcing our nation's gun laws. two hundred additional agents is the bare minimum that we can hire to make sure that the atf has the manpower and resources necessary to prevent the illegal trafficking of guns into places like the brownsville and east flatbush neighborhoods that congresswoman yvette clarke so passionately represents. if you block funding for the atf, what you essentially are doing is supporting the efforts of the merchants of death who rely on underenforcement by the atf, because of an absence of resources, in order to flood communities like chicago; south central los angeles; parts of brooklyn; newark, new jersey; and many other neighborhoods with illegal weapons. madam speaker, i yield to my good friend and colleague, congressman donald payne. i thank him as well as r. kelly. d. payne and r. kelly made a fantastic combination. we thank them for their distinguished service last year in leading the cbc special order hour. i yield to the gentleman from new jersey. mr. payne. let me thank the gentleman from new york, who passed the baton to r. kelly and me in 2015. we have rounded the corner and have put it back in his capable hands, along with our classmate's, the honorable [[page h274]] gentlewoman from the great state of ohio, joyce beatty, who is demonstrating day in and day out why she was such a great leader in the ohio legislature. she has brought those talents to bear on the entire nation. madam speaker, these are very serious times. i want to start out by commending the president of the united states, president obama, in the face of insurmountable odds, for not being hampered in wanting to do something with this terrible, terrible scourge that we suffer from in this nation. gun violence impacts many different communities in this nation, some more than others, but it impacts us all. i was proud to see the president step forward and not be hampered in doing something. if the obstructionists on the other side of the aisle want to continue in that manner, then let them be, but he was going to do something. i also commend my colleagues in the congressional black caucus for uniting with the president in this great effort. we understand in our communities what this means. we are trying to articulate it to the american people, but we understand it. we live it. we feel it. we see it. {time} 2115 the president's executive actions on gun control are a step in the right direction, but it is the responsibility of congress to pass gun reform that makes our communities safer. i have joined, along with robin kelly, who mentioned two pieces of her legislation in terms of gun control--after sandy hook several years ago, i proposed a piece of legislation that did not really see the light of day. since the president has not given up on this effort, i will not either. i have a piece of legislation, which is called the safer neighborhoods gun buyback act. it would keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people by creating a voluntary federal gun buyback program. under my bill, state and local governments, as well as gun dealers, would distribute smart, prepaid debit cards to gun owners in exchange for their firearms. my bill incentivizes gun owners to voluntarily get guns off the streets. this will make our communities safer for our children, family, and our businesses. commonsense proposals like my bill are critical to ending our nation's epidemic of gun violence. this epidemic impacts every community in america, including in my district. last year in the city of newark shootings increased 19 percent from 2014 and homicides rose by 8 percent. in 2015, there were at least 76 gun deaths in my district. one-third of all of the gun deaths in new jersey last year happened in my district. gun violence has had a disproportionate impact within the african american community and other urban areas. that is clear when you look at what is happening in my district and throughout other african american communities in new jersey. we need a federal approach to gun violence because it is a problem across state lines. case in point, new jersey is a net importer of crime guns. in other words, more illegal weapons confiscated by law enforcement came from out of the state than there were purchased from in the state. reducing gun violence is vital to the safety and security of american communities. my colleagues on the republican side of the aisle should drop the politics and pandering. they should instead join with democrats in supporting the president and his commonsense reforms and, like my gun buyback program, to address gun tragedies in all communities. let me just say, madam speaker, no one wants to take guns away from anyone. we understand the laws and liberties that have made this nation great. if we don't do something in reference to gun control, then it is shame on us. mr. jeffries. i yield to the gentlewoman from the virgin islands (ms. plaskett), a dynamic new member of the house. ms. plaskett. madam speaker, i rise today in support of our president's actions toward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to end up in the hands of people that shouldn't have them. i want to thank my colleagues, congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty, for bringing this hour here in congress. i am thankful for the congressional black caucus' special order hour for taking time to educate the american people of the importance of our president's action. while this congress and, in particular, our republican colleagues have hemmed and dithered and engaged in political inertia and, at the end, failed to act in this matter, suspected terrorists are free to legally purchase combat-style weapons. american cities and other areas of this country are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short. according to the american academy of pediatrics, guns cause twice as many deaths in young people as cancer, 5 times as many as heart disease, and 15 times as many as infections. yet, we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we spend hundreds of millions researching and mitigating the effects of those other maladies. every day this congress fails to act more american families mourn, more american lives are cut short, many in their prime, and more american cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics. even in america's paradise, my home district of the united states virgin islands, this is so. in 2015, there were 40 homicides in the u.s. virgin islands. on a per capita basis, that homicide rate is more than double that of the city of chicago. gun violence in cities like chicago, los angeles, and in other places, along with the united states virgin islands, sadly are a near daily occurrence. while we pause for moments of silence after mass shootings like the ones in newtown or san bernardino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like new york city and the u.s. virgin islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized. while the president's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know that communities like our own and the many other minority communities across this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence. i want to ask that this congress act on these things. this congress has in its power the ability to save thousands of lives. let us not allow the nearly daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new norm. we must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation in this congress this year. madam speaker, i rise today in support of the president's action toward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to end up in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. while this congress fails to act on this matter, suspected terrorists are free to legally purchase combat-style weapons, american cities are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short. according to the american academy of pediatrics, guns cause twice as many deaths in young people as cancer, five times as many as heart disease and 15 times as many as infections. yet we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we spend hundreds-of-millions researching and mitigating the affects of those maladies. every day this congress fails to act, more american families mourn: more american lives are cut short--many in their prime--and more american cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics. even in america's paradise: my home district of the u.s. virgin islands. in 2015, there were 40 homicides in the u.s. virgin islands. that's a per capita homicide rate more than double that of the city of chicago. gun violence in cities like chicago, los angeles and the u.s. virgin islands, sadly, are a near daily occurrence. and while we pause for moments of silence after mass shootings like the one in new town or san bernadino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like new york city and the u.s. virgin islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized. there were 353 mass shootings in this country in 2015--three of which occurred in my home district of the u.s. virgin islands. one occurred on a crowded boardwalk on a beautiful day in may. the second mass shooting took place in a housing community, where children played just after 5 p.m. one afternoon this past september. the third took place on a busy highway two days after thanksgiving. a mass shooting occurs just about everyday in this country, yet there are no moments of silence or thoughts and prayers extended to many of the victims. [[page h275]] while the president's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know that in communities like the u.s. virgin islands, and the many other minority communities across this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence. the citizens living in these communities experience inexcusable levels of poverty. in the u.s. virgin islands, more than 30 percent of children are living below the poverty level and in chicago, most of the south and west sides have 40 to 60 percent of residents living below the poverty level. if we are serious about making our communities safer and reducing gun crime, we must take comprehensive action to not only reduce the likelihood of mass shootings like san bernadino or new town, but also address the systemic divestment of resources, education, support in communities of color across this country that lead the scourge of gun violence that play out on our inner-city streets everyday. in addition to the president's action, this congress needs to make it a priority to make adequate investments in early childhood education and other programs aimed at lifting children out of poverty. additionally, making meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system and increasing resources to reduce the flow of drugs and illegal guns through our ports will help fight back the firearm black market. this is not about the second amendment: an overwhelming number of americans--most gun owners themselves--agree, that we must do something to stop guns from getting into the hands of people who shouldn't have them. this congress has in its power, the ability to save thousands of lives. let us not allow the near daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new norm. we must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation. mr. jeffries. madam chair, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. madam speaker, last week, president obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence across the united states. president obama laid out these much-needed steps in the face of congressional inaction, which will help to reduce the senseless gun violence that affects countless communities across our nation. in 2014, firearms claimed the lives of more than 33,000 americans. over 2,800 of those fatalities took place in my home state of texas. perhaps there will be a time when we no longer will have to read headlines about mass murders in our schools or movie theaters. but until then, our nation must take concerted steps to strengthen background checks, improve mental health services, and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. this is what president obama has sought to achieve and i truly believe that this can be done without infringing on law-abiding citizens' right to bear arms. there have been numerous critics of president obama's executive actions to reduce gun violence. however, we can no longer stand by as gun violence claims the lives of more innocent americans. the president is limited in what he can achieve through executive actions alone. that is why congress has the responsibility to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation now and put our nation on the path to preventing such violence from happening again. mr. speaker, gun violence affects individuals of all backgrounds in communities all across the united states. it is not a democratic issue nor is it a republican issue. it is an issue that affects every american in one form or another. successfully reducing gun violence in this country will take more than just legislative action from congress. it will take the collective effort of every american to change the course of our history and end gun violence in america once and for all. ____________________",70755

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to be recognized to address you here on the floor of the House of Representatives. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her presentation here tonight and the collection of people who came down to support her initiative and her agenda. I thank the men and women who have stepped up and put on the uniform and actually those, also, who have risked their lives who were not formally wearing the uniform to defend our country. I am one who, I think you know, Mr. Speaker, has great reverence for our constitutional values and the pillars of American exceptionalism, the underpinnings that make this a great nation. One of the things that we have been able to do as a great nation is be able to inspire others. If we look around the world, there are those who think that the only thing that could happen that is good to somebody is if we just bring them into America and give them access to our welfare benefits and maybe they will become good Americans and all will be right with the world, but I don't know if they have done the geography very well, Mr. Speaker, and recognize that we can do a lot more good by helping people where they are so that they can help themselves. One of the most important things we can do is not send the wealth of America over to give people money and food and housing. That goes on from time to time, and there is a good number of times it is very well justified. But the best thing we can do is inspire others to live and model after the freedom of the United States of America. Then they can help themselves, Mr. Speaker. I think of a time I sat down with several Ambassadors to the United States from Israel. We had a meeting over here in a room just off the House floor. [[Page H265]] They were explaining to me that they had adopted Hebrew as their official language. They did that, I believe, in 1954. They formed their country in 1948. {time} 2000 And I said: ``Why did you establish an official language and why did you resurrect essentially a dead language''--Hebrew--``that had not been used in common discourse or business or politics''--except for prayer--``for 2,000 years?'' And they said they saw the success of the United States with the common language that we have. English is our common language. They wanted a common language for Israelis. They wanted something that would be unique, something that would bond and bind them together, because they had seen the successful model here. They were inspired by the successful model of assimilation that came about because of a common language. So they adopted Hebrew as their official language in Israel. I was quite impressed, Mr. Speaker. I was quite impressed that America would inspire a country that had all the world history to draw from, yet they look at the model we have here to make such a definitive thing as to bring back a language that had not been utilized in common discussion for 2,000 years. I give you that example, Mr. Speaker, because I come here tonight and I want to talk about Egypt and how it is that the United States of America inspires people around the world in ways that we may not realize. I come to the floor tonight, Mr. Speaker, to commemorate and celebrate and give notice to and congratulate the Egyptian people. Yesterday they swore in and convened their parliament. That is Egypt's first parliament in nearly 4 years. It is a great day for Egypt, and it is a great day for liberty worldwide. It is a great day for the United States to see that there are others around the world who are inspired by our system of a representative form of government. I extend my congratulations to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and to the new speaker and drafter of Egypt's Constitution, Ali Abdel-Al, but also to Mr. Moussa, whom I met with on at least two occasions as he chaired the committee to draft the Egyptian Constitution. The citizens of Egypt have achieved an important foreign policy milestone, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday was that day. I was curious that they would convene on a Sunday. Only under extreme circumstances would we start our day here on a Sunday. However, Egypt is a Muslim country. It is about 95 percent Muslim--it has got a higher percentage of Christians than people might think--and they go to mosque on Friday. In fact, I learned that the Christians have their services on Friday as well. That way, Sunday is a workday. But, in any case, the short history and the most recent history of Egypt is really astonishing. I point out that it seems as though our administration has missed the importance of this. So, Mr. Speaker, I will just go through some of the history of Egypt as we commemorate and congratulate them for convening their Parliament now under a legitimized constitutional government of the sovereign nation-state of Egypt, a country that we need to expand and strengthen our relations with and a country that can be a central player in stabilizing the instability all throughout the Middle East. It is important that Egypt be a significant component of that effort that is going forward not just in this administration, but into the next administration and for a long time. Back in 1981, President Mubarak took power. He held power for 30 years. In that 30-year period of time, some people thought that he was a strong man and that he dealt harshly with some of his opposition that was there. It may be true. I am not here to defend President Mubarak. When President Obama took office, it was clear that he had a different view of President Mubarak than I have expressed here. He went to Cairo to give a speech in Egypt on June 4, 2009. And I remind the body, Mr. Speaker, that President Obama, then- Senator Obama and a candidate for President, in the spring of 2008 made a statement roughly similar to the fact he believed his middle name means something to the rest of the world. And when they recognize and see his middle name, they all know that he can communicate with them in a certain way that someone who doesn't have that middle name doesn't have that particular tool. And so shortly after that--being elected President and then armed with that conviction--President Obama traveled to Cairo, Egypt, and gave his speech on June 4, 2009, at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. Now, Al-Azhar University is essentially the global center for Islamic thought. They have Islamic scholars there that are respected worldwide within the world of Islam. So to send a message to the Muslim world, there wasn't a place that was more effective than going to Al-Azhar University to give his June 4, 2009, speech. It happens to be a fact, Mr. Speaker, that the seating arrangement was arranged, we have to presume, with the approval of President Obama. And who sat in the front row, Mr. Speaker? The leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood were seated in the front row when President Obama gave his speech at Al-Azhar University. That sent a powerful signal to the Egyptian people, a signal that the President of the United States supports the Muslim Brotherhood. Now, I don't bring this up as speculation, Mr. Speaker. I bring it back to the floor of the Congress because I am speaking from hands-on, eye-to-eye experience in talking with the Egyptian people and some of their leadership and some of their press. They say to us: ``Why does President Obama support the Muslim Brotherhood?'' That is a bit of a tough question and is a hard one to rebut when they are seated in the front row at Al-Azhar University. Well, this brought about a significant amount of unrest. It contributed to the unrest, is probably a more reasonable way to describe this, Mr. Speaker. As the unrest grew in Egypt, we also heard messages coming out of the State Department. For example, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a statement very similar to: Mubarak needs to be gone yesterday. And so the push from the Obama administration, the push from the State Department, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and others, began to put pressure on Mubarak. While this is going on, the Arab Spring erupted about January, February 2011. Of course, it was multiple countries throughout the Middle East that had unrest. And there was significant unrest in Egypt, as we know. Well, Mr. Speaker, the pressure built and the demonstrations that took place in Tahrir Square were intense. Some of them were violent. We saw on television the massive amounts of people that were on the square and weren't going to leave. With the trouble that was there, finally, on February 11, 2011, Mubarak stepped down. When he stepped down, that left a bit of a void that was still wrapped up in the chaos. During that chaos, there were primarily Muslim Brotherhood activities consisting of mobs that were attacking Christian churches, attacking the Evangelical churches that are there, and attacking the Coptic Christian churches that are there. In fact, the persecution went on in multiple cities around Egypt. There were multiple churches that were burned and razed to the ground. Some were just gutted by fire. Well, in June 2012, Mohamed Morsi came to power. He is the face and the voice--and may still be--of the Muslim Brotherhood. As Morsi came to power, they began to see how the Muslim Brotherhood would rule Egypt. The protests died down for a while, and then they ramped back up again, Mr. Speaker and got worse and worse and worse and more intense. And so the protests accelerated up to January 25, 2013. There were many protests. Egypt was more or less very difficult to govern and rule because of the protests against Morsi and because of the way that Morsi had mishandled government and the way that the Muslim Brotherhood, with their heavy hand, had worked against many of the Egyptian people. Morsi was the duly-elected President. And I believe the number was 4.6 million Egyptians that came to the polls [[Page H266]] out of 83 million Egyptians altogether. So it was a low percentage of turnout, but they saw him get elected. And then, as he essentially disempowered the legislature and disempowered the judicial branch of government, there was a democratic election for Morsi, an election one last time. The dictator had taken over, and the Egyptian people knew it. And they began to push back, Mr. Speaker. So the protests accelerated from January 25, 2013, on throughout that spring. And then, as we watched, there was a funeral at the main Coptic church in Cairo. The Muslim Brotherhood mobs attacked the funeral and killed people. And so that is a brutal division within the society that took place. That was April 7, 2013. Throughout that summer, the Christian groups were gathering together, Mr. Speaker, and during that period of time they would have regular prayer meetings to pray that God would bring relief to Egypt and turn the country back over to the Egyptian people and let them govern their country and have their country back, take it away from Morsi. As I sat and listened to Pastor Maurice, who leads a 4,000-member Evangelical church in Egypt, as they were gathering for prayers on the night of June 29, he said to the other pastors who had been regularly coming together to pray: I am going to lead the prayer tonight. I am going to be in charge of the prayer tonight. So they agreed. They gathered together and Pastor Maurice offered this prayer. He said: God, we have been praying daily for relief from Egypt. I am tired of waiting. I don't want to wait any longer. I want this relief tomorrow.'' It is the night of June 29, 2013. ``God, bring us this relief tomorrow.'' That was the eve of the relief that came. By June 30, the following day, the streets and every city began to fill in Egypt. Tahrir Square became full again. People poured into the streets of Egypt, and they poured into the streets on June 30, July 1, July 2, and July 3. The numbers of people in the streets in Egypt that came out to protest were estimated at 33 million people out of 83 million Egyptians. Now, think of that. If we had that same percentage come out in the streets of America, we would have 125 million people in the streets of America, Mr. Speaker. It was a massive turnout in Egypt. And something had to happen. They pleaded with General el-Sisi: Will you take over in this country? We can't take this any longer. We have got to have some leadership. We have got to have somebody in charge of our country, Egypt. General el-Sisi demurred. He said: No. I don't want to do this. I don't want to step in. Finally, by the 3rd of June, he relented and stepped in with the military to bring order in Tahrir Square. That turned out to be a move that stabilized Egypt. Shortly after that, they stabilized Egypt. They had more peace in the streets. There was still trouble. The Muslim Brotherhood was still attacking people. There were still arrests of some of those who had been violent take place in the square that had been attacking people. But they installed an interim President and put some stability into the government. This is early July of 2013. Myself and a couple of other Members went to Egypt over the Labor Day break in September 2013. We met with the interim President in one meeting, in a different meeting with the Pope of the Coptic Church, in a separate meeting then with General el-Sisi, and in a separate meeting with Mr. Moussa, who was the chairman of the committee that was writing a Constitution. I remember each of those meetings in a distinct way. The Coptic Pope said: We are praying for the people who are killing us. We are not going to be sucked into a civil war in Egypt. We are praying for them and are asking God to forgive them, which I thought was a very high level of faith that I don't know that I could reach, Mr. Speaker. I was very impressed with the Coptic Pope. We met with Mr. Moussa, who described the Constitution they were drafting, but he said it is up to the Egyptian people. They have got to ratify it. And as we met with General el-Sisi, I recall asking him a series of questions: If this Constitution is ratified and a legitimized civilian government takes charge in Egypt, will the military take orders from a civilian President or a civilian prime minister and a civilian parliament? He looked me in the eye and he said: Yes. The military will. So I didn't know at the time--and I don't think he knew at the time-- that he would eventually become a candidate for President and actually be the one issuing the orders to the military. But he has kept his word. As he promised to me and others promised to me, they would ratify a Constitution, they would elect a national leader or President, and once the Constitution was ratified and the President was elected, they would then have elections and seat a parliament or a legislative body. Within their Constitution they wrote the language that said, of the roughly 100 churches that have been destroyed--mostly by the Muslim Brotherhood--they would use Egyptian tax dollars to rebuild those churches. I am here tonight, Mr. Speaker, to say thank you to President el-Sisi of Egypt, thank you to Mr. Moussa and those others that worked on the Constitution, and to congratulate the Parliament in Egypt that is now seated as of yesterday. Their country is put in place now so that the Egyptian people are finally in charge of their country again. {time} 2015 And when I am asked why does our administration support the Muslim Brotherhood, I am going to continue to give the same answer: The American people support the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people don't support the Muslim Brotherhood. They have proven that over and over again. The leadership that the Egyptians have elected has proven that they have given their word, they have kept their word, they have performed in the fashion that they said. And as I have gone back now a couple of times since then, most recently last spring, in about March or April, at some significant expense, I might add, I remember sitting down with President el-Sisi, and he said a couple of things that I think that we should remember, and I believe he wanted me to convey them here on this floor, Mr. Speaker; and that is that, he gave a speech January 1 of last year at Al-Azhar University, in the center of Muslim thought, and here is the message that he delivered. The message was this, he is asking a rhetorical question, and it was: Is it possible to accept the idea that the whole world must die so that Muslims can live? That is verbatim, Mr. Speaker. It is a rhetorical question. It is the most powerful rhetorical question that I believe that I have heard. And, of course, he rejected that idea. He understands that Muslims and Christians and Buddhists and atheists and agnostics and all the religions need to live on this world together, and he is looking for that kind of peace and stability, so that no religion is persecuted, no religion is being murdered while they are going to someone else's funeral, or their wedding. And that happened also in Egypt, Mr. Speaker. So I want to thank President el-Sisi for his commitment. And I would add, also, that he made another statement that I think we also need to think about, Mr. Speaker, and that is, he said they, speaking of the Muslim Brotherhood, they are trying to establish and impose divine law on all the world. When he looked at me he realized it didn't quite register, and he said, sharia law. They want to impose sharia law on the entire world. And he put his head down, almost between his knees, as he sat there, and shook his head in rejection. I am convinced we can work with this man. He is a dedicated Muslim who is a peaceful leader, who understands this picture of the world the way it sets. When I look at the work that was done by Ataturk in Turkey, how he provided a bridge between the East and the West, and that has been drifting back a bit the other way under Erdogan, but I believe that President el-Sisi has the skill set, the convictions, and the foundation to, one day, with the right kind of support, the support of the United States of America and the free world and the Middle East, [[Page H267]] could become the Ataturk for the world to bring about that bridge between the Muslim world and the Christian world and the West. If we fail in that effort to do that outreach and tie these bonds together, these bonds that go back through history, a long ways back, Mr. Speaker, if we fail, then I am afraid there will be a tremendous amount of bloodshed. If we succeed, I believe we can eliminate and forestall a significant amount of bloodshed and bridge over this division that is coming at us. And he deserves and needs our help to defend himself from terrorists that are attacking from all directions, from Sinai and everywhere else. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence here tonight. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H264-H267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EGYPT TALKING POINTS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Egyptian people don't support the Muslim Brotherhood. They have proven that over and over again. The leadership that the Egyptians have elected has proven that they have given their word, they have kept their word, they have performed in the fashion that they said. And as I have gone back now a couple of times since then, most recently last spring, in about March or April, at some significant expense, I might add, I remember sitting down with President el-Sisi, and he said a couple of things that I think that we should remember, and I believe he wanted me to convey them here on this floor, Mr. Speaker; and that is that, he gave a speech January 1 of last year at Al-Azhar University, in the center of Muslim thought, and here is the message that he delivered. The message was this, he is asking a rhetorical question, and it was: Is it possible to accept the idea that the whole world must die so that Muslims can live? That is verbatim, Mr. Speaker. It is a rhetorical question. It is the most powerful rhetorical question that I believe that I have heard. And, of course, he rejected that idea. He understands that Muslims and Christians and Buddhists and atheists and agnostics and all the religions need to live on this world together, and he is looking for that kind of peace and stability, so that no religion is persecuted, no religion is being murdered while they are going to someone else's funeral, or their wedding. And that happened also in Egypt, Mr. Speaker. So I want to thank President el-Sisi for his commitment. And I would add, also, that he made another statement that I think we also need to think about, Mr. Speaker, and that is, he said they, speaking of the Muslim Brotherhood, they are trying to establish and impose divine law on all the world. When he looked at me he realized it didn't quite register, and he said, sharia law. They want to impose sharia law on the entire world. And he put his head down, almost between his knees, as he sat there, and shook his head in rejection. I am convinced we can work with this man. He is a dedicated Muslim who is a peaceful leader, who understands this picture of the world the way it sets. When I look at the work that was done by Ataturk in Turkey, how he provided a bridge between the East and the West, and that has been drifting back a bit the other way under Erdogan, but I believe that President el-Sisi has the skill set, the convictions, and the foundation to, one day, with the right kind of support, the support of the United States of America and the free world and the Middle East, [[Page H267]] could become the Ataturk for the world to bring about that bridge between the Muslim world and the Christian world and the West. If we fail in that effort to do that outreach and tie these bonds together, these bonds that go back through history, a long ways back, Mr. Speaker, if we fail, then I am afraid there will be a tremendous amount of bloodshed. If we succeed, I believe we can eliminate and forestall a significant amount of bloodshed and bridge over this division that is coming at us. And he deserves and needs our help to defend himself from terrorists that are attacking from all directions, from Sinai and everywhere else. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence here tonight. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H264-H267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EGYPT TALKING POINTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to be recognized to address you here on the floor of the House of Representatives. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her presentation here tonight and the collection of people who came down to support her initiative and her agenda. I thank the men and women who have stepped up and put on the uniform and actually those, also, who have risked their lives who were not formally wearing the uniform to defend our country. I am one who, I think you know, Mr. Speaker, has great reverence for our constitutional values and the pillars of American exceptionalism, the underpinnings that make this a great nation. One of the things that we have been able to do as a great nation is be able to inspire others. If we look around the world, there are those who think that the only thing that could happen that is good to somebody is if we just bring them into America and give them access to our welfare benefits and maybe they will become good Americans and all will be right with the world, but I don't know if they have done the geography very well, Mr. Speaker, and recognize that we can do a lot more good by helping people where they are so that they can help themselves. One of the most important things we can do is not send the wealth of America over to give people money and food and housing. That goes on from time to time, and there is a good number of times it is very well justified. But the best thing we can do is inspire others to live and model after the freedom of the United States of America. Then they can help themselves, Mr. Speaker. I think of a time I sat down with several Ambassadors to the United States from Israel. We had a meeting over here in a room just off the House floor. [[Page H265]] They were explaining to me that they had adopted Hebrew as their official language. They did that, I believe, in 1954. They formed their country in 1948. {time} 2000 And I said: ``Why did you establish an official language and why did you resurrect essentially a dead language''--Hebrew--``that had not been used in common discourse or business or politics''--except for prayer--``for 2,000 years?'' And they said they saw the success of the United States with the common language that we have. English is our common language. They wanted a common language for Israelis. They wanted something that would be unique, something that would bond and bind them together, because they had seen the successful model here. They were inspired by the successful model of assimilation that came about because of a common language. So they adopted Hebrew as their official language in Israel. I was quite impressed, Mr. Speaker. I was quite impressed that America would inspire a country that had all the world history to draw from, yet they look at the model we have here to make such a definitive thing as to bring back a language that had not been utilized in common discussion for 2,000 years. I give you that example, Mr. Speaker, because I come here tonight and I want to talk about Egypt and how it is that the United States of America inspires people around the world in ways that we may not realize. I come to the floor tonight, Mr. Speaker, to commemorate and celebrate and give notice to and congratulate the Egyptian people. Yesterday they swore in and convened their parliament. That is Egypt's first parliament in nearly 4 years. It is a great day for Egypt, and it is a great day for liberty worldwide. It is a great day for the United States to see that there are others around the world who are inspired by our system of a representative form of government. I extend my congratulations to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and to the new speaker and drafter of Egypt's Constitution, Ali Abdel-Al, but also to Mr. Moussa, whom I met with on at least two occasions as he chaired the committee to draft the Egyptian Constitution. The citizens of Egypt have achieved an important foreign policy milestone, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday was that day. I was curious that they would convene on a Sunday. Only under extreme circumstances would we start our day here on a Sunday. However, Egypt is a Muslim country. It is about 95 percent Muslim--it has got a higher percentage of Christians than people might think--and they go to mosque on Friday. In fact, I learned that the Christians have their services on Friday as well. That way, Sunday is a workday. But, in any case, the short history and the most recent history of Egypt is really astonishing. I point out that it seems as though our administration has missed the importance of this. So, Mr. Speaker, I will just go through some of the history of Egypt as we commemorate and congratulate them for convening their Parliament now under a legitimized constitutional government of the sovereign nation-state of Egypt, a country that we need to expand and strengthen our relations with and a country that can be a central player in stabilizing the instability all throughout the Middle East. It is important that Egypt be a significant component of that effort that is going forward not just in this administration, but into the next administration and for a long time. Back in 1981, President Mubarak took power. He held power for 30 years. In that 30-year period of time, some people thought that he was a strong man and that he dealt harshly with some of his opposition that was there. It may be true. I am not here to defend President Mubarak. When President Obama took office, it was clear that he had a different view of President Mubarak than I have expressed here. He went to Cairo to give a speech in Egypt on June 4, 2009. And I remind the body, Mr. Speaker, that President Obama, then- Senator Obama and a candidate for President, in the spring of 2008 made a statement roughly similar to the fact he believed his middle name means something to the rest of the world. And when they recognize and see his middle name, they all know that he can communicate with them in a certain way that someone who doesn't have that middle name doesn't have that particular tool. And so shortly after that--being elected President and then armed with that conviction--President Obama traveled to Cairo, Egypt, and gave his speech on June 4, 2009, at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. Now, Al-Azhar University is essentially the global center for Islamic thought. They have Islamic scholars there that are respected worldwide within the world of Islam. So to send a message to the Muslim world, there wasn't a place that was more effective than going to Al-Azhar University to give his June 4, 2009, speech. It happens to be a fact, Mr. Speaker, that the seating arrangement was arranged, we have to presume, with the approval of President Obama. And who sat in the front row, Mr. Speaker? The leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood were seated in the front row when President Obama gave his speech at Al-Azhar University. That sent a powerful signal to the Egyptian people, a signal that the President of the United States supports the Muslim Brotherhood. Now, I don't bring this up as speculation, Mr. Speaker. I bring it back to the floor of the Congress because I am speaking from hands-on, eye-to-eye experience in talking with the Egyptian people and some of their leadership and some of their press. They say to us: ``Why does President Obama support the Muslim Brotherhood?'' That is a bit of a tough question and is a hard one to rebut when they are seated in the front row at Al-Azhar University. Well, this brought about a significant amount of unrest. It contributed to the unrest, is probably a more reasonable way to describe this, Mr. Speaker. As the unrest grew in Egypt, we also heard messages coming out of the State Department. For example, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a statement very similar to: Mubarak needs to be gone yesterday. And so the push from the Obama administration, the push from the State Department, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and others, began to put pressure on Mubarak. While this is going on, the Arab Spring erupted about January, February 2011. Of course, it was multiple countries throughout the Middle East that had unrest. And there was significant unrest in Egypt, as we know. Well, Mr. Speaker, the pressure built and the demonstrations that took place in Tahrir Square were intense. Some of them were violent. We saw on television the massive amounts of people that were on the square and weren't going to leave. With the trouble that was there, finally, on February 11, 2011, Mubarak stepped down. When he stepped down, that left a bit of a void that was still wrapped up in the chaos. During that chaos, there were primarily Muslim Brotherhood activities consisting of mobs that were attacking Christian churches, attacking the Evangelical churches that are there, and attacking the Coptic Christian churches that are there. In fact, the persecution went on in multiple cities around Egypt. There were multiple churches that were burned and razed to the ground. Some were just gutted by fire. Well, in June 2012, Mohamed Morsi came to power. He is the face and the voice--and may still be--of the Muslim Brotherhood. As Morsi came to power, they began to see how the Muslim Brotherhood would rule Egypt. The protests died down for a while, and then they ramped back up again, Mr. Speaker and got worse and worse and worse and more intense. And so the protests accelerated up to January 25, 2013. There were many protests. Egypt was more or less very difficult to govern and rule because of the protests against Morsi and because of the way that Morsi had mishandled government and the way that the Muslim Brotherhood, with their heavy hand, had worked against many of the Egyptian people. Morsi was the duly-elected President. And I believe the number was 4.6 million Egyptians that came to the polls [[Page H266]] out of 83 million Egyptians altogether. So it was a low percentage of turnout, but they saw him get elected. And then, as he essentially disempowered the legislature and disempowered the judicial branch of government, there was a democratic election for Morsi, an election one last time. The dictator had taken over, and the Egyptian people knew it. And they began to push back, Mr. Speaker. So the protests accelerated from January 25, 2013, on throughout that spring. And then, as we watched, there was a funeral at the main Coptic church in Cairo. The Muslim Brotherhood mobs attacked the funeral and killed people. And so that is a brutal division within the society that took place. That was April 7, 2013. Throughout that summer, the Christian groups were gathering together, Mr. Speaker, and during that period of time they would have regular prayer meetings to pray that God would bring relief to Egypt and turn the country back over to the Egyptian people and let them govern their country and have their country back, take it away from Morsi. As I sat and listened to Pastor Maurice, who leads a 4,000-member Evangelical church in Egypt, as they were gathering for prayers on the night of June 29, he said to the other pastors who had been regularly coming together to pray: I am going to lead the prayer tonight. I am going to be in charge of the prayer tonight. So they agreed. They gathered together and Pastor Maurice offered this prayer. He said: God, we have been praying daily for relief from Egypt. I am tired of waiting. I don't want to wait any longer. I want this relief tomorrow.'' It is the night of June 29, 2013. ``God, bring us this relief tomorrow.'' That was the eve of the relief that came. By June 30, the following day, the streets and every city began to fill in Egypt. Tahrir Square became full again. People poured into the streets of Egypt, and they poured into the streets on June 30, July 1, July 2, and July 3. The numbers of people in the streets in Egypt that came out to protest were estimated at 33 million people out of 83 million Egyptians. Now, think of that. If we had that same percentage come out in the streets of America, we would have 125 million people in the streets of America, Mr. Speaker. It was a massive turnout in Egypt. And something had to happen. They pleaded with General el-Sisi: Will you take over in this country? We can't take this any longer. We have got to have some leadership. We have got to have somebody in charge of our country, Egypt. General el-Sisi demurred. He said: No. I don't want to do this. I don't want to step in. Finally, by the 3rd of June, he relented and stepped in with the military to bring order in Tahrir Square. That turned out to be a move that stabilized Egypt. Shortly after that, they stabilized Egypt. They had more peace in the streets. There was still trouble. The Muslim Brotherhood was still attacking people. There were still arrests of some of those who had been violent take place in the square that had been attacking people. But they installed an interim President and put some stability into the government. This is early July of 2013. Myself and a couple of other Members went to Egypt over the Labor Day break in September 2013. We met with the interim President in one meeting, in a different meeting with the Pope of the Coptic Church, in a separate meeting then with General el-Sisi, and in a separate meeting with Mr. Moussa, who was the chairman of the committee that was writing a Constitution. I remember each of those meetings in a distinct way. The Coptic Pope said: We are praying for the people who are killing us. We are not going to be sucked into a civil war in Egypt. We are praying for them and are asking God to forgive them, which I thought was a very high level of faith that I don't know that I could reach, Mr. Speaker. I was very impressed with the Coptic Pope. We met with Mr. Moussa, who described the Constitution they were drafting, but he said it is up to the Egyptian people. They have got to ratify it. And as we met with General el-Sisi, I recall asking him a series of questions: If this Constitution is ratified and a legitimized civilian government takes charge in Egypt, will the military take orders from a civilian President or a civilian prime minister and a civilian parliament? He looked me in the eye and he said: Yes. The military will. So I didn't know at the time--and I don't think he knew at the time-- that he would eventually become a candidate for President and actually be the one issuing the orders to the military. But he has kept his word. As he promised to me and others promised to me, they would ratify a Constitution, they would elect a national leader or President, and once the Constitution was ratified and the President was elected, they would then have elections and seat a parliament or a legislative body. Within their Constitution they wrote the language that said, of the roughly 100 churches that have been destroyed--mostly by the Muslim Brotherhood--they would use Egyptian tax dollars to rebuild those churches. I am here tonight, Mr. Speaker, to say thank you to President el-Sisi of Egypt, thank you to Mr. Moussa and those others that worked on the Constitution, and to congratulate the Parliament in Egypt that is now seated as of yesterday. Their country is put in place now so that the Egyptian people are finally in charge of their country again. {time} 2015 And when I am asked why does our administration support the Muslim Brotherhood, I am going to continue to give the same answer: The American people support the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people don't support the Muslim Brotherhood. They have proven that over and over again. The leadership that the Egyptians have elected has proven that they have given their word, they have kept their word, they have performed in the fashion that they said. And as I have gone back now a couple of times since then, most recently last spring, in about March or April, at some significant expense, I might add, I remember sitting down with President el-Sisi, and he said a couple of things that I think that we should remember, and I believe he wanted me to convey them here on this floor, Mr. Speaker; and that is that, he gave a speech January 1 of last year at Al-Azhar University, in the center of Muslim thought, and here is the message that he delivered.

And that happened also in Egypt, Mr. Speaker. So I want to thank President el-Sisi for his commitment. And I would add, also, that he made another statement that I think we also need to think about, Mr. Speaker, and that is, he said they, speaking of the Muslim Brotherhood, they are trying to establish and impose divine law on all the world. When he looked at me he realized it didn't quite register, and he said, sharia law. They want to impose sharia law on the entire world. And he put his head down, almost between his knees, as he sat there, and shook his head in rejection. I am convinced we can work with this man. He is a dedicated Muslim who is a peaceful leader, who understands this picture of the world the way it sets. When I look at the work that was done by Ataturk in Turkey, how he provided a bridge between the East and the West, and that has been drifting back a bit the other way under Erdogan, but I believe that President el-Sisi has the skill set, the convictions, and the foundation to, one day, with the right kind of support, the support of the United States of America and the free world and the Middle East, [[Page H267]] could become the Ataturk for the world to bring about that bridge between the Muslim world and the Christian world and the West. If we fail in that effort to do that outreach and tie these bonds together, these bonds that go back through history, a long ways back, Mr. Speaker, if we fail, then I am afraid there will be a tremendous amount of bloodshed. If we succeed, I believe we can eliminate and forestall a significant amount of bloodshed and bridge over this division that is coming at us. And he deserves and needs our help to defend himself from terrorists that are attacking from all directions, from Sinai and everywhere else. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence here tonight.

in egypt. tahrir square became full again. people poured into the streets of egypt, and they poured into the streets on june 30, july 1, july 2, and july 3. the numbers of people in the streets in egypt that came out to protest were estimated at 33 million people out of 83 million egyptians. now, think of that. if we had that same percentage come out in the streets of america, we would have 125 million people in the streets of america, mr. speaker. it was a massive turnout in egypt. and something had to happen. they pleaded with general el-sisi: will you take over in this country? we can't take this any longer. we have got to have some leadership. we have got to have somebody in charge of our country, egypt. general el-sisi demurred. he said: no. i don't want to do this. i don't want to step in. finally, by the 3rd of june, he relented and stepped in with the military to bring order in tahrir square. that turned out to be a move that stabilized egypt. shortly after that, they stabilized egypt. they had more peace in the streets. there was still trouble. the muslim brotherhood was still attacking people. there were still arrests of some of those who had been violent take place in the square that had been attacking people. but they installed an interim president and put some stability into the government. this is early july of 2013. myself and a couple of other members went to egypt over the labor day break in september 2013. we met with the interim president in one meeting, in a different meeting with the pope of the coptic church, in a separate meeting then with general el-sisi, and in a separate meeting with mr. moussa, who was the chairman of the committee that was writing a constitution. i remember each of those meetings in a distinct way. the coptic pope said: we are praying for the people who are killing us. we are not going to be sucked into a civil war in egypt. we are praying for them and are asking god to forgive them, which i thought was a very high level of faith that i don't know that i could reach, mr. speaker. i was very impressed with the coptic pope. we met with mr. moussa, who described the constitution they were drafting, but he said it is up to the egyptian people. they have got to ratify it. and as we met with general el-sisi, i recall asking him a series of questions: if this constitution is ratified and a legitimized civilian government takes charge in egypt, will the military take orders from a civilian president or a civilian prime minister and a civilian parliament? he looked me in the eye and he said: yes. the military will. so i didn't know at the time--and i don't think he knew at the time-- that he would eventually become a candidate for president and actually be the one issuing the orders to the military. but he has kept his word. as he promised to me and others promised to me, they would ratify a constitution, they would elect a national leader or president, and once the constitution was ratified and the president was elected, they would then have elections and seat a parliament or a legislative body. within their constitution they wrote the language that said, of the roughly 100 churches that have been destroyed--mostly by the muslim brotherhood--they would use egyptian tax dollars to rebuild those churches. i am here tonight, mr. speaker, to say thank you to president el-sisi of egypt, thank you to mr. moussa and those others that worked on the constitution, and to congratulate the parliament in egypt that is now seated as of yesterday. their country is put in place now so that the egyptian people are finally in charge of their country again. {time} 2015 and when i am asked why does our administration support the muslim brotherhood, i am going to continue to give the same answer: the american people support the egyptian people. the egyptian people don't support the muslim brotherhood. they have proven that over and over again. the leadership that the egyptians have elected has proven that they have given their word, they have kept their word, they have performed in the fashion that they said. and as i have gone back now a couple of times since then, most recently last spring, in about march or april, at some significant expense, i might add, i remember sitting down with president el-sisi, and he said a couple of things that i think that we should remember, and i believe he wanted me to convey them here on this floor, mr. speaker; and that is that, he gave a speech january 1 of last year at al-azhar university, in the center of muslim thought, and here is the message that he delivered. the message was this, he is asking a rhetorical question, and it was: is it possible to accept the idea that the whole world must die so that muslims can live? that is verbatim, mr. speaker. it is a rhetorical question. it is the most powerful rhetorical question that i believe that i have heard. and, of course, he rejected that idea. he understands that muslims and christians and buddhists and atheists and agnostics and all the religions need to live on this world together, and he is looking for that kind of peace and stability, so that no religion is persecuted, no religion is being murdered while they are going to someone else's funeral, or their wedding. and that happened also in egypt, mr. speaker. so i want to thank president el-sisi for his commitment. and i would add, also, that he made another statement that i think we also need to think about, mr. speaker, and that is, he said they, speaking of the muslim brotherhood, they are trying to establish and impose divine law on all the world. when he looked at me he realized it didn't quite register, and he said, sharia law. they want to impose sharia law on the entire world. and he put his head down, almost between his knees, as he sat there, and shook his head in rejection. i am convinced we can work with this man. he is a dedicated muslim who is a peaceful leader, who understands this picture of the world the way it sets. when i look at the work that was done by ataturk in turkey, how he provided a bridge between the east and the west, and that has been drifting back a bit the other way under erdogan, but i believe that president el-sisi has the skill set, the convictions, and the foundation to, one day, with the right kind of support, the support of the united states of america and the free world and the middle east, [[page h267]] could become the ataturk for the world to bring about that bridge between the muslim world and the christian world and the west. if we fail in that effort to do that outreach and tie these bonds together, these bonds that go back through history, a long ways back, mr. speaker, if we fail, then i am afraid there will be a tremendous amount of bloodshed. if we succeed, i believe we can eliminate and forestall a significant amount of bloodshed and bridge over this division that is coming at us. and he deserves and needs our help to defend himself from terrorists that are attacking from all directions, from sinai and everywhere else. mr. speaker, i appreciate your indulgence here tonight. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",19285

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgH276,CREC-2016-01-11,114,ARMED STANDOFF IN OREGON,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H276-H278] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ARMED STANDOFF IN OREGON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) until 10 p.m. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor this evening to speak about an armed standoff that is taking place in my State of Oregon. This is the ninth day of armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge where we have some lawless, reckless behavior on the part of out-of-State zealots who have taken over a Federal resource. This is really hard to comprehend for a moment. As has been mentioned by numerous commentators, imagine what would happen if armed protesters who were of a different color or of a different religion occupied a Federal facility in Chicago or Washington, D.C., or Philadelphia. We would not tolerate that behavior. We would watch people move in to remove them. And yet, here, we are talking about the ninth day with impunity these people have undertaken to exert their own vision for an amazing region, this high desert plateau in eastern Oregon, a region of vast, arid, high desert with many key lakes and wetlands, that is the location of a wildlife refuge that was created in 1908 by President Teddy Roosevelt. It was deemed important to protect this critical flyway, this wildlife habitat. We found people there slaughtering wildlife to take the feathers to decorate women's hats. Now, I understand that there are some people who are involved who have some frustrations about issues of management of Federal resources. I appreciate that. This is a large, vast country, with 323 million people. In much of the West, a significant portion of the land is owned, managed, and administered by the Federal Government on behalf of all 323 million of us. I have no doubt that occasionally there is frustration, there is a difference of philosophy. Occasionally, there are mistakes made. One of the problems we face is that my Republican friends in Congress for years have refused to adequately fund these programs, being able to take care of them appropriately, and that leads to frustrations as well. But I think it is important to note that, contrary to the actions of these armed thugs, this land doesn't belong to them. It doesn't belong to the 7,000 residents of Malheur County or even 4 million Oregonians. This land is in trust for 323 million Americans. If we overrule these interests and get the Federal Government out of this [[Page H277]] equation, it is not going to revert to a few of the people in the region. The people who have first claim on this land are the Paiute Indians, who resided on it for thousands of years before the Federal Government came in and crowded them out. This vast high desert area is worthy of protection, whether it is monument or wilderness. Many Oregonians, including people in eastern and central Oregon, agree that this is worthy of protection. I met with a number in central Oregon this year who were organized, Friends of the Owyhee, for instance, people who think that this largest area in the lower 48 States of pristine beauty, of great environmental import, is the largest unprotected area in the lower 48 States. Now, I listened to my friend from Oregon who represents the area, Congressman Walden, express his concern and frustration. He talked about his challenges with the Steens Wilderness Area and talked about his deep concern that the administration may consider a monument in the future for this area, monument status for hundreds of thousands of these acres. It is interesting to note, I was involved with that process, but not as deeply as my friend Congressman Walden, who I think can justly claim credit for having been the driving force behind protecting the Steens Wilderness Area. But it never would have achieved wilderness status without the prospect, the looming threat, of a monument status. {time} 2145 I was pleased in a small way to have helped facilitate that going forward. We are all better off as a result of the process that took place. I was rather surprised that, in the course of his extensive comments on the floor of the House a week ago, while talking about the cooperative effort and the value of the work for Steen's Wilderness, he did not reference at all the process that has been taking place in the Malheur Basin, where we have seen advocates for local ranching interests, environmentalists, and people in the refuge management itself all come together from 2010 to 2013, developing a vision to protect this area, having one of the largest water projects in the country over the next 15 years: a plan, a vision, a commitment. And it was done on a cooperative basis. You can review what is going on with the ongoing media coverage or with these armed, out-of-State thugs who have invaded the wildlife refuge with no hint of what has happened there to be able to build a consensus, a vision, to protect and enhance this area. The notion somehow that government ought to get out of the way and turn this all over to the private sector is a bit strained. First of all, it should be noted that about half the jobs in this little county of 7,000 people are themselves government jobs. Many of them in the wildlife refuge are some of the best jobs in the region. They may not make much difference in Portland, Eugene, Seattle, or Washington, D.C., but in a region like this, it is having hundreds of family-wage jobs with good benefits, pensions. It makes a huge difference to the local economy. I am concerned that we are just passing over this expectation that we have an opportunity to be able to work with the affected people, move it forward, protecting this area as opposed to having folks who are threatening public employees and who have engaged on a personal basis in threatening people. We have had to shut down a number of government operations. It is sad, it is unfortunate, and it is wrong. We don't need outsiders coming into Oregon or politicians enabling or encouraging people to behave in this reckless, lawless fashion. We should, as a matter of fact, cut them off. There should be no electricity to the compound. They shouldn't be using the computers of public employees. We shouldn't have them ordering out for pizza or delivering food. This is goofy. It wouldn't happen in any other area if armed thugs took over a Federal facility. I have great sympathy with my friend and colleague, Peter DeFazio, who felt that, by the Federal Government not acting on the Nevada lawbreakers who refused to pay the heavily discounted grazing fees--a fraction of what they would pay if it were in private hands--and allowing this to go on unabated, they are encouraging this lawless, reckless behavior. I am pleased this evening that I am joined by my friend and colleague from California, Congressman Huffman, who, prior to coming to Congress, had a long, distinguished career dealing with environmental protection and dealing with balancing these interests and solving problems while we protect public interests. I yield to the gentleman for his comments this evening. Mr. HUFFMAN. I want to thank my friend from Oregon for his leadership and advocacy and calling us together for this important discussion tonight. I want to thank him also for bringing up our great conservation hero, Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican President who I can't help but think is rolling in his grave over the fact that cornerstones of his legacy--the protection of public lands, the protection of wildlife--are under constant assault by too many of our friends across the aisle and, for the last 2 weeks, by some very wrong-headed individuals who are heavily armed at a wildlife refuge in southern Oregon. Many Americans who turned on their TVs last week I think were probably surprised to see that this heavily armed extremist group had taken over a national wildlife refuge and that they were threatening to kill anyone who stands in their way. They were led, of course, by Ammon Bundy, the son of the infamous Cliven Bundy, that great philosopher who romanticizes slavery, refuses to pay legally required grazing fees, and organized his own armed insurrection in Nevada a couple of years ago. Americans were surprised to see that this group, which was part of a larger protest against Federal authority, public land policy, and environmental land violations, was so violent and so heavily armed and so extreme in their demands. I think so many Americans are just surprised to find that people would be so violently opposed to our Federal Government's role in protecting public lands and wildlife that they would do this kind of thing. But as a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I have to tell you I am disgusted by these reckless, dangerous, and criminal actions, but I am not totally surprised. I am not totally surprised. Because on any given week in the Natural Resources Committee, you can hear the intellectual underpinnings of these dangerous, violent actions. You hear the divisive, over-the-top antigovernment rhetoric that is spewed by too many of our colleagues across the aisle, Members of Congress who may now be criticizing ever so gently the tactics of the armed criminals in southern Oregon. But out of the other side of their mouth they justify their actions by arguing that their anger and frustration with the government is somehow justified and legitimate and that we should essentially sympathize with them rather than be outraged by their seditious, violent actions. I am amazed and grateful for the fact that our Federal land management and law enforcement authorities have been so patient and so passive and so deferential because of their determination to try to bring this to a peaceful resolution. I admire and respect that. I know where they are coming from. But let's be clear about this. There has to be accountability for the occupiers. This armed group of thugs occupying a refuge in the State to my north can't be allowed to do this without consequences. Because many people--you mentioned our colleague, Peter DeFazio-- believe--correctly, in my view--that this wouldn't have happened had there been some consequences to the Bundy ranch standoff 2 years ago. Unfortunately, despite a very similar action, despite all of the same heavily armed threats and violence and the near avoidance of a tragedy that could have cost untold numbers of lives, there really were no consequences. My understanding is that Cliven Bundy still owes well over $1 million in ranching fees to the Federal Government and that he is still grazing his cattle without permission. And because there has been no consequences, his son and the current gang that is occupying the refuge obviously took the lesson that they could do it [[Page H278]] again. And they will do it again and again, as long as we continue to give them a pass. So there has to be accountability. There has to be some type of consequences for people that do this. But there also should be accountability for politicians who tacitly fuel incidents like this with their inflammatory and hyperbolic rhetoric that always casts environmental protection as an assault on individual rights and that falsely describes our national public lands as some type of a threat to State and private property owners. It is not right. The truth is, in California and across the West, our public lands are a cornerstone of lots of local and State economies, including those in my district. I have huge tracts of Federal public lands in the Second Congressional District of California, from vast national parks and recreational areas to three different national forests, to numerous national monuments and lots and lots of BLM lands. For many of my constituents, Federal lands help them put dinner on the table. It helps them pay their bills. Ninety-one percent of western voters surveyed responded that they believe public lands are an essential part of their State's economy. We need to remember this. So I want to protect public lands, and I want to work cooperatively with the Federal agencies that manage them to iron out differences. Our Federal Government isn't perfect. They make mistakes. Sometimes they are not the best neighbors. Sometimes they aren't always as responsive and respectful to the communities and individuals that live nearby. Part of our job as Members of Congress who represent those communities is to try to make sure that the government, for its part, is doing the right thing: listening, being a good neighbor. I have seen it work time and time again. And the notion that the only way to resolve differences with Federal land management agencies is to take up arms and threaten a violent insurrection is just absolutely nonsense. So those are a few of my thoughts. I certainly could go on at length about some of the success stories I have seen in my district, where communities have come together and actually collaborated with the Federal Government, not just as a neighbor, but as a partner to do things, including things that brought jobs to those communities. I have seen it in Trinity County with a process called the Trinity County Collaboration, where, believe it or not, environmentalists are working together with folks in the forest products industry and with Federal agencies and with all sorts of other interests and they have agreed to cut thousands of acres of trees as part of a comprehensive stewardship plan. It can work. It is very unique, but it can actually work. And it can work in other places. It almost worked in the Klamath, which is another part of southern Oregon where we saw this historic coming together of farmers and fishermen and tribes and government agencies. The problem is that collaboration depended on an act of Congress to actually happen. Sadly, under current management, Congress is where collaboration goes to die. And so we were unable to do the right thing there. But it can be done. I again want to thank the gentleman for his leadership in trying to interpose a little bit of sanity into this debate. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your joining me in this conversation on your past activity and what we need to do in the future. You are right. These are, if done correctly--and you have had some of these experiences in California--huge economic opportunities. There are 47 million bird watchers in this country. They spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 billion a year. In the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, almost 24,000 people made that long, long, long, long journey. And I will guarantee you they wouldn't have been sightseeing there but for the wildlife refuge. You referenced the Klamath. It is a lost opportunity if we are not on our toes. Removing those four dams that have obstructed the flow of spawning salmon, prohibiting us from meeting our obligation to Native Americans, would create hundreds and hundreds of family-wage jobs for years in northern California. It is just one more example of where Congress is missing in action and where Congress hasn't appropriately funded these agencies to be able to fully meet the opportunities. It is hard for me to express my wonderment that some people will come to the floor and somehow try and celebrate the Hammond family, people who were convicted of arson and who have a record of having broken the law before. Public records show behavior that is not that of people you want for your neighbors. These folks do not have clean hands. Yet, we have out- of-State, armed thugs taking over this facility to somehow talk about these convicted felons and undercut this process. I am hopeful that we can work together for people to focus on the opportunities and have the administration step up, act responsibly, cut these people off and remove them, and to take action against other lawbreakers like we would in other areas of the country. I appreciate you joining me today to have a little bit of conversation here to try and round out the picture that is missing from the media. It is probably not going to get us on Fox News, but these are things that the American public needs to know. Because there is a path forward. There has been a regional consensus that has developed. There is a vision to protect the wildlife refuge and its economic activities and future. It is one that we should support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H276-H278] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ARMED STANDOFF IN OREGON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock).

I want to thank him also for bringing up our great conservation hero, Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican President who I can't help but think is rolling in his grave over the fact that cornerstones of his legacy--the protection of public lands, the protection of wildlife--are under constant assault by too many of our friends across the aisle and, for the last 2 weeks, by some very wrong-headed individuals who are heavily armed at a wildlife refuge in southern Oregon. Many Americans who turned on their TVs last week I think were probably surprised to see that this heavily armed extremist group had taken over a national wildlife refuge and that they were threatening to kill anyone who stands in their way. They were led, of course, by Ammon Bundy, the son of the infamous Cliven Bundy, that great philosopher who romanticizes slavery, refuses to pay legally required grazing fees, and organized his own armed insurrection in Nevada a couple of years ago. Americans were surprised to see that this group, which was part of a larger protest against Federal authority, public land policy, and environmental land violations, was so violent and so heavily armed and so extreme in their demands. I think so many Americans are just surprised to find that people would be so violently opposed to our Federal Government's role in protecting public lands and wildlife that they would do this kind of thing. But as a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I have to tell you I am disgusted by these reckless, dangerous, and criminal actions, but I am not totally surprised. I am not totally surprised. Because on any given week in the Natural Resources Committee, you can hear the intellectual underpinnings of these dangerous, violent actions. You hear the divisive, over-the-top antigovernment rhetoric that is spewed by too many of our colleagues across the aisle, Members of Congress who may now be criticizing ever so gently the tactics of the armed criminals in southern Oregon. But out of the other side of their mouth they justify their actions by arguing that their anger and frustration with the government is somehow justified and legitimate and that we should essentially sympathize with them rather than be outraged by their seditious, violent actions. I am amazed and grateful for the fact that our Federal land management and law enforcement authorities have been so patient and so passive and so deferential because of their determination to try to bring this to a peaceful resolution. I admire and respect that. I know where they are coming from. But let's be clear about this. There has to be accountability for the occupiers. This armed group of thugs occupying a refuge in the State to my north can't be allowed to do this without consequences. Because many people--you mentioned our colleague, Peter DeFazio-- believe--correctly, in my view--that this wouldn't have happened had there been some consequences to the Bundy ranch standoff 2 years ago. Unfortunately, despite a very similar action, despite all of the same heavily armed threats and violence and the near avoidance of a tragedy that could have cost untold numbers of lives, there really were no consequences. My understanding is that Cliven Bundy still owes well over $1 million in ranching fees to the Federal Government and that he is still grazing his cattle without permission. And because there has been no consequences, his son and the current gang that is occupying the refuge obviously took the lesson that they could do it [[Page H278]] again. And they will do it again and again, as long as we continue to give them a pass. So there has to be accountability. There has to be some type of consequences for people that do this. But there also should be accountability for politicians who tacitly fuel incidents like this with their inflammatory and hyperbolic rhetoric that always casts environmental protection as an assault on individual rights and that falsely describes our national public lands as some type of a threat to State and private property owners. It is not right. The truth is, in California and across the West, our public lands are a cornerstone of lots of local and State economies, including those in my district. I have huge tracts of Federal public lands in the Second Congressional District of California, from vast national parks and recreational areas to three different national forests, to numerous national monuments and lots and lots of BLM lands. For many of my constituents, Federal lands help them put dinner on the table. It helps them pay their bills. Ninety-one percent of western voters surveyed responded that they believe public lands are an essential part of their State's economy. We need to remember this. So I want to protect public lands, and I want to work cooperatively with the Federal agencies that manage them to iron out differences. Our Federal Government isn't perfect. They make mistakes. Sometimes they are not the best neighbors. Sometimes they aren't always as responsive and respectful to the communities and individuals that live nearby. Part of our job as Members of Congress who represent those communities is to try to make sure that the government, for its part, is doing the right thing: listening, being a good neighbor. I have seen it work time and time again. And the notion that the only way to resolve differences with Federal land management agencies is to take up arms and threaten a violent insurrection is just absolutely nonsense. So those are a few of my thoughts. I certainly could go on at length about some of the success stories I have seen in my district, where communities have come together and actually collaborated with the Federal Government, not just as a neighbor, but as a partner to do things, including things that brought jobs to those communities. I have seen it in Trinity County with a process called the Trinity County Collaboration, where, believe it or not, environmentalists are working together with folks in the forest products industry and with Federal agencies and with all sorts of other interests and they have agreed to cut thousands of acres of trees as part of a comprehensive stewardship plan. It can work. It is very unique, but it can actually work. And it can work in other places. It almost worked in the Klamath, which is another part of southern Oregon where we saw this historic coming together of farmers and fishermen and tribes and government agencies. The problem is that collaboration depended on an act of Congress to actually happen. Sadly, under current management, Congress is where collaboration goes to die. And so we were unable to do the right thing there. But it can be done. I again want to thank the gentleman for his leadership in trying to interpose a little bit of sanity into this debate. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your joining me in this conversation on your past activity and what we need to do in the future. You are right. These are, if done correctly--and you have had some of these experiences in California--huge economic opportunities. There are 47 million bird watchers in this country. They spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 billion a year. In the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, almost 24,000 people made that long, long, long, long journey. And I will guarantee you they wouldn't have been sightseeing there but for the wildlife refuge. You referenced the Klamath. It is a lost opportunity if we are not on our toes. Removing those four dams that have obstructed the flow of spawning salmon, prohibiting us from meeting our obligation to Native Americans, would create hundreds and hundreds of family-wage jobs for years in northern California. It is just one more example of where Congress is missing in action and where Congress hasn't appropriately funded these agencies to be able to fully meet the opportunities. It is hard for me to express my wonderment that some people will come to the floor and somehow try and celebrate the Hammond family, people who were convicted of arson and who have a record of having broken the law before. Public records show behavior that is not that of people you want for your neighbors. These folks do not have clean hands. Yet, we have out- of-State, armed thugs taking over this facility to somehow talk about these convicted felons and undercut this process. I am hopeful that we can work together for people to focus on the opportunities and have the administration step up, act responsibly, cut these people off and remove them, and to take action against other lawbreakers like we would in other areas of the country. I appreciate you joining me today to have a little bit of conversation here to try and round out the picture that is missing from the media. It is probably not going to get us on Fox News, but these are things that the American public needs to know. Because there is a path forward. There has been a regional consensus that has developed. There is a vision to protect the wildlife refuge and its economic activities and future. It is one that we should support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [House] [Pages H276-H278] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ARMED STANDOFF IN OREGON The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) until 10 p.m. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor this evening to speak about an armed standoff that is taking place in my State of Oregon. This is the ninth day of armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge where we have some lawless, reckless behavior on the part of out-of-State zealots who have taken over a Federal resource. This is really hard to comprehend for a moment. As has been mentioned by numerous commentators, imagine what would happen if armed protesters who were of a different color or of a different religion occupied a Federal facility in Chicago or Washington, D.C., or Philadelphia. We would not tolerate that behavior. We would watch people move in to remove them. And yet, here, we are talking about the ninth day with impunity these people have undertaken to exert their own vision for an amazing region, this high desert plateau in eastern Oregon, a region of vast, arid, high desert with many key lakes and wetlands, that is the location of a wildlife refuge that was created in 1908 by President Teddy Roosevelt. It was deemed important to protect this critical flyway, this wildlife habitat. We found people there slaughtering wildlife to take the feathers to decorate women's hats. Now, I understand that there are some people who are involved who have some frustrations about issues of management of Federal resources. I appreciate that. This is a large, vast country, with 323 million people. In much of the West, a significant portion of the land is owned, managed, and administered by the Federal Government on behalf of all 323 million of us. I have no doubt that occasionally there is frustration, there is a difference of philosophy. Occasionally, there are mistakes made. One of the problems we face is that my Republican friends in Congress for years have refused to adequately fund these programs, being able to take care of them appropriately, and that leads to frustrations as well. But I think it is important to note that, contrary to the actions of these armed thugs, this land doesn't belong to them. It doesn't belong to the 7,000 residents of Malheur County or even 4 million Oregonians. This land is in trust for 323 million Americans. If we overrule these interests and get the Federal Government out of this [[Page H277]] equation, it is not going to revert to a few of the people in the region. The people who have first claim on this land are the Paiute Indians, who resided on it for thousands of years before the Federal Government came in and crowded them out. This vast high desert area is worthy of protection, whether it is monument or wilderness. Many Oregonians, including people in eastern and central Oregon, agree that this is worthy of protection. I met with a number in central Oregon this year who were organized, Friends of the Owyhee, for instance, people who think that this largest area in the lower 48 States of pristine beauty, of great environmental import, is the largest unprotected area in the lower 48 States. Now, I listened to my friend from Oregon who represents the area, Congressman Walden, express his concern and frustration. He talked about his challenges with the Steens Wilderness Area and talked about his deep concern that the administration may consider a monument in the future for this area, monument status for hundreds of thousands of these acres. It is interesting to note, I was involved with that process, but not as deeply as my friend Congressman Walden, who I think can justly claim credit for having been the driving force behind protecting the Steens Wilderness Area. But it never would have achieved wilderness status without the prospect, the looming threat, of a monument status. {time} 2145 I was pleased in a small way to have helped facilitate that going forward. We are all better off as a result of the process that took place. I was rather surprised that, in the course of his extensive comments on the floor of the House a week ago, while talking about the cooperative effort and the value of the work for Steen's Wilderness, he did not reference at all the process that has been taking place in the Malheur Basin, where we have seen advocates for local ranching interests, environmentalists, and people in the refuge management itself all come together from 2010 to 2013, developing a vision to protect this area, having one of the largest water projects in the country over the next 15 years: a plan, a vision, a commitment. And it was done on a cooperative basis. You can review what is going on with the ongoing media coverage or with these armed, out-of-State thugs who have invaded the wildlife refuge with no hint of what has happened there to be able to build a consensus, a vision, to protect and enhance this area. The notion somehow that government ought to get out of the way and turn this all over to the private sector is a bit strained. First of all, it should be noted that about half the jobs in this little county of 7,000 people are themselves government jobs. Many of them in the wildlife refuge are some of the best jobs in the region. They may not make much difference in Portland, Eugene, Seattle, or Washington, D.C., but in a region like this, it is having hundreds of family-wage jobs with good benefits, pensions. It makes a huge difference to the local economy. I am concerned that we are just passing over this expectation that we have an opportunity to be able to work with the affected people, move it forward, protecting this area as opposed to having folks who are threatening public employees and who have engaged on a personal basis in threatening people. We have had to shut down a number of government operations. It is sad, it is unfortunate, and it is wrong. We don't need outsiders coming into Oregon or politicians enabling or encouraging people to behave in this reckless, lawless fashion. We should, as a matter of fact, cut them off. There should be no electricity to the compound. They shouldn't be using the computers of public employees. We shouldn't have them ordering out for pizza or delivering food. This is goofy. It wouldn't happen in any other area if armed thugs took over a Federal facility. I have great sympathy with my friend and colleague, Peter DeFazio, who felt that, by the Federal Government not acting on the Nevada lawbreakers who refused to pay the heavily discounted grazing fees--a fraction of what they would pay if it were in private hands--and allowing this to go on unabated, they are encouraging this lawless, reckless behavior. I am pleased this evening that I am joined by my friend and colleague from California, Congressman Huffman, who, prior to coming to Congress, had a long, distinguished career dealing with environmental protection and dealing with balancing these interests and solving problems while we protect public interests. I yield to the gentleman for his comments this evening. Mr. HUFFMAN. I want to thank my friend from Oregon for his leadership and advocacy and calling us together for this important discussion tonight. I want to thank him also for bringing up our great conservation hero, Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican President who I can't help but think is rolling in his grave over the fact that cornerstones of his legacy--the protection of public lands, the protection of wildlife--are under constant assault by too many of our friends across the aisle and, for the last 2 weeks, by some very wrong-headed individuals who are heavily armed at a wildlife refuge in southern Oregon.

remember this. so i want to protect public lands, and i want to work cooperatively with the federal agencies that manage them to iron out differences. our federal government isn't perfect. they make mistakes. sometimes they are not the best neighbors. sometimes they aren't always as responsive and respectful to the communities and individuals that live nearby. part of our job as members of congress who represent those communities is to try to make sure that the government, for its part, is doing the right thing: listening, being a good neighbor. i have seen it work time and time again. and the notion that the only way to resolve differences with federal land management agencies is to take up arms and threaten a violent insurrection is just absolutely nonsense. so those are a few of my thoughts. i certainly could go on at length about some of the success stories i have seen in my district, where communities have come together and actually collaborated with the federal government, not just as a neighbor, but as a partner to do things, including things that brought jobs to those communities. i have seen it in trinity county with a process called the trinity county collaboration, where, believe it or not, environmentalists are working together with folks in the forest products industry and with federal agencies and with all sorts of other interests and they have agreed to cut thousands of acres of trees as part of a comprehensive stewardship plan. it can work. it is very unique, but it can actually work. and it can work in other places. it almost worked in the klamath, which is another part of southern oregon where we saw this historic coming together of farmers and fishermen and tribes and government agencies. the problem is that collaboration depended on an act of congress to actually happen. sadly, under current management, congress is where collaboration goes to die. and so we were unable to do the right thing there. but it can be done. i again want to thank the gentleman for his leadership in trying to interpose a little bit of sanity into this debate. mr. blumenauer. i appreciate your joining me in this conversation on your past activity and what we need to do in the future. you are right. these are, if done correctly--and you have had some of these experiences in california--huge economic opportunities. there are 47 million bird watchers in this country. they spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 billion a year. in the malheur wildlife refuge, almost 24,000 people made that long, long, long, long journey. and i will guarantee you they wouldn't have been sightseeing there but for the wildlife refuge. you referenced the klamath. it is a lost opportunity if we are not on our toes. removing those four dams that have obstructed the flow of spawning salmon, prohibiting us from meeting our obligation to native americans, would create hundreds and hundreds of family-wage jobs for years in northern california. it is just one more example of where congress is missing in action and where congress hasn't appropriately funded these agencies to be able to fully meet the opportunities. it is hard for me to express my wonderment that some people will come to the floor and somehow try and celebrate the hammond family, people who were convicted of arson and who have a record of having broken the law before. public records show behavior that is not that of people you want for your neighbors. these folks do not have clean hands. yet, we have out- of-state, armed thugs taking over this facility to somehow talk about these convicted felons and undercut this process. i am hopeful that we can work together for people to focus on the opportunities and have the administration step up, act responsibly, cut these people off and remove them, and to take action against other lawbreakers like we would in other areas of the country. i appreciate you joining me today to have a little bit of conversation here to try and round out the picture that is missing from the media. it is probably not going to get us on fox news, but these are things that the american public needs to know. because there is a path forward. there has been a regional consensus that has developed. there is a vision to protect the wildlife refuge and its economic activities and future. it is one that we should support. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",16605

Res. 23 is a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5 of the United States Code of a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relating to ``Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units.'' This resolution would nullify EPA's carbon pollution standards for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants. Accordingly, I am withholding my approval of this resolution. (The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655 (1929)). Climate change poses a profound threat to our future and future generations. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse gas, are higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years. In 2009, EPA determined that greenhouse gas pollution endangers Americans' health and welfare by causing long-lasting changes in the climate that can have, and are already having, a range of negative effects on human health, the climate, and the environment. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, and established science confirms that we will experience stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons, and other intensified impacts as the planet warms. The Pentagon has determined that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. Power plants are the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in our country. Although we have limits on other dangerous pollutants from power plants, the carbon pollution standards and the Clean Power Plan ensure that we will finally have national standards to reduce the amount of carbon pollution that our power plants can emit. The carbon pollution standards will ensure that, when we make major investments in power generation infrastructure, we also deploy available technologies to make that infrastructure as low-emitting as possible. By blocking these standards from taking effect, S.J. Res. 23 would delay our transition to cleaner electricity generating technologies by enabling continued build-out of outdated, high- polluting infrastructure. Because it would overturn carbon pollution standards that are critical to protecting against climate change and ensuring the health and well-being of our Nation, I cannot support the resolution. To leave no doubt that the resolution is being vetoed, in addition to withholding my signature, I am returning S.J. Res. 23 to the Secretary of the Senate, along with this Memorandum of Disapproval.

Res. 24 is a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5 of the United States Code of a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relating to ``Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units.'' This resolution would nullify the Clean Power Plan, the first national standards to address climate- destabilizing greenhouse gas pollution from existing power plants. Accordingly, I am withholding my approval of this resolution. (The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655 (1929)). Climate change poses a profound threat to our future and future generations. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse gas, are higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years. In 2009, EPA determined that greenhouse gas pollution endangers Americans' health and welfare by causing long-lasting changes in the climate that can have, and are already having, a range of negative effects on human health, the climate, and the environment. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, and established science confirms that we will experience stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons, and other intensified impacts as the planet warms. The Pentagon has determined that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. The Clean Power Plan is a tremendously important step in the fight against global climate change. It is projected to reduce carbon pollution from power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It builds on progress States and the power sector are already making to move toward cleaner energy production, and gives States the time and flexibility they need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions. By nullifying the Clean Power Plan, S.J. Res. 24 not only threatens ongoing progress toward cleaner energy, but would also eliminate public health and other benefits of up to $54 billion per year by 2030, including thousands fewer premature deaths from air pollution and thousands fewer childhood asthma attacks each year. The Clean Power Plan is essential in addressing the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in our country. It is past time to act to mitigate climate impacts on American communities. Because the resolution would overturn the Clean Power Plan, which is critical to protecting against climate change and ensuring the health and well- being of our Nation, I cannot support it. To leave no doubt that the resolution is being vetoed, in addition to withholding my signature, I am returning S.J. Res. 24 to the Secretary of the Senate, along with this Memorandum of Disapproval.

Mr. President, I wish to welcome colleagues back to a new year in a new Senate that is back to work for the American people. It is clear we had a successful 2015. Committees began functioning again. Senators began having more of a say again. We got important things accomplished for the American people. We are looking to build upon this progress in 2016. There is, of course, much to be done, but I am optimistic about what can be achieved with a bipartisan dedication to moving back to regular order, not just this year but in the years to come. The scale of what any Congress will be able to accomplish in a given year often depends upon the willingness of the President to cooperate and engage in good faith. When President Obama comes to address Congress tomorrow, he will have an important opportunity to demonstrate that to the American people. The question is, Will he rise to the moment? Based on what the White House has been saying in the media, it is unlikely we will hear a unifying message for our country tomorrow. That is unfortunate. I think the American people can expect to hear a positive message from Governor Haley. Many are looking forward to hearing what she has to say.

BLACK Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Chaplain is in the building, I wish to say a brief word. I have the good fortune--and have for many years--to come to the floor every day and listen to a prayer offered in sincerity by our Chaplain. The people who watch us on TV think that all he does is walk in here every day and give a little prayer. The fact is, I received information on the things he did this past year. He represented the Senate in 27 out-of-town speaking engagements. Those speaking engagements are tremendous. He has been in Nevada on a number of occasions. He is a tremendous presenter of what he does and what is good for the country. He delivered the invocation and/or benediction to 17 different ceremonies. He spoke at 10 different Senate functions. He visited with 20 different school groups who came to visit the Capitol. He delivered the invocation at 12 local events. He spoke at 26 local events. He hosted 11 guest Chaplains. He hosted three Jewish programs. He administered premarital and marriage-enrichment counseling. He mentored 20 Senate staffers in a recurring, 10-week spiritual mentoring program. He facilitated the Wednesday morning weekly Prayer Breakfast. He hosted two men's Prayer Breakfasts for Senate staff featuring Os Guinness and Michael Franzese as guest speakers. He hosted a special program at Easter, our 20th [[Page S5]] annual Thanksgiving service, and a holiday open house for the Senate community. He prayed on the Senate floor for the convening of most Senate sessions. He taught 44 Bible studies for approximately 150 Senate staff. He taught 44 Bible studies for approximately 15 staff in the Postal Square Building. He taught 40 Bible studies for the Senators in Senator Inhofe's Capitol office. He taught 44 Bible studies for 15 chiefs of staff. He engaged in hospital visitations on frequent occasions and gave weekly updates about the sick and injured at the Senate Prayer Breakfast. He delivered the eulogy for former Senator Edward Brook at the National Cathedral. He spoke at memorial services and funerals for various Senate staff members. He ministered to Senate office staff members during times of grief. He spoke to Senate staff during staff meetings. That is not all. In relation to his activities and duties, he hosted a ladies' small group Bible study every Monday, consisting of Senate staff. He had a small group of men consisting of Capitol police officers and other Senate staff for Bible study every Wednesday. Mr. President, everyone should know that he does more than give this prayer opening the Senate every day. In fact, if that was all he did, it would be well worth the functions of the Senate Chaplain, but he does much more.

BLACK Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Chaplain is in the building, I wish to say a brief word. I have the good fortune--and have for many years--to come to the floor every day and listen to a prayer offered in sincerity by our Chaplain. The people who watch us on TV think that all he does is walk in here every day and give a little prayer. The fact is, I received information on the things he did this past year. He represented the Senate in 27 out-of-town speaking engagements. Those speaking engagements are tremendous. He has been in Nevada on a number of occasions. He is a tremendous presenter of what he does and what is good for the country. He delivered the invocation and/or benediction to 17 different ceremonies. He spoke at 10 different Senate functions. He visited with 20 different school groups who came to visit the Capitol. He delivered the invocation at 12 local events. He spoke at 26 local events. He hosted 11 guest Chaplains. He hosted three Jewish programs. He administered premarital and marriage-enrichment counseling. He mentored 20 Senate staffers in a recurring, 10-week spiritual mentoring program. He facilitated the Wednesday morning weekly Prayer Breakfast. He hosted two men's Prayer Breakfasts for Senate staff featuring Os Guinness and Michael Franzese as guest speakers. He hosted a special program at Easter, our 20th [[Page S5]] annual Thanksgiving service, and a holiday open house for the Senate community. He prayed on the Senate floor for the convening of most Senate sessions. He taught 44 Bible studies for approximately 150 Senate staff. He taught 44 Bible studies for approximately 15 staff in the Postal Square Building. He taught 40 Bible studies for the Senators in Senator Inhofe's Capitol office. He taught 44 Bible studies for 15 chiefs of staff. He engaged in hospital visitations on frequent occasions and gave weekly updates about the sick and injured at the Senate Prayer Breakfast. He delivered the eulogy for former Senator Edward Brook at the National Cathedral. He spoke at memorial services and funerals for various Senate staff members. He ministered to Senate office staff members during times of grief. He spoke to Senate staff during staff meetings. That is not all. In relation to his activities and duties, he hosted a ladies' small group Bible study every Monday, consisting of Senate staff. He had a small group of men consisting of Capitol police officers and other Senate staff for Bible study every Wednesday. Mr. President, everyone should know that he does more than give this prayer opening the Senate every day.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS6,CREC-2016-01-11,114,FEDERAL RESERVE TRANSPARENCY BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6-S7] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEDERAL RESERVE TRANSPARENCY BILL Mr. REID. Mr. President, for years I have supported a responsible audit of the Federal Reserve System. The American people deserve an audit of one of the most vital parts of our government. In the wake of the financial crisis that crippled our Nation's economy, I came to more fully understand how important it is that any audit respects the independence of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is crucial to our economy recovering after the disastrous debacle on Wall Street. [[Page S7]] There were emergency provisions to address the catastrophes that only the Federal Reserve could respond to. They did it faster than the Congress could do it. Had the Federal Reserve not stepped in, the consequences of the great recession would have been tremendously worse. It would have been worse than the Great Depression. This Federal Reserve could act quickly to safeguard the national economy because of its independence, and it did just that. One of the lessons we learned from the great recession is that the Federal Reserve should not be hamstrung. It is a cornerstone of our global economy. We must maintain a Federal Reserve that is transparent, but we must also respect the independence of the Federal Reserve in order to maintain the well-being of the global economy, and that is why we included an amendment to responsibly audit the Federal Reserve while respecting its independence. The amendment passed unanimously. The bill which the Senate will vote on tomorrow, sponsored by the junior Senator from Kentucky, will critically undermine this delicate balance. Wall Street reform ensured that the Government Accountability Office could audit the Federal Reserve, and in accordance with the law, the Government Accountability Office has carried out those audits. In the year after the passage of Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve was audited 29 times. Since that time, the Federal Reserve has been audited 102 times. My colleagues don't have to take my word for it. The 102 audits of the Federal Reserve are available to everyone. All they have to do is look at the Federal Reserve Website. Proponents of this bill know that. Their calls for audits have been answered. So let's be clear. This bill is not about auditing the Federal Reserve. It is not about transparency or keeping the books for the Fed. The oversight already exists. This bill is about giving tea party Republicans and their billionaire donors the ability to control the economy of the United States. It is an attack on policies that are designed to stabilize the U.S. economy and help the middle class bounce back. Political parties should not and cannot run monetary policy at the Federal Reserve. That would be disastrous. I am disappointed the Senate will waste its time on another misguided partisan attack such as this one. The bill is an attack on the Federal Reserve mandate to create full employment. These attacks are partisan in nature, and it is unconscionable to think that the Republican leader will begin this year attacking policies that benefit the middle class. Some Republicans agree. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, said this of the audit the Fed bill: It's obvious to me that the Audit the Fed effort is to not address auditing the Fed because the Fed is audited. . . . to me it's an attempt to allow Congress to be able to put pressure on Fed members relative to monetary policy. And I would just advocate that that would not be a particularly good idea and it would cause us to put off tough decisions for the future, like we currently are doing with budgetary matters. I agree with Senator Corker. Injecting politics into the Federal Reserve is a bad idea. This bill is a sham. We should dispense with it quickly, and we should do it--if there is any word quicker than quick, let's do it that way. I will vote against the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. Will the Chair announce the business of the day? ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S6-S7] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEDERAL RESERVE TRANSPARENCY BILL Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on another subject, I had the good fortune yesterday to attend the funeral of Dale Bumpers in Little Rock, AR. The ceremony lasted almost 2 hours. It was a stunningly spiritual, humorous, and historical occasion. Dale Bumpers performed at that desk back there by the exit of this door. He had an extra long extension cord, and he traipsed around back there, walking back and forth, speaking only as he could do. It is what we do here in the Senate. Based on seniority, everyone moves forward. He served here for a quarter of a century, but he never wanted to leave that space back there because that was his place to inform the public about how he felt about different issues. Coming from the Presiding Officer's State, he was a man who didn't fit the mold necessarily of what a lot of people expected of a Senator, but he was a giant killer politically. He defeated Orval Faubus after he had been in a governorship in the State of Arkansas for many years-- a famous man; he beat him. Four years later, he beat William Fulbright, a longtime Member of the U.S. Senate and one of the most prominent, famous Senators in the history of the country. Then he started 24 years of service here in the Senate. I have great admiration for Dale Bumpers. The speeches and eulogies given yesterday were remarkable. His son Brent spoke for a short period of time. Former Senator David Pryor spoke for quite a while and talked about things they did together, the work they did on behalf of Arkansas. At the Pryor Center, they are doing a recorded history of how people feel about Senator Bumpers. I had the ability to give my view. I said that I did not know of a Senate delegation with more power than Bumpers and Pryor had for the State of Arkansas during my more than three decades of service here in the Capitol. I have never seen two people who had as much power and prestige for a State as Bumpers and Pryor had. I am very fortunate that Landra and I were able to attend that funeral and listen to the eulogies given by Pryor and then, of course, by President Bill Clinton. It is too bad that the entire service couldn't have been recorded because it was hilarious. He was an extremely funny man and a man who taught me a lot about the Senate. I have missed him for a long time, and I will always remember him for a number of reasons, not the least of which was his ability to speak. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S5] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING DALE BUMPERS Mr. REID.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS5-2,CREC-2016-01-11,114,THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S5-S6] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP Mr. REID. Mr. President, in less than 300 days, the American people will head to the polls to elect the President of the United States. An election year places the state of our Union under intense scrutiny. At this time it is important to remember just how far we have come through the leadership of President Barack Obama. I can remember the first time I heard Barack Obama's name. I was in the House gym, where I worked out for many years. Former Members have a little room in the back. Abner Mikva--long-time Congressman from Illinois, top lawyer for President Clinton, appellate court judge, and has had quite a remarkable career himself--was there. While we were getting dressed, he said to me: We have a Senate race in Illinois. And I asked: Well, whom are you supporting? He said: Barack Obama. I thought he was trying to be funny. Barack Obama? Come on. That is basically what I said to him, but I was wrong and he was right. This man with the unusual name was elected President of the United States. It is important to remember just how far we have come through his leadership. After 8 years of disaster under President Bush, the American people embraced President Obama's message of hope and change. On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama became the first African-American President in the history of our country. Instead of working with the President to repair our economy, strengthen the middle class, and help working families, Republicans have chosen a path, for 7 years, of relentless obstruction. In fact, during the President's first term, the Republican leader publicly said: ``The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term President.'' As we look back over 7 years of the Obama Presidency, one thing is clear: Republicans have failed in their radical crusade against him. President Obama inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression. He acted immediately to address the economic crisis and begin rebuilding our economy. Because of President Obama, our economy has fought back from the brink of destruction, which is what it really was. Last month, record car sales were announced for the year 2015. How did it come about? Because President Obama went against the Republicans every step of the way by saving Chrysler and GM and giving Ford a great boost. The most significant car and truck sales in the history of our country occurred last year. Millions of Americans now have health care. The President made sure he fulfilled his promise of getting Osama bin Laden, and he did. He was killed. The President has taken bold action to address our broken immigration system, doubled our country's production of renewable energy, and expanded access to higher education for millions of Americans. I have a lot of affection and admiration for President Obama and most everyone knows that. I have had the good fortune of working with him for the past 9 years in the Senate and as President. His rescuing the Nation from crisis, his bold legislative achievement, and his refusal to back down in the face of Republican obstruction have made him one of the best Presidents of all time. No State was hit harder by the recession and foreclosure crisis than Nevada. President Obama provided the resources necessary to stabilize the shattered housing markets, keep responsible borrowers in their homes, and reduce foreclosures. Through the efforts he made, the President and his administration were able to provide about $200 million to Nevada's hardest hit homes, and there were lots of them. It didn't take care of all the problems, but it certainly helped a great deal. These were programs that provided unemployed and underemployed homeowners financial assistance. Nevada's unemployment rate reached almost 14 percent. Across the country, the rate of unemployment was about 10 percent. Today we have seen over 70 consecutive months of job growth, and our economy has added more than 14 million private sector jobs during the Obama years. Keep in mind what was happening during the last months of the Bush administration. During the first 2 months after the President was elected but not sworn into office, 800,000 jobs were lost 2 months in a row. It is hard to comprehend that, but that is what happened. [[Page S6]] Now we have seen the evidence of our Nation's job market continuing to bounce back. Last week alone almost 300,000 jobs were announced in the preceding month of December. A recent report shows that businesses have added 5.6 million jobs in the last 2 years alone, the most since the end of the Clinton administration. This certainly wouldn't have been possible without President Obama's leadership. Nevada's unemployment rate, which I have already mentioned, was the worst in the Nation. We had an ongoing struggle with the State of Rhode Island for years as to which had the worst unemployment--Rhode Island or Nevada. Neither State wanted to win, but we both won on many occasions as to which had the highest unemployment rate. Thanks to President Obama's leadership, we are finally coming back in a very strong way. In December, the President signed a tax bill that includes one of the biggest anti-poverty tools in a generation. It will help lift 16 million modest- and low-income working families out of poverty, including 8 million children. Renewable energy is taking off like never before as a result of that legislation. President Obama and Senate Democrats have brought our economy back from the brink of destruction. I have already talked about the auto industry. We took on Wall Street to ensure that the greed and corruption which produced the great recession would never happen again. Republicans said no at every turn, but we succeeded in spite of their obstruction. Health care. Before President Obama took office, tens of millions of Americans were denied health insurance. Thanks to the hard work of President Obama and the Democrats in Congress, the Affordable Care Act has banned insurance company discrimination, requiring coverage without regard to preexisting conditions or health status. That is just a little bit of what has been done. Since the law took effect, 17 million uninsured Americans have now gained insurance coverage. The success of ObamaCare is undeniable and made health care available to millions, slowed the rate of health care cost growth, and it did not cause any of the horrible problems that were talked about, prophesied, and that were suggested would happen by Republicans. In effect, what they said was all wrong. Immigration. Immigration was a problem before President Obama took office, but he tried to do something about it, and of course Republicans blocked that also. At the State of the Union Address 2 years ago, he said: I worked with you. I have tried, I have pleaded, and I am tired of doing this. I will have to do things on my own now because you will not do it legislatively. And he has done that. We failed to pass the DREAM Act in 2010. President Obama acted to protect DREAMers, by announcing DACA, deferred action for childhood arrivals. To date, almost 700,000 young individuals have been protected from deportation. Since then, Democrats led the charge for comprehensive immigration reform to fix our Nation's broken immigration system. The Senate passed bipartisan immigration reform in 2013, which was important, but we now have people, such as the junior Senator from Florida, for example, who helped pass that legislation, but once he started running for national office decided that everything he did in bringing that bill to the Senate floor was wrong, and he has taken a 360-degree turn and said: I did all of that, but I guess I was wrong. We haven't been able to get it out of the House, and now we have people such as the junior Senator from Florida who is denigrating his own bill. President Obama acted within his legal Executive authority to unite American families and strengthen our immigration system, including protecting some adults with children in the United States from deportation. It is a longer story than that, but that is the short story. Energy and the environment. Climate change is one of the greatest, if not the greatest threat, the world has ever known. Because of President Obama's leadership, the world is on track to keep temperatures from rising and avoid the most catastrophic impact of climate change. By negotiating the historic Paris climate agreement, the President has crafted a version of clean energy and climate change for our country by establishing carbon emission standards on vehicles that help consumers save money on fuel for the first time by limiting carbon pollution from powerplants. He established or expanded 19 national monuments. Why? Because Republicans--bills we passed matter-of-factually here--always refused to allow us to have votes on them. So he moved forward, as he said he would do, with an Executive action for 19 national monuments. In Nevada, it includes the 750,000 acres of the Basin and Range National Monument, which is something that is great and all Americans can share. The President believes these lands belong to all Americans and that our children and grandchildren should be able to enjoy the beauty and bounty of our country. Education. When President Obama took office, our Nation's education system was in desperate need of reform. No Child Left Behind crippled schools around the country and graduation rates were at historic lows. One of the most important actions President Obama took through the recovery act was nearly $100 billion in aid for K-12 and higher education. Today students across the country have made tremendous progress. More students have graduated than ever before, particularly low-income and minority students. President Obama also took historic steps to address extreme levels of student debt in this country. By working with Democrats, President Obama created new programs to help college graduates manage their student debt by capping their loan payments by 10 percent of their income. We wanted to do more, but obstruction raised its ugly head and Republicans refused to allow us to do even more. Guns. Mass murders have taken place all over, and Nevada is no exception. It has happened there also. From the time he was elected President, Republicans have tried every means possible by working arm in arm and hand in hand with the NRA to stop everything the President has tried to accomplish. Even though more than 80 percent of the American people said there should be background checks for people who are crazy and criminals, it is not good enough for Republicans. They have still stopped us. The President tried to work with Republicans and they have refused. This has brought about his new efforts to use Executive action. Last week he did just that. He addressed the epidemic of gun violence in this country through legal Executive action. Republicans have blocked this action, even in the wake of cold-blooded mass murders in schools, houses of worship, movie theaters, and many other places. Tomorrow the President will deliver his final State of the Union Address to the American people. I look forward to hearing ways in which he plans to continue and push our Nation forward during his last year in office. We will do everything in our power, as Democrats, to build on the strong legacy President Obama has established. We will continue to fight to strengthen the middle class and working families by addressing the mountain of student debt that saddles Americans' higher education. We will continue fighting to increase the minimum wage. We will not rest until wages of women match the wages of their male counterparts, and we will continue to keep Wall Street accountable by prioritizing Main Street and protecting the good work the Dodd-Frank legislation did. As we begin this legislative session, I hope we will find in our Republicans a willing partner to protect and strengthen our Nation. I hope it is not wishful thinking, but it probably is. We stand ready to work with our Republican colleagues to do what is right for the American people. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S5-S6] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP Mr. REID.

When President Obama took office, our Nation's education system was in desperate need of reform. No Child Left Behind crippled schools around the country and graduation rates were at historic lows. One of the most important actions President Obama took through the recovery act was nearly $100 billion in aid for K-12 and higher education. Today students across the country have made tremendous progress. More students have graduated than ever before, particularly low-income and minority students. President Obama also took historic steps to address extreme levels of student debt in this country. By working with Democrats, President Obama created new programs to help college graduates manage their student debt by capping their loan payments by 10 percent of their income. We wanted to do more, but obstruction raised its ugly head and Republicans refused to allow us to do even more. Guns. Mass murders have taken place all over, and Nevada is no exception. It has happened there also. From the time he was elected President, Republicans have tried every means possible by working arm in arm and hand in hand with the NRA to stop everything the President has tried to accomplish. Even though more than 80 percent of the American people said there should be background checks for people who are crazy and criminals, it is not good enough for Republicans. They have still stopped us. The President tried to work with Republicans and they have refused. This has brought about his new efforts to use Executive action. Last week he did just that. He addressed the epidemic of gun violence in this country through legal Executive action. Republicans have blocked this action, even in the wake of cold-blooded mass murders in schools, houses of worship, movie theaters, and many other places. Tomorrow the President will deliver his final State of the Union Address to the American people. I look forward to hearing ways in which he plans to continue and push our Nation forward during his last year in office. We will do everything in our power, as Democrats, to build on the strong legacy President Obama has established. We will continue to fight to strengthen the middle class and working families by addressing the mountain of student debt that saddles Americans' higher education. We will continue fighting to increase the minimum wage. We will not rest until wages of women match the wages of their male counterparts, and we will continue to keep Wall Street accountable by prioritizing Main Street and protecting the good work the Dodd-Frank legislation did. As we begin this legislative session, I hope we will find in our Republicans a willing partner to protect and strengthen our Nation. I hope it is not wishful thinking, but it probably is. We stand ready to work with our Republican colleagues to do what is right for the American people. ____________________",package_114_238.csv,12354,12354,12422,"[congressional record volume 162, number 6 (monday, january 11, 2016)] [senate] [pages s5-s6] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] the president's leadership mr. reid. mr. president, in less than 300 days, the american people will head to the polls to elect the president of the united states. an election year places the state of our union under intense scrutiny. at this time it is important to remember just how far we have come through the leadership of president barack obama. i can remember the first time i heard barack obama's name. i was in the house gym, where i worked out for many years. former members have a little room in the back. abner mikva--long-time congressman from illinois, top lawyer for president clinton, appellate court judge, and has had quite a remarkable career himself--was there. while we were getting dressed, he said to me: we have a senate race in illinois. and i asked: well, whom are you supporting? he said: barack obama. i thought he was trying to be funny. barack obama? come on. that is basically what i said to him, but i was wrong and he was right. this man with the unusual name was elected president of the united states. it is important to remember just how far we have come through his leadership. after 8 years of disaster under president bush, the american people embraced president obama's message of hope and change. on january 20, 2009, barack obama became the first african-american president in the history of our country. instead of working with the president to repair our economy, strengthen the middle class, and help working families, republicans have chosen a path, for 7 years, of relentless obstruction. in fact, during the president's first term, the republican leader publicly said: ``the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president obama to be a one-term president.'' as we look back over 7 years of the obama presidency, one thing is clear: republicans have failed in their radical crusade against him. president obama inherited the worst recession since the great depression. he acted immediately to address the economic crisis and begin rebuilding our economy. because of president obama, our economy has fought back from the brink of destruction, which is what it really was. last month, record car sales were announced for the year 2015. how did it come about? because president obama went against the republicans every step of the way by saving chrysler and gm and giving ford a great boost. the most significant car and truck sales in the history of our country occurred last year. millions of americans now have health care. the president made sure he fulfilled his promise of getting osama bin laden, and he did. he was killed. the president has taken bold action to address our broken immigration system, doubled our country's production of renewable energy, and expanded access to higher education for millions of americans. i have a lot of affection and admiration for president obama and most everyone knows that. i have had the good fortune of working with him for the past 9 years in the senate and as president. his rescuing the nation from crisis, his bold legislative achievement, and his refusal to back down in the face of republican obstruction have made him one of the best presidents of all time. no state was hit harder by the recession and foreclosure crisis than nevada. president obama provided the resources necessary to stabilize the shattered housing markets, keep responsible borrowers in their homes, and reduce foreclosures. through the efforts he made, the president and his administration were able to provide about $200 million to nevada's hardest hit homes, and there were lots of them. it didn't take care of all the problems, but it certainly helped a great deal. these were programs that provided unemployed and underemployed homeowners financial assistance. nevada's unemployment rate reached almost 14 percent. across the country, the rate of unemployment was about 10 percent. today we have seen over 70 consecutive months of job growth, and our economy has added more than 14 million private sector jobs during the obama years. keep in mind what was happening during the last months of the bush administration. during the first 2 months after the president was elected but not sworn into office, 800,000 jobs were lost 2 months in a row. it is hard to comprehend that, but that is what happened. [[page s6]] now we have seen the evidence of our nation's job market continuing to bounce back. last week alone almost 300,000 jobs were announced in the preceding month of december. a recent report shows that businesses have added 5.6 million jobs in the last 2 years alone, the most since the end of the clinton administration. this certainly wouldn't have been possible without president obama's leadership. nevada's unemployment rate, which i have already mentioned, was the worst in the nation. we had an ongoing struggle with the state of rhode island for years as to which had the worst unemployment--rhode island or nevada. neither state wanted to win, but we both won on many occasions as to which had the highest unemployment rate. thanks to president obama's leadership, we are finally coming back in a very strong way. in december, the president signed a tax bill that includes one of the biggest anti-poverty tools in a generation. it will help lift 16 million modest- and low-income working families out of poverty, including 8 million children. renewable energy is taking off like never before as a result of that legislation. president obama and senate democrats have brought our economy back from the brink of destruction. i have already talked about the auto industry. we took on wall street to ensure that the greed and corruption which produced the great recession would never happen again. republicans said no at every turn, but we succeeded in spite of their obstruction. health care. before president obama took office, tens of millions of americans were denied health insurance. thanks to the hard work of president obama and the democrats in congress, the affordable care act has banned insurance company discrimination, requiring coverage without regard to preexisting conditions or health status. that is just a little bit of what has been done. since the law took effect, 17 million uninsured americans have now gained insurance coverage. the success of obamacare is undeniable and made health care available to millions, slowed the rate of health care cost growth, and it did not cause any of the horrible problems that were talked about, prophesied, and that were suggested would happen by republicans. in effect, what they said was all wrong. immigration. immigration was a problem before president obama took office, but he tried to do something about it, and of course republicans blocked that also. at the state of the union address 2 years ago, he said: i worked with you. i have tried, i have pleaded, and i am tired of doing this. i will have to do things on my own now because you will not do it legislatively. and he has done that. we failed to pass the dream act in 2010. president obama acted to protect dreamers, by announcing daca, deferred action for childhood arrivals. to date, almost 700,000 young individuals have been protected from deportation. since then, democrats led the charge for comprehensive immigration reform to fix our nation's broken immigration system. the senate passed bipartisan immigration reform in 2013, which was important, but we now have people, such as the junior senator from florida, for example, who helped pass that legislation, but once he started running for national office decided that everything he did in bringing that bill to the senate floor was wrong, and he has taken a 360-degree turn and said: i did all of that, but i guess i was wrong. we haven't been able to get it out of the house, and now we have people such as the junior senator from florida who is denigrating his own bill. president obama acted within his legal executive authority to unite american families and strengthen our immigration system, including protecting some adults with children in the united states from deportation. it is a longer story than that, but that is the short story. energy and the environment. climate change is one of the greatest, if not the greatest threat, the world has ever known. because of president obama's leadership, the world is on track to keep temperatures from rising and avoid the most catastrophic impact of climate change. by negotiating the historic paris climate agreement, the president has crafted a version of clean energy and climate change for our country by establishing carbon emission standards on vehicles that help consumers save money on fuel for the first time by limiting carbon pollution from powerplants. he established or expanded 19 national monuments. why? because republicans--bills we passed matter-of-factually here--always refused to allow us to have votes on them. so he moved forward, as he said he would do, with an executive action for 19 national monuments. in nevada, it includes the 750,000 acres of the basin and range national monument, which is something that is great and all americans can share. the president believes these lands belong to all americans and that our children and grandchildren should be able to enjoy the beauty and bounty of our country. education. when president obama took office, our nation's education system was in desperate need of reform. no child left behind crippled schools around the country and graduation rates were at historic lows. one of the most important actions president obama took through the recovery act was nearly $100 billion in aid for k-12 and higher education. today students across the country have made tremendous progress. more students have graduated than ever before, particularly low-income and minority students. president obama also took historic steps to address extreme levels of student debt in this country. by working with democrats, president obama created new programs to help college graduates manage their student debt by capping their loan payments by 10 percent of their income. we wanted to do more, but obstruction raised its ugly head and republicans refused to allow us to do even more. guns. mass murders have taken place all over, and nevada is no exception. it has happened there also. from the time he was elected president, republicans have tried every means possible by working arm in arm and hand in hand with the nra to stop everything the president has tried to accomplish. even though more than 80 percent of the american people said there should be background checks for people who are crazy and criminals, it is not good enough for republicans. they have still stopped us. the president tried to work with republicans and they have refused. this has brought about his new efforts to use executive action. last week he did just that. he addressed the epidemic of gun violence in this country through legal executive action. republicans have blocked this action, even in the wake of cold-blooded mass murders in schools, houses of worship, movie theaters, and many other places. tomorrow the president will deliver his final state of the union address to the american people. i look forward to hearing ways in which he plans to continue and push our nation forward during his last year in office. we will do everything in our power, as democrats, to build on the strong legacy president obama has established. we will continue to fight to strengthen the middle class and working families by addressing the mountain of student debt that saddles americans' higher education. we will continue fighting to increase the minimum wage. we will not rest until wages of women match the wages of their male counterparts, and we will continue to keep wall street accountable by prioritizing main street and protecting the good work the dodd-frank legislation did. as we begin this legislative session, i hope we will find in our republicans a willing partner to protect and strengthen our nation. i hope it is not wishful thinking, but it probably is. we stand ready to work with our republican colleagues to do what is right for the american people. ____________________",12354

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS8,CREC-2016-01-11,114,GUN VIOLENCE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S8-S10] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of gun violence and to commend the President for announcing last week a set of commonsense steps to make our country safer. The need for action to reduce gun violence in America is urgent. About 32,000 Americans are killed by guns each year. Every day on average 297 men, women, and children are shot, 89 of them fatally. Last year, by one count, there were at least 372 mass shooting incidents where 4 or more people were shot--more than one a day in America. In the city of Chicago [[Page S9]] alone last year, 2,939 people were injured by gunfire, and at least 88 people have been shot so far this year, 2016. The 468 homicides in Chicago last year sadly led the Nation--a number larger than the number of fatalities in the cities of New York or Los Angeles, which are much larger cities. There is an epidemic of gun violence in America. Can you imagine if 32,000 Americans were dying each year from Ebola or from tainted drugs or at the hands of terrorists? Lawmakers would pull out all the stops to bring down those deaths. Compare the death toll from gun violence to the death toll from terrorism in the United States. According to the New America Foundation, since 9/11 a total of 93 people have been killed by terrorist incidents in America--48 have been killed by rightwing extremists and 45 have been killed by Islamic terrorists. Americans are rightly concerned about the threat of ISIS terrorism, but we cannot ignore the threat posed by gun violence to the citizens of our Nation. Sadly, for years Members of Congress have just shrugged their shoulders as each day we hear another heartbreaking story of the victims of gun violence. It is baffling to me that Congress refuses to do anything about gun violence, especially since the American people overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis agree on commonsense steps that we should take. For example, about 90 percent of Americans agree that a background check should be conducted before a gun is sold. Background checks through what is known as the FBI NICS system help ensure that the buyer is not a convicted felon, a domestic abuser, or a person with a history of serious mental instability or who is otherwise prohibited from buying a gun. Background checks work. Over 2 million gun sales have been denied to prohibited purchasers over the years. You think to yourself, why would a convicted felon be so stupid as to go in and try to buy a gun when he faces a background check? He does it anyway. They do it over and over, and 2 million times we have denied them weapons because they were prohibited by law because of their records. There are still loopholes that would allow many sales to take place without this basic background check, especially at gun shows and over the Internet. Think about how people made Christmas and holiday purchases this year. Many of us went to the Internet. That is exactly where people are going to buy firearms without background checks. When you have loopholes like these, it is easy to understand how dangerous people can get their hands on guns. Look at the way these loopholes have affected the city of Chicago. There is a flood of illegal guns coming into Chicago from Indiana, especially from Lake County, IN, which is right across the border from my State. Last Friday, the Chicago Tribune newspaper quoted Sheriff John Buncich of Lake County, IN, saying: Individuals are skirting federal law, especially at these gun shows, whether they want to admit it or not. There's a lot of illegal gun sales. The Tribune article went on to say: Buncich stressed he supports Second Amendment rights and doesn't want to take guns from people. He noted, however, that hundreds of guns from Lake County show up in Chicago crimes every year. ``We need to do something to stem the violence,'' Buncich said. ``It's not going to hurt the law- abiding citizen.'' Last year I met with the head of the Chicago Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal agency charged with enforcing our gun laws. He told me that in the highest crime neighborhoods of Chicago, when they confiscated the crime guns after the act, they found that as much as 40 percent of those crime guns were coming in from Indiana. Here is an example of how it happens. In 2014 a man named David Lewisbey of South Holland, IL, was sentenced for illegally trafficking hundreds of guns from Indiana to Chicago. The U.S. attorney's office said that over a 4-year period, Lewisbey ``routinely traveled to various gun shows in Indiana and purchased duffle bags full of guns that he brought back to Chicago.'' Lewisbey used a forged signature to procure an Indiana driver's license, and that was all he needed to fill up the trunk of his car with ammunition and guns and to drive that Skyway over into the State of Illinois and to sell those guns in Chicago to kill innocent people. During just one 48-hour period in 2012, Lewisbey bought 43 guns in Indiana and delivered them to a convicted felon on Chicago's South Side. Does anyone believe he had a Second Amendment right to buy 43 guns with an illegal ID and sell them to a convicted felon in Chicago? I hope not. If everyone who sells guns for profit at Indiana gun shows had conducted background checks, it is highly unlikely that a trafficker like this would be able to get away with this for years. The system would have caught him. But because of the loopholes in the system, the weaknesses in the law, this individual was able to avoid detection and literally supply hundreds of crime guns in Chicago. Of course we know what happened to those guns--they turned into tragedy and havoc in the neighborhoods around that great city. I listened so many times when critics said: Well, look at Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the Nation, and look at all that gun violence. Here it is: in some parts of Chicago up to 40 percent of those crime guns are coming across the border with no background checks and sold in alleyways and dark corridors of our city. That isn't because of weak or ineffective Illinois and Chicago laws; it is because of our inability to make the Federal law stronger. Let's be clear. Background checks are not a heavy burden for law- abiding gun owners. At most, they would cause a short delay in buying a gun. But when we have gaping holes in the background check system, we are basically handing guns to criminals on a silver platter. Sadly, this Congress has so far failed to even address this problem. We weren't able to overcome a Republican filibuster of the Manchin- Toomey legislation in 2013. We tried again last month and fell short again. The President decided to do what he can within his lawful authority to close gaps in the system. Last week the President put forth guidance that makes clear that you can be engaged in the business of selling firearms even if you aren't a storefront operation. For too long people who sell guns for profit at gun shows or online have been able to avoid the requirement to conduct background checks. They were claiming they were just selling guns as a hobby. This man bought 43 guns at a gun show as a hobby and sold them to convicted felons in Chicago. The President's guidance makes clear that if you are repetitively buying or selling guns for profit, you need to get a gun dealer license and do background checks or you are breaking the law. Of course, the President's actions won't close the gun show and Internet loopholes altogether. That would take an act of Congress. But the President has made a move in the right direction, and it will help. The President took other important steps last week--clearly within his constitutional authority--that will help save lives. He is working to make the background check system faster by adding more FBI examiners and improving the system's technology. A faster system could have stopped the Charleston church shooter who killed nine worshippers last year in a horrific terrorist attack. This person was able to buy a gun under another loophole in the law because the background check hadn't been finished in 3 days. The default position, if you haven't cleared a background check, is that the gun is sold to you. That meant that this man picked up the gun when the background check wasn't completed and went out and caused this mayhem and took so many innocent lives. The President is also strengthening the reporting requirements so law enforcement will know when guns are lost or stolen during shipment. The administration is redoubling its efforts to improve mental health services and to make sure the background check system has complete records on those found to be mentally unstable. Finally, the President has sponsored research on gun safety technology. This is critical. Right now we have security features on our phones, computers, and cars to prevent thieves and unauthorized people from using them. Similar technology is available today so that an unauthorized user will not [[Page S10]] be able to fire a gun. That means a person can't steal a gun and resell it and a kid can't play with a gun and hurt himself or someone else. For reasons that cannot be explained, the gun lobby opposes gun safety technology, even calling for a boycott of any company that uses it. Now this administration is going to use its research dollars and purchasing power to promote safer gun technology. This could be a game changer when it comes to preventing gun accidents and deterring illegal trafficking. I commend the President for the reasonable, commonsense steps he has taken to combat the epidemic of gun violence. The steps he announced will not prevent all gun deaths--no single measure can--but they will help. I hope my colleagues in Congress will not take a step backward and try to undermine these basic, commonsense reforms with riders or appropriations restrictions. I am going to fight hard against the gun lobby if they try. I hope Congress will instead move forward, finish the job on background checks, and do all we can to reduce the high toll of gun violence in our communities. Over the weekend, I was visiting with friends and former colleague Mark Pryor of Arkansas. I went down to Stuttgart, AR. Anyone who is a duck hunter in the Midwest or in America knows the name of that town. Stuttgart, AR, is probably the capital of duck hunting in the Midwest or in the United States. The local radio station there is KWAK, giving an idea of their commitment to duck season 60 days of the year when Stuttgart comes to life with hunters from all over the United States and all over the world. Saturday afternoon I went to the largest sporting goods store, Mac's, and watched hundreds of men and some women in camouflage clothes getting ready to go out for the duck hunt. For them, it is not only a rite of passage, it is a way of life. They love it. You see the camouflage on everything in sight. Of course, when you go into Mac's, there are plenty of firearms for sale and other equipment that is needed so that you can hunt effectively and safely. You go in the store, and if you want to be a duck hunter in Arkansas, you first have to buy a license, which I did. Then you go through the ritual of making sure you have all the right equipment and getting ready to go out to hunt for ducks. There is not a single thing proposed by President Obama that will in any way slow down or stop those men and women who want to legally use their firearms for that sport--nothing. What the President is trying to do is to stop convicted felons and people who are so mentally unstable that they shouldn't be able to buy a firearm from having that opportunity. It turns out an overwhelming majority of firearm owners agree with the President. You would never know it, would you, as you hear every single Republican Presidential candidate condemn President Obama's actions. What a chasm there is in the culture between the people who are firearm owners and who enjoy that opportunity and responsibility and those who are on the political scene and ignore the fact that to preserve that right we should pass commonsense changes in the law to make them even more effective and make certain that people who misuse firearms do not have that opportunity. I hope to work with my colleagues in the Senate and both political parties to achieve the goal of protecting the rights of those who use firearms legally, safely, and responsibly within the confines of the law and to stop the illicit trafficking of guns that are taking over 30,000 lives each and every year. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Ohio. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S8-S10] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE Mr. DURBIN.

Last year I met with the head of the Chicago Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal agency charged with enforcing our gun laws. He told me that in the highest crime neighborhoods of Chicago, when they confiscated the crime guns after the act, they found that as much as 40 percent of those crime guns were coming in from Indiana. Here is an example of how it happens. In 2014 a man named David Lewisbey of South Holland, IL, was sentenced for illegally trafficking hundreds of guns from Indiana to Chicago. The U.S. attorney's office said that over a 4-year period, Lewisbey ``routinely traveled to various gun shows in Indiana and purchased duffle bags full of guns that he brought back to Chicago.'' Lewisbey used a forged signature to procure an Indiana driver's license, and that was all he needed to fill up the trunk of his car with ammunition and guns and to drive that Skyway over into the State of Illinois and to sell those guns in Chicago to kill innocent people. During just one 48-hour period in 2012, Lewisbey bought 43 guns in Indiana and delivered them to a convicted felon on Chicago's South Side. Does anyone believe he had a Second Amendment right to buy 43 guns with an illegal ID and sell them to a convicted felon in Chicago? I hope not. If everyone who sells guns for profit at Indiana gun shows had conducted background checks, it is highly unlikely that a trafficker like this would be able to get away with this for years. The system would have caught him. But because of the loopholes in the system, the weaknesses in the law, this individual was able to avoid detection and literally supply hundreds of crime guns in Chicago. Of course we know what happened to those guns--they turned into tragedy and havoc in the neighborhoods around that great city. I listened so many times when critics said: Well, look at Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the Nation, and look at all that gun violence. Here it is: in some parts of Chicago up to 40 percent of those crime guns are coming across the border with no background checks and sold in alleyways and dark corridors of our city. That isn't because of weak or ineffective Illinois and Chicago laws; it is because of our inability to make the Federal law stronger. Let's be clear. Background checks are not a heavy burden for law- abiding gun owners. At most, they would cause a short delay in buying a gun. But when we have gaping holes in the background check system, we are basically handing guns to criminals on a silver platter. Sadly, this Congress has so far failed to even address this problem. We weren't able to overcome a Republican filibuster of the Manchin- Toomey legislation in 2013. We tried again last month and fell short again. The President decided to do what he can within his lawful authority to close gaps in the system. Last week the President put forth guidance that makes clear that you can be engaged in the business of selling firearms even if you aren't a storefront operation. For too long people who sell guns for profit at gun shows or online have been able to avoid the requirement to conduct background checks. They were claiming they were just selling guns as a hobby. This man bought 43 guns at a gun show as a hobby and sold them to convicted felons in Chicago. The President's guidance makes clear that if you are repetitively buying or selling guns for profit, you need to get a gun dealer license and do background checks or you are breaking the law. Of course, the President's actions won't close the gun show and Internet loopholes altogether. That would take an act of Congress. But the President has made a move in the right direction, and it will help. The President took other important steps last week--clearly within his constitutional authority--that will help save lives. He is working to make the background check system faster by adding more FBI examiners and improving the system's technology. A faster system could have stopped the Charleston church shooter who killed nine worshippers last year in a horrific terrorist attack. This person was able to buy a gun under another loophole in the law because the background check hadn't been finished in 3 days. The default position, if you haven't cleared a background check, is that the gun is sold to you. That meant that this man picked up the gun when the background check wasn't completed and went out and caused this mayhem and took so many innocent lives. The President is also strengthening the reporting requirements so law enforcement will know when guns are lost or stolen during shipment. The administration is redoubling its efforts to improve mental health services and to make sure the background check system has complete records on those found to be mentally unstable. Finally, the President has sponsored research on gun safety technology. This is critical. Right now we have security features on our phones, computers, and cars to prevent thieves and unauthorized people from using them. Similar technology is available today so that an unauthorized user will not [[Page S10]] be able to fire a gun. That means a person can't steal a gun and resell it and a kid can't play with a gun and hurt himself or someone else. For reasons that cannot be explained, the gun lobby opposes gun safety technology, even calling for a boycott of any company that uses it. Now this administration is going to use its research dollars and purchasing power to promote safer gun technology. This could be a game changer when it comes to preventing gun accidents and deterring illegal trafficking. I commend the President for the reasonable, commonsense steps he has taken to combat the epidemic of gun violence. The steps he announced will not prevent all gun deaths--no single measure can--but they will help. I hope my colleagues in Congress will not take a step backward and try to undermine these basic, commonsense reforms with riders or appropriations restrictions. I am going to fight hard against the gun lobby if they try. I hope Congress will instead move forward, finish the job on background checks, and do all we can to reduce the high toll of gun violence in our communities. Over the weekend, I was visiting with friends and former colleague Mark Pryor of Arkansas. I went down to Stuttgart, AR. Anyone who is a duck hunter in the Midwest or in America knows the name of that town. Stuttgart, AR, is probably the capital of duck hunting in the Midwest or in the United States. The local radio station there is KWAK, giving an idea of their commitment to duck season 60 days of the year when Stuttgart comes to life with hunters from all over the United States and all over the world. Saturday afternoon I went to the largest sporting goods store, Mac's, and watched hundreds of men and some women in camouflage clothes getting ready to go out for the duck hunt. For them, it is not only a rite of passage, it is a way of life. They love it. You see the camouflage on everything in sight. Of course, when you go into Mac's, there are plenty of firearms for sale and other equipment that is needed so that you can hunt effectively and safely. You go in the store, and if you want to be a duck hunter in Arkansas, you first have to buy a license, which I did. Then you go through the ritual of making sure you have all the right equipment and getting ready to go out to hunt for ducks. There is not a single thing proposed by President Obama that will in any way slow down or stop those men and women who want to legally use their firearms for that sport--nothing. What the President is trying to do is to stop convicted felons and people who are so mentally unstable that they shouldn't be able to buy a firearm from having that opportunity. It turns out an overwhelming majority of firearm owners agree with the President. You would never know it, would you, as you hear every single Republican Presidential candidate condemn President Obama's actions. What a chasm there is in the culture between the people who are firearm owners and who enjoy that opportunity and responsibility and those who are on the political scene and ignore the fact that to preserve that right we should pass commonsense changes in the law to make them even more effective and make certain that people who misuse firearms do not have that opportunity. I hope to work with my colleagues in the Senate and both political parties to achieve the goal of protecting the rights of those who use firearms legally, safely, and responsibly within the confines of the law and to stop the illicit trafficking of guns that are taking over 30,000 lives each and every year. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst).

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of gun violence and to commend the President for announcing last week a set of commonsense steps to make our country safer. The need for action to reduce gun violence in America is urgent. About 32,000 Americans are killed by guns each year. Every day on average 297 men, women, and children are shot, 89 of them fatally. Last year, by one count, there were at least 372 mass shooting incidents where 4 or more people were shot--more than one a day in America. In the city of Chicago [[Page S9]] alone last year, 2,939 people were injured by gunfire, and at least 88 people have been shot so far this year, 2016. The 468 homicides in Chicago last year sadly led the Nation--a number larger than the number of fatalities in the cities of New York or Los Angeles, which are much larger cities. There is an epidemic of gun violence in America. Can you imagine if 32,000 Americans were dying each year from Ebola or from tainted drugs or at the hands of terrorists? Lawmakers would pull out all the stops to bring down those deaths. Compare the death toll from gun violence to the death toll from terrorism in the United States. According to the New America Foundation, since 9/11 a total of 93 people have been killed by terrorist incidents in America--48 have been killed by rightwing extremists and 45 have been killed by Islamic terrorists. Americans are rightly concerned about the threat of ISIS terrorism, but we cannot ignore the threat posed by gun violence to the citizens of our Nation. Sadly, for years Members of Congress have just shrugged their shoulders as each day we hear another heartbreaking story of the victims of gun violence. It is baffling to me that Congress refuses to do anything about gun violence, especially since the American people overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis agree on commonsense steps that we should take. For example, about 90 percent of Americans agree that a background check should be conducted before a gun is sold. Background checks through what is known as the FBI NICS system help ensure that the buyer is not a convicted felon, a domestic abuser, or a person with a history of serious mental instability or who is otherwise prohibited from buying a gun. Background checks work. Over 2 million gun sales have been denied to prohibited purchasers over the years. You think to yourself, why would a convicted felon be so stupid as to go in and try to buy a gun when he faces a background check? He does it anyway. They do it over and over, and 2 million times we have denied them weapons because they were prohibited by law because of their records. There are still loopholes that would allow many sales to take place without this basic background check, especially at gun shows and over the Internet. Think about how people made Christmas and holiday purchases this year. Many of us went to the Internet. That is exactly where people are going to buy firearms without background checks. When you have loopholes like these, it is easy to understand how dangerous people can get their hands on guns. Look at the way these loopholes have affected the city of Chicago. There is a flood of illegal guns coming into Chicago from Indiana, especially from Lake County, IN, which is right across the border from my State. Last Friday, the Chicago Tribune newspaper quoted Sheriff John Buncich of Lake County, IN, saying: Individuals are skirting federal law, especially at these gun shows, whether they want to admit it or not. There's a lot of illegal gun sales. The Tribune article went on to say: Buncich stressed he supports Second Amendment rights and doesn't want to take guns from people. He noted, however, that hundreds of guns from Lake County show up in Chicago crimes every year. ``We need to do something to stem the violence,'' Buncich said. ``It's not going to hurt the law- abiding citizen.''

Mr. President, tomorrow evening President Obama will come before Congress to deliver his annual State of the Union Address. America has changed a great deal since President Obama delivered his first State of the Union Address 7 years ago. We remember he inherited an economy in free fall. There was a real danger that the United States would face another Great Depression. Instead, we slid into a great recession. The President--President Obama--did all he could to bring our economy back to life. Recent economic indicators show that his strategy moved us in the right direction. More Americans are working. We are seeing prosperity and opportunity return. There are still challenges ahead. We still face income inequality, and there are many things we must do to make this a fairer nation when it comes to our economy, but we avoided a Great Depression because Americans are resilient and because our government, under the leadership of President Obama, had the courage to take bold action to help put Americans back to work and to invest in America's future when the private sector would not or could not. Our Union--and our future--is undoubtedly stronger today than when the President first took office, and I look forward to tomorrow evening when we hear this President's hopes and plans for his final year in service to our Nation. This afternoon I wish to take a few minutes to talk about another President and an earlier State of the Union Address. It was 75 years ago, on January 6, 1941, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt traveled from the White House to Capitol Hill to deliver his annual message to the Nation. FDR had been reelected weeks earlier to an unprecedented third term as President. Despite historic reforms in progress, America was still battling the Great Depression he had inherited. Pearl Harbor was 11 months in the future. Understandably, many Americans wanted to believe that the war that was consuming Europe and beginning in the Pacific could remain their problem over there, but Franklin Delano Roosevelt sensed that would not be the case. He could see America would inevitably be drawn into this conflict. In addressing Congress, FDR proposed to make America the ``arsenal of democracy.'' He also urged Congress to create a new ``lend lease'' program, enabling our historic ally, Great Britain, and their allies to withstand the assault of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. He did something else. FDR knew that in order for the Nation to face World War II, America needed to know not just what they would be fighting against but what they would be fighting for. So in some of the darkest days of World War II, with Adolf Hitler vowing to impose a new order on Europe at gunpoint, Franklin Roosevelt spoke of a moral order founded on four essential human freedoms that would be the right of every person everywhere. Those four freedoms he spoke of were the freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want, and the freedom from fear. Norman Rockwell was an amazing American. He was a great illustrator. It is interesting that he did so many cover drawings for great magazines of his time, such as the Saturday Evening Post. When he heard FDR's ``Four Freedoms'' speech given to Congress, it inspired him to create images. Those images emerged after the original speech was given, and many people credit those images created by Norman Rockwell with allowing Americans to visualize what each of the four freedoms meant in very human terms. I brought copies of them to the floor because they so graphically illustrate the message which FDR delivered in his ``Four Freedoms'' speech. The freedom of speech. This Norman Rockwell illustration shows a working man standing and speaking his mind in a townhall meeting. Freedom of worship. This photo shows a group of people from different backgrounds, each praying to God--the God of his or her understanding. Freedom from want. This classic illustration shows a family gathered for a Thanksgiving feast. [[Page S8]] The last of the four freedoms is the freedom from fear. This illustration shows a mother and father looking at their sleeping children tucked safely into bed. In the coming struggle, President Roosevelt said, America would defend itself not just with arms but also with ``the stamina and courage which comes from unshakeable belief in the manner of life that we are defending.'' That is exactly what they did. During World War II, 16 million Americans--one out of every eight-- put on a uniform and fought for the promise of the four freedoms. Tens of millions more Americans back home joined the fight by planting victory gardens, recycling everything from bacon grease to tin cans, serving as ``soil soldiers'' in the Civilian Conservation Corps, and working in war munitions factories as Rosie the Riveters. After the war, the ``greatest generation,'' as Tom Brokaw characterized them, may have given up their uniforms, but they continued their fight for FDR's four freedoms. From the earliest days of the Roosevelt administration, Franklin and Eleanor had worked to rewrite the rules of America's economy to give average workers and families a fighting chance against powerful corporations and entrenched wealthy special interests. They strengthened labor unions to improve workers' pay, working conditions, safety in the workplace, health care, retirement--things we take for granted today. After the war, the same Americans who had endured the hardships of the Depression and who had saved the world from tyranny went to work and laid the foundation for the creation of the largest middle class and the strongest economy in the history of the world. They built new schools, new homes, new towns, an interstate highway system. At the same time, more Americans began to challenge longstanding injustices based on race, creed, gender, and other distinctions. As the historian and author Harvey Kaye writes, under the leadership of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, America greatly ``expanded the `we' in `we the people.' '' Under the leadership of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Americans saved our Nation's economy from ruin, saved the world from tyranny, and they did all this while making America freer, more equal, and more democratic than it had ever been. The promise of the four freedoms would inspire not only Americans, but it inspired the world. The four freedoms became part of the preamble to the United Nations ``Universal Declaration of Human Rights.'' That declaration, drafted by a committee chaired by the great stateswoman Eleanor Roosevelt, represents the first time in history that nations around the world agreed to a list of human rights to be universally protected. My wife Loretta and I are honored to include among our friends Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, FDR and Eleanor's granddaughter. She lives in Maine now, but she spent most of her life living in my home State of Illinois. Similar to her grandparents, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt is full of optimism, energy, and a fierce love for this Nation. She has done so much to advance her grandparents' efforts to make America freer and fairer. I want to say to my friend Anna, America remembers and honors your grandparents' legacy. We are a better Nation because of what their leadership and sacrifice meant to us. As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of FDR's ``Four Freedoms'' speech, it is clear that we still have a lot of work to do to make the promise of the four freedoms real. Income inequality in America is greater today than at any time since just before the Great Depression. There are many reasons for America's growing economic inequality, including globalization and technology, but the biggest reason is nearly 40 years of deliberate political decisions to undo the progress of FDR's New Deal and concentrate more and more income and wealth in the hands of the few. FDR was right when he said that ``economic laws are not made by nature [but] by human beings.'' I hope this year we can work together to pass laws that will increase economic opportunity for all Americans, rebuild America's middle class, and free more Americans from the fear of want. FDR said that we Americans believe in the four freedoms not just for ourselves but for our families, for those who vote as we do or look like we do, who live in our neighborhoods and attend our same houses of worship, but we believe in the four freedoms for everyone everywhere. An America that believes in freedom of worship doesn't allow one religious group to deny basic rights to others. Think about our Constitution, which each of us in the Senate is sworn to uphold and defend. There are only three references in that great document to the issue of religion. The first is in the Bill of Rights to guarantee to each of us the right to believe as we wish or not to believe; second, that our government will never establish a religion; and, third, that there will never be a test for qualification for public office involving one's religious beliefs. Making a religious test for public office or even a religious test for immigration is inconsistent with those basic values--inconsistent with those four freedoms. Yet even in this Presidential campaign today, we hear candidates making that proposal. Freedom of speech means allowing others to speak, too, not shouting down those who think differently than we do. Democracy works better with dialogue, not monologues. Years ago when Loretta and I had our first baby, we faced some terrific medical challenges. Sadly, we had no health insurance. Let me state that as a new father, I was never more frightened in my life. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, 17 million Americans and many millions of American parents are now free from that fear, and they know that if this act is eliminated, as has been proposed by some politicians, there is no alternative, there is no protection, and they will face the kind of fear no family should ever face. This year, instead of voting over and over to kill the Affordable Care Act, I am calling the other party to work to strengthen the law. This law isn't perfect, but together we can make the Affordable Care Act work better for all American families. Freedom fear also means that Americans shouldn't have to worry about getting shot when they are playing in a park, sitting in a movie theater, or attending a Bible study class. Even in an election year, we ought to be able to find commonsense ways to protect Americans from the fear and reality of gun violence. We ought to be able to find a way to keep guns out of the wrong hands without undermining basic Second Amendment rights. We owe it to America's families to try. Seventy-five years ago President Roosevelt saw that America would soon be drawn into war. While he didn't live long enough to see America's ultimate victory in World War II, his promise of the four freedoms helped achieve that victory. As we know, the war ended officially with Japan's unconditional surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. A member of Japan's delegation who attended the surrender went to the ceremony fully expecting to hear how the allies intended to take their vengeance on the defeated Japanese people. Instead, he heard General MacArthur speak about the future of freedom for Japan. Years later, he wrote that it was at that ceremony that he understood that ``we weren't beaten on the battlefield by the dint of superior arms; we were defeated in the spiritual conquest by virtue of a nobler idea.'' That idea--the inherent human dignity of every person--is the belief at the heart of the four freedoms. Those freedoms remain as powerful a weapon for peace and progress today as they were 75 years ago. I hope we will remember that this year. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S7-S8] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT'S ``FOUR FREEDOMS'' SPEECH Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow evening President Obama will come before Congress to deliver his annual State of the Union Address. America has changed a great deal since President Obama delivered his first State of the Union Address 7 years ago. We remember he inherited an economy in free fall. There was a real danger that the United States would face another Great Depression. Instead, we slid into a great recession. The President--President Obama--did all he could to bring our economy back to life. Recent economic indicators show that his strategy moved us in the right direction. More Americans are working. We are seeing prosperity and opportunity return. There are still challenges ahead.

[[page s8]] the last of the four freedoms is the freedom from fear. this illustration shows a mother and father looking at their sleeping children tucked safely into bed. in the coming struggle, president roosevelt said, america would defend itself not just with arms but also with ``the stamina and courage which comes from unshakeable belief in the manner of life that we are defending.'' that is exactly what they did. during world war ii, 16 million americans--one out of every eight-- put on a uniform and fought for the promise of the four freedoms. tens of millions more americans back home joined the fight by planting victory gardens, recycling everything from bacon grease to tin cans, serving as ``soil soldiers'' in the civilian conservation corps, and working in war munitions factories as rosie the riveters. after the war, the ``greatest generation,'' as tom brokaw characterized them, may have given up their uniforms, but they continued their fight for fdr's four freedoms. from the earliest days of the roosevelt administration, franklin and eleanor had worked to rewrite the rules of america's economy to give average workers and families a fighting chance against powerful corporations and entrenched wealthy special interests. they strengthened labor unions to improve workers' pay, working conditions, safety in the workplace, health care, retirement--things we take for granted today. after the war, the same americans who had endured the hardships of the depression and who had saved the world from tyranny went to work and laid the foundation for the creation of the largest middle class and the strongest economy in the history of the world. they built new schools, new homes, new towns, an interstate highway system. at the same time, more americans began to challenge longstanding injustices based on race, creed, gender, and other distinctions. as the historian and author harvey kaye writes, under the leadership of franklin delano roosevelt, america greatly ``expanded the `we' in `we the people.' '' under the leadership of franklin and eleanor roosevelt, americans saved our nation's economy from ruin, saved the world from tyranny, and they did all this while making america freer, more equal, and more democratic than it had ever been. the promise of the four freedoms would inspire not only americans, but it inspired the world. the four freedoms became part of the preamble to the united nations ``universal declaration of human rights.'' that declaration, drafted by a committee chaired by the great stateswoman eleanor roosevelt, represents the first time in history that nations around the world agreed to a list of human rights to be universally protected. my wife loretta and i are honored to include among our friends anna eleanor roosevelt, fdr and eleanor's granddaughter. she lives in maine now, but she spent most of her life living in my home state of illinois. similar to her grandparents, anna eleanor roosevelt is full of optimism, energy, and a fierce love for this nation. she has done so much to advance her grandparents' efforts to make america freer and fairer. i want to say to my friend anna, america remembers and honors your grandparents' legacy. we are a better nation because of what their leadership and sacrifice meant to us. as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of fdr's ``four freedoms'' speech, it is clear that we still have a lot of work to do to make the promise of the four freedoms real. income inequality in america is greater today than at any time since just before the great depression. there are many reasons for america's growing economic inequality, including globalization and technology, but the biggest reason is nearly 40 years of deliberate political decisions to undo the progress of fdr's new deal and concentrate more and more income and wealth in the hands of the few. fdr was right when he said that ``economic laws are not made by nature [but] by human beings.'' i hope this year we can work together to pass laws that will increase economic opportunity for all americans, rebuild america's middle class, and free more americans from the fear of want. fdr said that we americans believe in the four freedoms not just for ourselves but for our families, for those who vote as we do or look like we do, who live in our neighborhoods and attend our same houses of worship, but we believe in the four freedoms for everyone everywhere. an america that believes in freedom of worship doesn't allow one religious group to deny basic rights to others. think about our constitution, which each of us in the senate is sworn to uphold and defend. there are only three references in that great document to the issue of religion. the first is in the bill of rights to guarantee to each of us the right to believe as we wish or not to believe; second, that our government will never establish a religion; and, third, that there will never be a test for qualification for public office involving one's religious beliefs. making a religious test for public office or even a religious test for immigration is inconsistent with those basic values--inconsistent with those four freedoms. yet even in this presidential campaign today, we hear candidates making that proposal. freedom of speech means allowing others to speak, too, not shouting down those who think differently than we do. democracy works better with dialogue, not monologues. years ago when loretta and i had our first baby, we faced some terrific medical challenges. sadly, we had no health insurance. let me state that as a new father, i was never more frightened in my life. thanks to the affordable care act, obamacare, 17 million americans and many millions of american parents are now free from that fear, and they know that if this act is eliminated, as has been proposed by some politicians, there is no alternative, there is no protection, and they will face the kind of fear no family should ever face. this year, instead of voting over and over to kill the affordable care act, i am calling the other party to work to strengthen the law. this law isn't perfect, but together we can make the affordable care act work better for all american families. freedom fear also means that americans shouldn't have to worry about getting shot when they are playing in a park, sitting in a movie theater, or attending a bible study class. even in an election year, we ought to be able to find commonsense ways to protect americans from the fear and reality of gun violence. we ought to be able to find a way to keep guns out of the wrong hands without undermining basic second amendment rights. we owe it to america's families to try. seventy-five years ago president roosevelt saw that america would soon be drawn into war. while he didn't live long enough to see america's ultimate victory in world war ii, his promise of the four freedoms helped achieve that victory. as we know, the war ended officially with japan's unconditional surrender aboard the uss missouri in tokyo bay. a member of japan's delegation who attended the surrender went to the ceremony fully expecting to hear how the allies intended to take their vengeance on the defeated japanese people. instead, he heard general macarthur speak about the future of freedom for japan. years later, he wrote that it was at that ceremony that he understood that ``we weren't beaten on the battlefield by the dint of superior arms; we were defeated in the spiritual conquest by virtue of a nobler idea.'' that idea--the inherent human dignity of every person--is the belief at the heart of the four freedoms. those freedoms remain as powerful a weapon for peace and progress today as they were 75 years ago. i hope we will remember that this year. ____________________",12055

Madam President, after months of delay, last fall we finally were able to see the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, text that corporate lobbyists had access to long before the American people and Members of Congress and their staffs did. After examining the provisions in this deal, it is clear that far too many of these provisions sell out American workers and American jobs. In the months leading up to the release of this deal, I warned that too often our trade agreements as far back as NAFTA and the Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China--not a trade agreement per se, but it had the same effect in many ways--the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the South Korea Free Trade Agreement--these trade agreements amounted to corporate handouts and worker sellouts. I warned our negotiators that they needed to do more to ensure that the deal created a truly level playing field for American workers and American businesses. Unfortunately, that is not what happened, particularly when it comes to standing up for the American auto industry. We hear often about the supposed opportunities that trade agreements will create: opportunities for more jobs, opportunities for small business, opportunities for more exports, and for economic growth. But when I look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership, I don't see these actual--let's call them offensive opportunities--and by ``offensive opportunities'' I mean opportunities for American products to break into new markets. This is not just playing defense, but playing offense so that we can export into these new markets. Cheerleaders for this agreement--whether it is the Wall Street Journal editorial page, most Republicans in the Senate, or whether it is Republican leadership in the House, whether it is corporate CEOs or whether it is the White House--say that new markets will be opened for American cars, but we have heard these empty promises before. Under TPP, many of these new markets will not be opened day one--as in the case of Malaysia and Vietnam. They won't be open in day two or year one or year two. It will be more than a decade until American automakers have full access to these closed markets. The TPP will do nothing to level the playing field with our top competitor, Japan, or to change Japan's distinction as the most closed auto market in the world. We know it has been that in the past. We know it is that today. There is nothing in here that would change or open Japan's market, to sell into the Japanese auto market. Carmakers in Ohio and carmakers across the country will compete with huge numbers of Japanese imports. We don't have it today, and under TPP we won't have the same opportunity to export to Japan. That is because for decades Japan has used barriers other than tariffs to keep their markets closed. Tariffs are one way. They charge huge tariffs, causing the price of the product that you import--let's say into Japan--to be too high for the Japanese to afford, but that is not what Japan does. Their tariffs are already at zero, so an agreement on tariffs will do nothing to create a level playing field. Japan keeps our products out in much more creative ways than tariffs. We have seen this in the wake of the Korean Free Trade Agreement. Even after our trading partners promised to remove these barriers to allow American cars into their market, they often don't. Opening up Japan's market didn't work in the 1980s, it didn't work in the 1990s, and it didn't seem that it will be any different under the Trans- Pacific Partnership. If there aren't new offensives--offensives in the sense of selling into those countries--then I would expect our negotiations at least make sure this trade agreement protected American carmakers and workers from a flood of cheap foreign competition. I would hope they made sure the benefits of the agreement would only go toward its members who have been part of the negotiating process and made concessions, but it is not. It is not just the TPP countries. That is now how I read the text, particularly when it comes to something called the rules of origin for autos. These rules of origin provide provisions to determine how much of a car is made in the TPP region, and TPP rules are weaker than NAFTA's. That means how much of the car is actually made in the TPP countries, how much of the car must be made in the TPP countries to count as a TPP product. That means 62.5 percent of a vehicle must be made in the NAFTA region in order for it to qualify for the benefits of the NAFTA agreement. But only 45 [[Page S11]] percent--much less than NAFTA and in some cases even less than that--of a car has to be made in the TPP region to qualify for the benefits of the agreement. Think about that. Under TPP, less than half a car has to be made in TPP countries, which include Canada, Mexico, and the United States, to receive the benefits of TPP. So what does that mean? That means more than half of the components in the car--more than half of the car--can be made in China. So China can backdoor much of its supply chain into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Then these cars, mostly made in China, will get the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, even though they aren't in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As more countries join TPP, that 45- percent rule will become an even weaker standard, and fewer and fewer of our cars will come from the U.S. auto supply chain. I never thought I would be able to say this, but this agreement makes NAFTA--an agreement I fought hard to defeat 20 years ago--look good. TPP's auto rules were written for Japanese automakers to the benefit of China and at the expense of American auto jobs. TPP will jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans, including up to 600,000 Ohioans, whose jobs depend on the U.S. auto supply chain. These aren't just statistics. We are talking about real workers in real plants in real companies in real communities, in Ohio and across the country, with bills to pay and families to feed. They fought hard to bring the American auto industry back to life. Their hard work made the auto rescue a success. Last year, 2015, was a record year for automakers. We can't pull the rug out from under them now with a trade deal that sells out American auto jobs. Think of what we have done. In 2010, only--maybe fewer than this--10 million vehicles were made in the United States. Today that number is close to 17 million. Chrysler posted 7 percent gains in sales last year. GM and Ford were not far behind with 5 percent. I am proud to say the best-selling American vehicle for 34 years running, the Ford-150, runs on engines produced in Lima, OH. Five years ago the American President, President Obama, did the right thing when he personally committed to saving the American auto industry. If you ask people in Ohio, in Toledo, in Avon Lake, in Cleveland, in Warren, in Lordstown, they know how important the auto rescue was. We were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month at the beginning of President Obama's term. Since the auto rescue, the next year--we have seen job growth in this country for 70 months in a row, 70 consecutive months of job growth starting with the auto rescue. Now I hope the President will do the right thing again and go back to the drawing board on the aspects of this trade deal that we know will cost American auto jobs. I yield the floor.

the south korea free trade agreement--these trade agreements amounted to corporate handouts and worker sellouts. i warned our negotiators that they needed to do more to ensure that the deal created a truly level playing field for american workers and american businesses. unfortunately, that is not what happened, particularly when it comes to standing up for the american auto industry. we hear often about the supposed opportunities that trade agreements will create: opportunities for more jobs, opportunities for small business, opportunities for more exports, and for economic growth. but when i look at the trans-pacific partnership, i don't see these actual--let's call them offensive opportunities--and by ``offensive opportunities'' i mean opportunities for american products to break into new markets. this is not just playing defense, but playing offense so that we can export into these new markets. cheerleaders for this agreement--whether it is the wall street journal editorial page, most republicans in the senate, or whether it is republican leadership in the house, whether it is corporate ceos or whether it is the white house--say that new markets will be opened for american cars, but we have heard these empty promises before. under tpp, many of these new markets will not be opened day one--as in the case of malaysia and vietnam. they won't be open in day two or year one or year two. it will be more than a decade until american automakers have full access to these closed markets. the tpp will do nothing to level the playing field with our top competitor, japan, or to change japan's distinction as the most closed auto market in the world. we know it has been that in the past. we know it is that today. there is nothing in here that would change or open japan's market, to sell into the japanese auto market. carmakers in ohio and carmakers across the country will compete with huge numbers of japanese imports. we don't have it today, and under tpp we won't have the same opportunity to export to japan. that is because for decades japan has used barriers other than tariffs to keep their markets closed. tariffs are one way. they charge huge tariffs, causing the price of the product that you import--let's say into japan--to be too high for the japanese to afford, but that is not what japan does. their tariffs are already at zero, so an agreement on tariffs will do nothing to create a level playing field. japan keeps our products out in much more creative ways than tariffs. we have seen this in the wake of the korean free trade agreement. even after our trading partners promised to remove these barriers to allow american cars into their market, they often don't. opening up japan's market didn't work in the 1980s, it didn't work in the 1990s, and it didn't seem that it will be any different under the trans- pacific partnership. if there aren't new offensives--offensives in the sense of selling into those countries--then i would expect our negotiations at least make sure this trade agreement protected american carmakers and workers from a flood of cheap foreign competition. i would hope they made sure the benefits of the agreement would only go toward its members who have been part of the negotiating process and made concessions, but it is not. it is not just the tpp countries. that is now how i read the text, particularly when it comes to something called the rules of origin for autos. these rules of origin provide provisions to determine how much of a car is made in the tpp region, and tpp rules are weaker than nafta's. that means how much of the car is actually made in the tpp countries, how much of the car must be made in the tpp countries to count as a tpp product. that means 62.5 percent of a vehicle must be made in the nafta region in order for it to qualify for the benefits of the nafta agreement. but only 45 [[page s11]] percent--much less than nafta and in some cases even less than that--of a car has to be made in the tpp region to qualify for the benefits of the agreement. think about that. under tpp, less than half a car has to be made in tpp countries, which include canada, mexico, and the united states, to receive the benefits of tpp. so what does that mean? that means more than half of the components in the car--more than half of the car--can be made in china. so china can backdoor much of its supply chain into the trans-pacific partnership. then these cars, mostly made in china, will get the benefits of the trans-pacific partnership, even though they aren't in the trans-pacific partnership. as more countries join tpp, that 45- percent rule will become an even weaker standard, and fewer and fewer of our cars will come from the u.s. auto supply chain. i never thought i would be able to say this, but this agreement makes nafta--an agreement i fought hard to defeat 20 years ago--look good. tpp's auto rules were written for japanese automakers to the benefit of china and at the expense of american auto jobs. tpp will jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of americans, including up to 600,000 ohioans, whose jobs depend on the u.s. auto supply chain. these aren't just statistics. we are talking about real workers in real plants in real companies in real communities, in ohio and across the country, with bills to pay and families to feed. they fought hard to bring the american auto industry back to life. their hard work made the auto rescue a success. last year, 2015, was a record year for automakers. we can't pull the rug out from under them now with a trade deal that sells out american auto jobs. think of what we have done. in 2010, only--maybe fewer than this--10 million vehicles were made in the united states. today that number is close to 17 million. chrysler posted 7 percent gains in sales last year. gm and ford were not far behind with 5 percent. i am proud to say the best-selling american vehicle for 34 years running, the ford-150, runs on engines produced in lima, oh. five years ago the american president, president obama, did the right thing when he personally committed to saving the american auto industry. if you ask people in ohio, in toledo, in avon lake, in cleveland, in warren, in lordstown, they know how important the auto rescue was. we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month at the beginning of president obama's term. since the auto rescue, the next year--we have seen job growth in this country for 70 months in a row, 70 consecutive months of job growth starting with the auto rescue. now i hope the president will do the right thing again and go back to the drawing board on the aspects of this trade deal that we know will cost american auto jobs. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from arkansas ____________________",7684

Madam President, I am here today with my colleague Senator Cotton to honor Dale Bumpers, a longtime advocate of Arkansas, who passed away on January 1 at the age of 90 after a long life of dedicated public service. He was a soldier and a statesman who came from the small town of Charleston, AR. He did things not because of political pressure but because he believed they were the right things to do. He had a good foundation to understand the needs of Arkansans. He was a businessman, taking over operations at his father's former hardware, furniture, and appliance store, and he was a rancher and an attorney in Charleston, serving, as his memoirs indicate, as ``the best lawyer in a one-lawyer town.'' Following the Supreme Court's decision in the 1954 case Brown v. Board of Education, which outlawed segregation in schools, he advised compliance with the ruling, making it the first school district in the South to fully integrate. He ran against incumbent Governor Winthrop Rockefeller to become the 38th Governor of the State of Arkansas. Four years later, he defeated longtime Senator William Fulbright in a primary before winning a seat in the Senate, a position he held for 24 years. He served as the chairman of the committee on small business from 1987 to 1994 and has a long list of accomplishments. While he ended his Senate service more than a decade before I started serving in this Chamber, my colleagues who served alongside him regularly recall their memories of Senator Bumpers, a legendary orator who had a true gift for public speaking and who would tell stories in a way only a Southern gentleman with a keen sense of humor from smalltown Arkansas could. He was passionate about his convictions and spoke from his heart about matters that he believed in. In tributes to him on the floor during the last days of the 105th Congress, his colleagues described him as one of the most respected Members of this body. He was a champion of the environment, a supporter of the National Institutes of Health, funding the fight against HIV and AIDS, and a constant proponent [[Page S12]] for Arkansans. You could tell by all of the things that bear his name-- the White River National Wildlife Refuge, the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center. His impact on Arkansas agriculture was recognized by the University of Arkansas board of trustees, who renamed the college of agriculture the ``Dale Bumpers College of Agriculture, Food and Life Sciences.'' These are just a few of the many things in Arkansas that reflect his dedication and commitment to our State. Senator Bumpers leaves behind a legacy of public service, civic responsibility, and accomplishments that has undoubtedly made Arkansas a better place to live. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. Mr. COTTON. Madam President, today I am proud to join my fellow Senator from Arkansas, John Boozman, in recognizing Senator Dale Bumpers' service, as well as our majority leader and other Senators who are reminiscing about Senator Bumpers, who passed away earlier this month. Arkansas lost one of its most distinguished public servants when former Senator and Governor Dale Bumpers died at the age of 90. As both a Governor and Senator, Dale Bumpers' tireless dedication to our State began before I was born and spanned many decades. As someone who grew up with Dale Bumpers already in the Senate and who was unable to ever vote for him, I asked my mom Avis about her memories of Senator Bumpers. Like so many, she was quick to remember the oratory skills for which he was so famous--not only in Arkansas but also in Washington and in the Senate, which has had its share of famous orators over its history. But she also had fond memories of him on a personal scale as well from the Mount Nebo Chicken Fry, an annual event just outside my hometown of Dardanelle. In the early 1970s, as a young Governor, Senator Bumpers--then Governor Bumpers--always made it to our chicken fry. And if it weren't for a few obvious clues--such as a State trooper or local photographers taking pictures--you wouldn't have even known he was the top executive of our State, so humble and friendly was he to all the fairgoers. He spent time with each person there and made everyone feel like they had his full attention--the full attention of our Governor. It is an honor to stand here today in the same institution from which he did so much great work for the State of Arkansas. Senator Bumpers was an Arkansas institution himself, and his legacy has outlived his tenure in office. We are grateful for his service and commitment to Arkansas. My thoughts and prayers are with the Bumpers family and with all Arkansans, whom he so faithfully served. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS12,CREC-2016-01-11,114,THEODORE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S12] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THEODORE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, western North Dakota is getting a lot of attention these days because of its vibrant energy economy. But people also need to know about the spectacular landscape and natural beauty that thrives side by side with energy development in my home State. So I want to speak today for a few minutes about a remarkable asset in my home State of North Dakota that was highlighted this past weekend in the New York Times. The Times ranked Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota as fifth on its list of 52 worldwide destinations to visit in 2016. Only Mexico City, Bordeaux in France, the Mediterranean island of Malta, and the Caribbean city of Coral Bay St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands ranked ahead of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Tim Neville for the New York Times wrote of the park: Few presidents have done as much for conservation as Teddy Roosevelt. Fly into Dickinson in western North Dakota to visit the park named after him, where rolling grasslands dotted with bison collapse into the spectacular red, white and gold badlands of tumbling mud coulees. The more than 70,000-square-acre park consists of three parts: The south unit, which is the largest of the two units, the north unit, and the site of Roosevelt's Elkhorn Ranch, which lies between the north and south units. The Little Missouri River meanders through all three sections of the park. Roosevelt captured a colorful picture of life on the Elkhorn Ranch in his 1885 book called ``Hunting Trips of a Ranchman.'' My home ranch-house stands on the river brink. From the low, longer veranda, shaded by leafy cotton-woods, one looks across sand bars and shallows to a strip of meadowland, behind which rises a line of sheer cliffs and grassy plateaus. This veranda is a pleasant place in the summer evenings when a cool breeze stirs along the river and blows in the faces of the tired men, who loll back in their rocking-chairs (what true American does not enjoy a rocking- chair?), book in hand--though they do not often read the books, but rock gently to and fro, gazing sleepily out at the weird-looking buttes opposite, until their sharp outlines grow indistinct and purple in the after-glow of the sunset. Theodore Roosevelt National Park has preserved what Roosevelt saw more than a century ago. For that reason, it gets half a million visitors a year, but more should come to see it, and I believe more will as a result of the New York Times list. Speaking of New York, the Times was the right venue to highlight Teddy Roosevelt's National Park because Teddy Roosevelt was a native son of New York, born in the heart of Manhattan at the dawn of the age of concrete canyons and bustling growth. More than 135 years ago, he fled the hectic pace of New York for the solitude of North Dakota's western Badlands on a hunting trip. During that trip--his first to what was then called the Dakota Territory--he was so taken with the land that he bought a ranch before he left for home. Within a year, back at home in New York, however, tragedy struck in a cruel way. Both Roosevelt's wife and his mother died in the same House on the same day. He was crushed, but being a man of action, he sought to redirect his grief by throwing himself into a new adventure--cattle ranching in North Dakota. He went west and built the Elkhorn Ranch on a plot of land that is now part of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Roosevelt long acknowledged his debt to North Dakota. He said: ``I have always said I would not have been President had it not been for my experience in North Dakota. . . . It was here that the romance of my life began.'' That romance is still alive and well in western North Dakota. I invite travelers from around the world to visit us and see what the New York Times described as a ``century of protecting America's magnificence.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S12] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THEODORE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK Mr. HOEVEN.

He went west and built the Elkhorn Ranch on a plot of land that is now part of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Roosevelt long acknowledged his debt to North Dakota. He said: ``I have always said I would not have been President had it not been for my experience in North Dakota. . . . It was here that the romance of my life began.''

Madam President, western North Dakota is getting a lot of attention these days because of its vibrant energy economy. But people also need to know about the spectacular landscape and natural beauty that thrives side by side with energy development in my home State. So I want to speak today for a few minutes about a remarkable asset in my home State of North Dakota that was highlighted this past weekend in the New York Times. The Times ranked Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota as fifth on its list of 52 worldwide destinations to visit in 2016. Only Mexico City, Bordeaux in France, the Mediterranean island of Malta, and the Caribbean city of Coral Bay St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands ranked ahead of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Tim Neville for the New York Times wrote of the park: Few presidents have done as much for conservation as Teddy Roosevelt. Fly into Dickinson in western North Dakota to visit the park named after him, where rolling grasslands dotted with bison collapse into the spectacular red, white and gold badlands of tumbling mud coulees. The more than 70,000-square-acre park consists of three parts: The south unit, which is the largest of the two units, the north unit, and the site of Roosevelt's Elkhorn Ranch, which lies between the north and south units. The Little Missouri River meanders through all three sections of the park. Roosevelt captured a colorful picture of life on the Elkhorn Ranch in his 1885 book called ``Hunting Trips of a Ranchman.'' My home ranch-house stands on the river brink. From the low, longer veranda, shaded by leafy cotton-woods, one looks across sand bars and shallows to a strip of meadowland, behind which rises a line of sheer cliffs and grassy plateaus. This veranda is a pleasant place in the summer evenings when a cool breeze stirs along the river and blows in the faces of the tired men, who loll back in their rocking-chairs (what true American does not enjoy a rocking- chair?), book in hand--though they do not often read the books, but rock gently to and fro, gazing sleepily out at the weird-looking buttes opposite, until their sharp outlines grow indistinct and purple in the after-glow of the sunset. Theodore Roosevelt National Park has preserved what Roosevelt saw more than a century ago. For that reason, it gets half a million visitors a year, but more should come to see it, and I believe more will as a result of the New York Times list.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS11,CREC-2016-01-11,114,LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S11] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY Officer Shawn Bakr and Deputy Sonny Smith Mr. COTTON. Madam President, this past Saturday, January 9, was Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, a day set aside to honor the men and women who work in law enforcement, keeping our communities safe and enforcing the rule of law, which underpins any free and just society. Recently we have heard a great deal about controversies and scrutiny surrounding law enforcement in many parts of our country. It is easy to be distracted by these stories, but it is important to remember that many are inaccurate, and even the true ones are the exception, not the rule. The rule is officers such as Little Rock Police Officer Shawn Bakr. On Saturday, Officer Bakr spent his Law Enforcement Appreciation Day and his night off working as a security guard at a local restaurant. During his shift, three armed men entered a restaurant and pointed a gun at an employee in an attempted robbery. Officer Bakr's law enforcement instincts kicked in, and he reacted with calm dispatch. He confronted the suspects, who subsequently shot him in the shoulder, yet he bravely managed to return fire and injure one of the robbers. The other two suspects fled but have since been apprehended after a standoff with Little Rock police earlier today. The rule is also county sheriffs such as Johnson County Reserve Deputy Sonny Smith, who died in the line of duty last year after he was shot while responding to a burglary. Deputy Smith confronted danger head-on to protect his fellow Arkansans, and he gave the full measure of devotion to duty that only those called to serve in the front lines can fully understand. The rule is also the large group of Deputy Smith's law enforcement colleagues who stood to the right of the stage, just hours after his death--a place typically reserved for parents--and saluted during his son's high school graduation ceremony so he would feel the support and love of the law enforcement community to which his dad belonged. As a soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan, my soldiers and I knew what it meant to face our enemy head-on, but at the end of our tours, we went home. Many of us worked in much less dangerous jobs at military bases around the country until our next tour or we left the service. For law enforcement officers, there is no end to the tour. They take risks every single day, often for the lengths of their careers. Officer Bakr's and Deputy Smith's actions are heroic by any definition, but to them and to countless other law enforcement officers across the country, that is simply part of the job description. Each day that they go to work, our law enforcement personnel around the country put themselves in harm's way to keep us and our communities safe. So to all of our law enforcement officers, the men and women who serve with the selfless dedication of Shawn Bakr and Sonny Smith, thank you for your service and for your sacrifice. May God bless you and your families and keep you safe. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS13,CREC-2016-01-11,114,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S13-S14] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I understand that later today the House of Representatives will vote to pass a reform of the Freedom of Information Act, which is often referred to by its acronym, FOIA. I wish to say a few words about that legislation. I applaud the effort of the House. I have long believed that it is really important to make sure that the people who actually pay the bills and whom we serve know what government is doing on their behalf. Thus the name of the legislation signed by President Johnson many years ago is the Freedom of Information Act. Too often here in Washington, DC, the people in charge of the information seem to view it as proprietary, as if it were theirs. In a political culture where information is power, they don't want to share that information with the people who actually own it and are the ones who hold the elected officials accountable. An open government is really one of the first prerequisites to a free society, and that is because an open and accessible government is absolutely necessary for Americans to hold their elected officials accountable. Our Founding Fathers, of course, recognized that a truly democratic system depends on an informed citizenry, but Americans cannot do that without the information and transparency that these laws provide. Former Justice William Brandeis famously said that ``sunlight is the best disinfectant.'' I must say, as a person who is conservative, that I believe that rather than passing a bunch of new laws, one of the things we can do to change the behavior here in Washington is to shine a light on the actions of elected officials and the government. When elected officials know that the public is informed and watching, it changes the way people behave, and it usually changes it for the better. Congress has passed numerous pieces of legislation that promote this accountability and transparency of government since President Johnson signed the Freedom of Information Act into law so that good leadership and good governance can flourish. During my time in the Senate and previously when I was the attorney general of Texas, I made government transparency a priority. I pressed for more openness in the Federal Government through commonsense legislation. During the process, I found a partner in those efforts in the Senate. He is somebody who is my ideological opposite, and that is Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont. Senator Leahy and I both embrace the fact that most of the time elected officials and government officials want to trumpet their successes and they want to hide their failures. But the American people deserve to know the good, the bad, and the ugly, and to apply the correctives that are within their power, either in changing those officials or holding those officials accountable. So the legislation that is going to pass the House later today is similar to what we have already passed here in the Senate Judiciary Committee by voice vote in February. It requires Federal agencies to operate under a presumption of openness when considering the release of government information under the Freedom of Information Act. Texas law, for example, presumes that public information held by government is presumptively open. If there is some reason why it should not be disclosed--let's say classified materials or whatever--then it is incumbent upon the agency to raise those concerns and then to have those concerns decided in the process of administering those laws. But the idea is also to reduce the overuse of exemptions to withhold information from the public. I hope this Chamber will soon join our colleagues in the House to consider this important legislation. There may be some things we need to do to fine-tune it. I certainly understand that on national security, for example, or things involving proprietary information--trademark protections and property protections--there may be some areas where we have to make some slight changes. But, essentially, this presumption of openness is important to the functioning of our democratic form of government, and I look forward to our passing the law that [[Page S14]] will be passed by the House Chamber later today. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S13-S14] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT Mr. CORNYN.

But, essentially, this presumption of openness is important to the functioning of our democratic form of government, and I look forward to our passing the law that [[Page S14]] will be passed by the House Chamber later today. ____________________",package_114_238.csv,4416,4416,4484,"[congressional record volume 162, number 6 (monday, january 11, 2016)] [senate] [pages s13-s14] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] freedom of information act mr. cornyn. madam president, i understand that later today the house of representatives will vote to pass a reform of the freedom of information act, which is often referred to by its acronym, foia. i wish to say a few words about that legislation. i applaud the effort of the house. i have long believed that it is really important to make sure that the people who actually pay the bills and whom we serve know what government is doing on their behalf. thus the name of the legislation signed by president johnson many years ago is the freedom of information act. too often here in washington, dc, the people in charge of the information seem to view it as proprietary, as if it were theirs. in a political culture where information is power, they don't want to share that information with the people who actually own it and are the ones who hold the elected officials accountable. an open government is really one of the first prerequisites to a free society, and that is because an open and accessible government is absolutely necessary for americans to hold their elected officials accountable. our founding fathers, of course, recognized that a truly democratic system depends on an informed citizenry, but americans cannot do that without the information and transparency that these laws provide. former justice william brandeis famously said that ``sunlight is the best disinfectant.'' i must say, as a person who is conservative, that i believe that rather than passing a bunch of new laws, one of the things we can do to change the behavior here in washington is to shine a light on the actions of elected officials and the government. when elected officials know that the public is informed and watching, it changes the way people behave, and it usually changes it for the better. congress has passed numerous pieces of legislation that promote this accountability and transparency of government since president johnson signed the freedom of information act into law so that good leadership and good governance can flourish. during my time in the senate and previously when i was the attorney general of texas, i made government transparency a priority. i pressed for more openness in the federal government through commonsense legislation. during the process, i found a partner in those efforts in the senate. he is somebody who is my ideological opposite, and that is senator pat leahy of vermont. senator leahy and i both embrace the fact that most of the time elected officials and government officials want to trumpet their successes and they want to hide their failures. but the american people deserve to know the good, the bad, and the ugly, and to apply the correctives that are within their power, either in changing those officials or holding those officials accountable. so the legislation that is going to pass the house later today is similar to what we have already passed here in the senate judiciary committee by voice vote in february. it requires federal agencies to operate under a presumption of openness when considering the release of government information under the freedom of information act. texas law, for example, presumes that public information held by government is presumptively open. if there is some reason why it should not be disclosed--let's say classified materials or whatever--then it is incumbent upon the agency to raise those concerns and then to have those concerns decided in the process of administering those laws. but the idea is also to reduce the overuse of exemptions to withhold information from the public. i hope this chamber will soon join our colleagues in the house to consider this important legislation. there may be some things we need to do to fine-tune it. i certainly understand that on national security, for example, or things involving proprietary information--trademark protections and property protections--there may be some areas where we have to make some slight changes. but, essentially, this presumption of openness is important to the functioning of our democratic form of government, and i look forward to our passing the law that [[page s14]] will be passed by the house chamber later today. ____________________",4416
CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS12-2,CREC-2016-01-11,114,CONGRATULATING THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY BISON FOOTBALL TEAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S12-S13] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY BISON FOOTBALL TEAM Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, while I have the floor, if I might, I wish to shift gears. I know the Presiding Officer is a sports fan and that in her State they have many wonderful sports teams--football, basketball, and certainly the University of Iowa had an outstanding year this year. I certainly wish to commend them, compliment them on their great team. As a matter of fact, the team I am going to talk about next is going to play that team. I think it is our first or second game of the year next year. I am looking forward to it. I know the Presiding Officer is looking forward to it very much as well, when the North Dakota State University Bison play the University of Iowa. I don't know if the Presiding Officer is--I am sure she is a fan of the University of Iowa and Iowa State and Northern Iowa. They are all great sports programs. I don't know which one is her favorite and may not want to say, but we played Iowa State a few years ago. We play Northern Iowa every year. We have a great rivalry with Northern Iowa. Northern Iowa has a wonderful program--football and basketball. We enjoy playing them every year. This year it looks like they have a very good basketball team and are to be commended on beating North Carolina, the Tar Heels. We will certainly [[Page S13]] want to mention that to our colleagues. I am sure the Presiding Officer probably already has. North Dakota State plays Iowa every year and played Iowa State a few years back and we are very much looking forward to playing the University of Iowa. I wish to take a minute to speak about a resolution I will submit. I am going to talk about it now. The resolution is on behalf of the North Dakota State University Bison, which won a historic fifth consecutive NCAA Division I FCS national football championship on Saturday. Led by coach Chris Klieman, quarterback Carson Wentz, and a solid defensive effort, the Bison clinched the title 37 to 10 over a very talented team from Jacksonville State. The Gamecocks were truly great opponents. They played a fine game, and we congratulate them on a tremendous season as well. With Saturday's win, the Bison became the first football team in the modern era of college football to win five consecutive championships-- five titles in a row. The championships aren't won in a single game but as a result of years of hard work. The Bison overcame injury and adversity to make it back to the title game, and we are tremendously proud of our team, our players, the program, and all of their accomplishments. It was a thrill for my wife Mikey and me to join Bison Nation down in Frisco. The game was in Frisco, TX--a wonderful venue for the game. Having a dedicated fan base helped make their stadium feel a lot like one of our home games at the FARGODOME. It is an amazing experience. The game started with a flyover of a B-52 bomber from the Minot North Dakota Air Force Base. In addition to the thousands of dedicated NDSU fans, Thundar, the Bison mascot, and Corso, an actual bison--an unofficial mascot of the team--made the 1,000-mile trek down to Texas. The Bison had a loyal crew cheering them on, and it helped make this ``drive for five'' season very memorable. Five championships in a row is unprecedented. I want to congratulate the entire Bison community--NDSU's leaders, the coaches, the staff, and these tremendous student athletes, as well as Bison Nation, a wonderful loyal following wherever the Bison team goes. In recognition, I will submit the following resolution in their honor: Whereas the North Dakota State University (referred to in this preamble as ``NDSU'') Bison won the 2015 National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this preamble as the ``NCAA'') Division I Football Championship Subdivision title game in Frisco, Texas, on January 9, 2016, in a decisive victory over the Jacksonville State Gamecocks by a score of 37 to 10; Whereas NDSU has won 13 NCAA football championships; Whereas NDSU has now won five consecutive NCAA Football Championships since 2011, an extraordinary and record-setting achievement in modern collegiate football history; Whereas the NDSU Bison have displayed tremendous resilience and skill over the past 5 seasons, with 71 wins to only 5 losses, including a streak of 33 consecutive winning games; Whereas thousands of Bison fans attended the championship game, reflecting the tremendous spirit and dedication of Bison Nation that has helped propel the success of the team; and Whereas the 2015 NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision title was a victory not only for the NDSU football team, but also for the entire State of North Dakota: Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) congratulates the North Dakota State University Bison football team as the 2015 champion of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Football Championship Subdivision; (2) commends the North Dakota State University players, coaches, and staff for their hard work and dedication on a historic season and for fostering a continuing tradition of athletic and academic excellence; and (3) recognizes the students, alumni, and the loyal fans who supported the Bison in their quest to capture a fifth consecutive Division I national championship trophy for North Dakota State University. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S12-S13] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY BISON FOOTBALL TEAM Mr. HOEVEN.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS15,CREC-2016-01-11,114,TRIBUTE TO RICK CARTER,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S15-S16] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO RICK CARTER Mr. PETERS. Madam President, 8 months ago, as I delivered my maiden speech in the Senate, I discussed how honored I am to have succeeded Senator Carl Levin, a mentor to me and a man who defined what it meant to be a Senator from Michigan--a feeling that has only deepened during the past year that I have served in this body. During his 36 years of service, Senator Levin personally met tens of thousands of Michiganders. He remains beloved by many, including those who might never have had the opportunity to shake his hand or sit down next to him. This is due in no small part to his tireless commitment and accessibility in responding to questions and comments from his constituents, whether those issues arose in person, over the phone, in a letter, or--during the latter half of Senator Levin's tenure--email. Michiganders reaching out to his office knew that they would be heard and that they could expect a thoughtful, honest response about their Senator's positions. These responses--hundreds of thousands a year and millions over the course of Senator Levin's career--were made possible by his correspondence manager, Rick Carter. Rick worked for Senator Levin for almost two decades, and I have had the privilege to have him on my team since early last year. While I have known him for only a year, this has been more than enough time to learn that Rick is a model public servant and a role model for generations of congressional staffers. Rick is humble, thoughtful, and fiercely committed to working behind the scenes to help other staff succeed and to grow. He has been instrumental in establishing my Senate office, and I will be eternally grateful for this honorary Michigander's efforts. Rick grew up in DC. Perhaps his future career was foreshadowed by growing up in the Michigan Park neighborhood. He was a standout student at DeMatha Catholic High School and earned a scholarship at George Washington University, where he studied sociology. During his time at GW, he interned for Congressman John Conyers, a legend of the civil rights movement, current Dean of the House of Representatives, and a man I am honored to call my friend and a Michigan colleague. Graduating from GW in 1995, Rick began what would be a 19-year career with Senator Levin. He worked his way up from the front office and mastered a number of different positions before deciding that managing the correspondence team best allowed him to balance engaging on matters of policy, serving the people of Michigan, and mentoring junior staffers. While Rick has many skills and qualities you might expect from a seasoned staffer, including being an excellent writer, editor, and consummate professional, it is his extraordinary commitment to developing young minds that I wish to focus on for a moment. Rick has helped dozens and perhaps hundreds of young graduates, former interns, and junior staffers find jobs in public service. Along with refining writing skills and polishing resumes, Rick has taught a generation of staffers things they did not learn in college: how to be a professional, how to show up on time, and how to simultaneously function independently as well as part of a team. His former interns are legislative directors, chiefs of staff, and chief counsels. The list of favors he is owed is extensive, but he never asks for anything in return. [[Page S16]] He might ask you to run with him, though. As a charity marathon coach, he has helped raise money to fight AIDS. As a year-round positive influence--and not just during a New Year's resolution season--he is always looking for current and past colleagues to run with him. I will not even begin to speculate on the cumulative pounds lost due to his inspiration. Rick has been a surrogate big brother and father figure for so many staffers. It is especially meaningful that Rick has started his own family with his wife Nakia. Their son Mason and new baby Ryan are lucky to have such a loving, dedicated dad. I wish their entire family the best as Rick starts his own small business to pursue real estate development in the DC area. It is said that the only constant in life is change. While Rick Carter has been a constant in the Michigan delegation for more than two decades and I will miss having him in my office, I deeply appreciate his two decades of service and respect his desire to take on new challenges. Rick Carter will always be a part of both Team Levin and Team Peters. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S15-S16] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO RICK CARTER Mr. PETERS.

Madam President, 8 months ago, as I delivered my maiden speech in the Senate, I discussed how honored I am to have succeeded Senator Carl Levin, a mentor to me and a man who defined what it meant to be a Senator from Michigan--a feeling that has only deepened during the past year that I have served in this body. During his 36 years of service, Senator Levin personally met tens of thousands of Michiganders. He remains beloved by many, including those who might never have had the opportunity to shake his hand or sit down next to him. This is due in no small part to his tireless commitment and accessibility in responding to questions and comments from his constituents, whether those issues arose in person, over the phone, in a letter, or--during the latter half of Senator Levin's tenure--email. Michiganders reaching out to his office knew that they would be heard and that they could expect a thoughtful, honest response about their Senator's positions. These responses--hundreds of thousands a year and millions over the course of Senator Levin's career--were made possible by his correspondence manager, Rick Carter. Rick worked for Senator Levin for almost two decades, and I have had the privilege to have him on my team since early last year. While I have known him for only a year, this has been more than enough time to learn that Rick is a model public servant and a role model for generations of congressional staffers. Rick is humble, thoughtful, and fiercely committed to working behind the scenes to help other staff succeed and to grow. He has been instrumental in establishing my Senate office, and I will be eternally grateful for this honorary Michigander's efforts. Rick grew up in DC. Perhaps his future career was foreshadowed by growing up in the Michigan Park neighborhood. He was a standout student at DeMatha Catholic High School and earned a scholarship at George Washington University, where he studied sociology. During his time at GW, he interned for Congressman John Conyers, a legend of the civil rights movement, current Dean of the House of Representatives, and a man I am honored to call my friend and a Michigan colleague. Graduating from GW in 1995, Rick began what would be a 19-year career with Senator Levin. He worked his way up from the front office and mastered a number of different positions before deciding that managing the correspondence team best allowed him to balance engaging on matters of policy, serving the people of Michigan, and mentoring junior staffers. While Rick has many skills and qualities you might expect from a seasoned staffer, including being an excellent writer, editor, and consummate professional, it is his extraordinary commitment to developing young minds that I wish to focus on for a moment. Rick has helped dozens and perhaps hundreds of young graduates, former interns, and junior staffers find jobs in public service.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS16,CREC-2016-01-11,114,NOMINATION OF SAMUEL HEINS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S16-S17] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NOMINATION OF SAMUEL HEINS Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to call on the Senate and all of my colleagues to allow us to move forward on the nomination of Sam Heins of Minnesota to be the U.S. Ambassador to Norway. The U.S. Ambassador for Sweden has also been held up. Coming from the State of Iowa, which I believe is over 10 percent Scandinavian--over 300,000 people--I think the Presiding Officer understands the importance of our country actually having Ambassadors to these incredibly important allies and nations. It has now been 836 days since there was last a confirmed Ambassador to Norway, one of our most important European allies. Part of this situation was caused by a different nominee who has some issues with the committee and with other Senators. That person has now been replaced, and it has been 166 days since a new nominee went through the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Heins was approved by a voice vote, without any controversy, as was the Ambassador to Sweden. I thank Senators Corker and Cardin and Senators McConnell and Reid for their help in trying to get this through. Unfortunately, these nominations are now being held up by Senator Cruz. Based on my discussions with him, it is not because of the qualifications of these nominees; it is related to, I suppose, other issues. Yet, I note for those Scandinavians out there, Senator Cruz has allowed votes on Ambassadors to other countries. We have Ambassadors in France, in England, in nearly every European nation, but not these two Scandinavian countries. Perhaps people don't understand the importance of these nations because they just think these people wear sweaters all the time. I don't know what they think of Norway and Sweden, but, in fact, Senator Cruz should understand that they are two of our best allies. Norway is one of our country's strongest and most dependable allies. I will speak more about Sweden at another time. I plan to take to the floor repeatedly in the next month to talk about the importance of these allies and to ask Senator Cruz what he does not understand, that these are important allies. Norway was a founding member of the NATO Alliance, and its military has participated in operations with the United States in the Balkans and Afghanistan. Norwegians work alongside Americans in standing up to Russia's provocations in Ukraine, in countering ISIS and the spread of violent extremism, and in strengthening regional cooperation in the Arctic. Norway has been especially strong on the issue of the Ukraine and on the issue with Russia. I know the Presiding Officer, with her background in the military, understands how important that is, and certainly my colleagues across the aisle understand how important it is to have allies that will stand up to Russia. In addition, Norway is an important economic partner. In a letter sent this July by the American Chamber of Commerce in Norway, Norway ``represented the 5th fastest growing source of foreign direct investment in the United States between 2009-2013 and is the 12th largest source of foreign direct investment in the United States overall.'' Right now, the United States of America for over 700 days has said to one of the top investors in our country, one of our best allies in security, ``Sorry. You don't rate getting an ambassador.'' There are also over 300 American companies with a presence in Norway, including 3M of Minnesota, Eli Lilly, General Electric, IBM, McDonald's, and so many others. In October Norway reiterated its commitment to Lockheed Martin with the purchase of an additional 22 F-35s. These Lockheed Martin warplanes will be built at a facility in Fort Worth, TX. I have called this to Senator Cruz's attention. In fact, this is an enormous purchase, the biggest purchase made in the history of the country of Norway. These companies, however, are hindered without a strong ambassador to help facilitate and strengthen economic ties between our two countries. Norway is also playing an important role in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis. Norway has a proud history of providing support to those fleeing conflict. It expects to take in as many as 25,000 refugees this year and has already provided millions of dollars to Greece to help that country respond to the influx of refugees seeking a way to enter Europe. Norway is basically on the frontline of the refugee crisis. All of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about the importance of a strong Europe during this very difficult time. Yet, right now we have no Ambassadors in two of the countries on the frontline involved in these refugee crises, and those are Sweden and Norway. Norway deserves a U.S. Ambassador who understands the country and is deeply committed to the relationship. I believe Mr. Heins is the right person for the job. No one has seriously questioned his qualifications for the job. As a Senator from the State that is home to more people--more than 800,000--of Norwegian heritage than anywhere except Norway itself, I think it is only fitting that the nominee to be the U.S. Ambassador to Norway hail from Minnesota. Of course, there is much more to Sam Heins than his Minnesota heritage. In addition to being an accomplished lawyer, he has demonstrated his devotion to and leadership in the cause of advancing human rights. He founded, organized, and served as the first board chair for the Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights, which monitors and responds to human rights abuses throughout the world. He also cofounded the Center for Victims of Torture, which provides services, research, and advocacy for victims of torture around the world, and continues to serve as a board member. This record of accomplishment is particularly appropriate for someone nominated to be our Ambassador to Norway. Norway has long been an international leader on human rights issues. Mr. Heins' extensive work on human rights and with nongovernmental organizations that support human rights will be extremely helpful in sustaining and building on the strong U.S.-Norweigian partnership in this area. Last year, as we know, Congress was able to find common ground on so many issues. We passed a budget bill, we passed a transportation bill, a historic amount of funding, an increase in funding. We got the bill done on sex trafficking that Senator Cornyn and I worked on so hard. I can go through a list of the work we did together across the aisle. When it comes to foreign relations, our country has always believed that a united front is most important on the world stage. We have a united front when it comes to the countries of Norway and Sweden. We understand they are our true allies. We have a united front on these two Ambassador nominees. They were noncontroversial. They went through the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Corker and Senator Cardin have worked together to make sure they get to the floor, but [[Page S17]] right now Senator Cruz is holding up these nominees for reasons that are completely outside of the qualifications of the nominees. I can say this is not the way we should be conducting world business. I am focusing today on Norway. I will focus on Sweden in the future as I continue to give these speeches. I don't think we can take these countries lightly just because it is cold there and darker in the winter. These are incredibly important allies and trading partners. They deserve to be treated like other European nations. They deserve to have an ambassador from the United States of America. It is time to end this delay and do the work the Senate is supposed to do. Let's move ahead and work to confirm these qualified nominees to represent us abroad. One is a country in Europe that just bought 22 fighter planes from Lockheed Martin. If they had bought 22 fighter planes from the Presiding Officer's State, I believe the Presiding Officer would have looked at the fact that if it is a noncontroversial nominee to a country that invests in the United States of America, that is an ambassador we need to get confirmed, and we would get this done. I ask my colleagues to work with Senator Cruz. The hope is that given that we have seen no other opposition of any significance to these two nominees, we will be able to get this done. He has said to me personally that this is not about the qualifications of the nominees, it is simply other issues that I hope he can resolve within the Republican caucus and with us so we can move forward and so they are not held up any longer. Norway and Sweden deserve Ambassadors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S16-S17] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NOMINATION OF SAMUEL HEINS Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

I can say this is not the way we should be conducting world business. I am focusing today on Norway. I will focus on Sweden in the future as I continue to give these speeches. I don't think we can take these countries lightly just because it is cold there and darker in the winter. These are incredibly important allies and trading partners. They deserve to be treated like other European nations. They deserve to have an ambassador from the United States of America. It is time to end this delay and do the work the Senate is supposed to do. Let's move ahead and work to confirm these qualified nominees to represent us abroad. One is a country in Europe that just bought 22 fighter planes from Lockheed Martin. If they had bought 22 fighter planes from the Presiding Officer's State, I believe the Presiding Officer would have looked at the fact that if it is a noncontroversial nominee to a country that invests in the United States of America, that is an ambassador we need to get confirmed, and we would get this done. I ask my colleagues to work with Senator Cruz. The hope is that given that we have seen no other opposition of any significance to these two nominees, we will be able to get this done. He has said to me personally that this is not about the qualifications of the nominees, it is simply other issues that I hope he can resolve within the Republican caucus and with us so we can move forward and so they are not held up any longer. Norway and Sweden deserve Ambassadors. ____________________",package_114_238.csv,8753,8753,8821,"[congressional record volume 162, number 6 (monday, january 11, 2016)] [senate] [pages s16-s17] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] nomination of samuel heins ms. klobuchar. madam president, i rise today to call on the senate and all of my colleagues to allow us to move forward on the nomination of sam heins of minnesota to be the u.s. ambassador to norway. the u.s. ambassador for sweden has also been held up. coming from the state of iowa, which i believe is over 10 percent scandinavian--over 300,000 people--i think the presiding officer understands the importance of our country actually having ambassadors to these incredibly important allies and nations. it has now been 836 days since there was last a confirmed ambassador to norway, one of our most important european allies. part of this situation was caused by a different nominee who has some issues with the committee and with other senators. that person has now been replaced, and it has been 166 days since a new nominee went through the foreign relations committee. mr. heins was approved by a voice vote, without any controversy, as was the ambassador to sweden. i thank senators corker and cardin and senators mcconnell and reid for their help in trying to get this through. unfortunately, these nominations are now being held up by senator cruz. based on my discussions with him, it is not because of the qualifications of these nominees; it is related to, i suppose, other issues. yet, i note for those scandinavians out there, senator cruz has allowed votes on ambassadors to other countries. we have ambassadors in france, in england, in nearly every european nation, but not these two scandinavian countries. perhaps people don't understand the importance of these nations because they just think these people wear sweaters all the time. i don't know what they think of norway and sweden, but, in fact, senator cruz should understand that they are two of our best allies. norway is one of our country's strongest and most dependable allies. i will speak more about sweden at another time. i plan to take to the floor repeatedly in the next month to talk about the importance of these allies and to ask senator cruz what he does not understand, that these are important allies. norway was a founding member of the nato alliance, and its military has participated in operations with the united states in the balkans and afghanistan. norwegians work alongside americans in standing up to russia's provocations in ukraine, in countering isis and the spread of violent extremism, and in strengthening regional cooperation in the arctic. norway has been especially strong on the issue of the ukraine and on the issue with russia. i know the presiding officer, with her background in the military, understands how important that is, and certainly my colleagues across the aisle understand how important it is to have allies that will stand up to russia. in addition, norway is an important economic partner. in a letter sent this july by the american chamber of commerce in norway, norway ``represented the 5th fastest growing source of foreign direct investment in the united states between 2009-2013 and is the 12th largest source of foreign direct investment in the united states overall.'' right now, the united states of america for over 700 days has said to one of the top investors in our country, one of our best allies in security, ``sorry. you don't rate getting an ambassador.'' there are also over 300 american companies with a presence in norway, including 3m of minnesota, eli lilly, general electric, ibm, mcdonald's, and so many others. in october norway reiterated its commitment to lockheed martin with the purchase of an additional 22 f-35s. these lockheed martin warplanes will be built at a facility in fort worth, tx. i have called this to senator cruz's attention. in fact, this is an enormous purchase, the biggest purchase made in the history of the country of norway. these companies, however, are hindered without a strong ambassador to help facilitate and strengthen economic ties between our two countries. norway is also playing an important role in addressing the syrian refugee crisis. norway has a proud history of providing support to those fleeing conflict. it expects to take in as many as 25,000 refugees this year and has already provided millions of dollars to greece to help that country respond to the influx of refugees seeking a way to enter europe. norway is basically on the frontline of the refugee crisis. all of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about the importance of a strong europe during this very difficult time. yet, right now we have no ambassadors in two of the countries on the frontline involved in these refugee crises, and those are sweden and norway. norway deserves a u.s. ambassador who understands the country and is deeply committed to the relationship. i believe mr. heins is the right person for the job. no one has seriously questioned his qualifications for the job. as a senator from the state that is home to more people--more than 800,000--of norwegian heritage than anywhere except norway itself, i think it is only fitting that the nominee to be the u.s. ambassador to norway hail from minnesota. of course, there is much more to sam heins than his minnesota heritage. in addition to being an accomplished lawyer, he has demonstrated his devotion to and leadership in the cause of advancing human rights. he founded, organized, and served as the first board chair for the minnesota advocates for human rights, which monitors and responds to human rights abuses throughout the world. he also cofounded the center for victims of torture, which provides services, research, and advocacy for victims of torture around the world, and continues to serve as a board member. this record of accomplishment is particularly appropriate for someone nominated to be our ambassador to norway. norway has long been an international leader on human rights issues. mr. heins' extensive work on human rights and with nongovernmental organizations that support human rights will be extremely helpful in sustaining and building on the strong u.s.-norweigian partnership in this area. last year, as we know, congress was able to find common ground on so many issues. we passed a budget bill, we passed a transportation bill, a historic amount of funding, an increase in funding. we got the bill done on sex trafficking that senator cornyn and i worked on so hard. i can go through a list of the work we did together across the aisle. when it comes to foreign relations, our country has always believed that a united front is most important on the world stage. we have a united front when it comes to the countries of norway and sweden. we understand they are our true allies. we have a united front on these two ambassador nominees. they were noncontroversial. they went through the foreign relations committee. senator corker and senator cardin have worked together to make sure they get to the floor, but [[page s17]] right now senator cruz is holding up these nominees for reasons that are completely outside

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS14,CREC-2016-01-11,114,GUN CONTROL AND MENTAL ILLNESS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S14-S15] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN CONTROL AND MENTAL ILLNESS Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the main reason I come to the floor today is to talk about the President's most recent Executive action, this time implementing gun control measures that won't actually solve any of the problems they purport to fix and that purposely go around Congress and ignore the will of the American people. To my mind, this is one of the most aggravating things about Washington, DC, and about how business is done here. People make symbolic acts claiming that we have to ``do something'' but don't actually focus on a solution that actually helps make the problem better. None of the President's proposals actually would reduce any of the horrific incidents of gun violence we have seen, and that is a shame because there are bipartisan proposals that have been made that actually would help. But it is only when the President works with the Congress, as the Constitution requires, before a bill can become law. In his eagerness to go it alone, of course, the President has forsaken the constitutional process and bypassed the electorate in trying to make new policy. He presumably is doing this as a hallmark of his tenure, and it will somehow be a legacy of his time as President. But the fact of the matter is Executive action signed by this President will not survive his own Presidency unless it is actually made into law, and then, of course, it would require another act of Congress to overcome it. That is something this President doesn't seem to recognize. When he gets frustrated with the pace at which Congress takes up legislation--for example, the immigration issue--he decides to unilaterally issue an Executive action--which does what? Well, he offers Executive actions as a solution to a problem. But, in fact, what it does is it buys a lawsuit and it gets caught up in litigation, which is going to take years to resolve and ultimately doesn't provide any relief to the very people the President claims to want to help. So as a result of the President's impatience and his eagerness to go it alone, he is actually forsaking the constitutional process that builds consensus and actually creates durable policies that will survive this President's own administration. This isn't just an isolated event, as I mentioned a moment ago. According to one media report, the Obama administration aims to push almost 4,000 new regulations during his last year as President. But with his announcement last week, President Obama made clear he has little interest in working with Congress. That is actually his job--to work with Congress, to work with us to try to find consensus and to build durable solutions to the problems that confront our Nation. It also demonstrates his lack of regard for fundamental constitutional rights as spelled out in the Constitution itself. Of course, I am talking about the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I found his rhetoric particularly perplexing. First, he blamed the Congress for inaction. He said: ``Congress still needs to act.'' Well, actually, if what he was doing was going to solve the problem, why would Congress still need to act? So to me it is an admission that he knows that this is mere symbolism and it doesn't actually solve the problem that he says exists. So he said Congress still needs to act on gun control measures, and he claimed that this legislative body--the Congress--is simply not being responsive to the will of the American people. He even said that he feels compelled to act without consulting Congress because America doesn't ``have a Congress that is in line with the majority of Americans.'' In other words, the President said the people of this country are demanding more symbolic gun control laws, not less. But that is not what the polling shows, the best indicator of what people are actually thinking--other than what the Presiding Officer hears from her constituents in Iowa and I hear from my constituents in Texas. Those are the best ways to know what people are thinking. In a poll done by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News this fall, more than half of the respondents said that the President's party's position on gun control was ``outside the mainstream.'' Only 38 percent said that it was ``within the mainstream.'' It is also critical to point out that, as many media reports have indicated, the President's measures would not have stopped any of the mass violence incidents that have tragically struck American communities over the last few years. So my response to the President is this: If he is actually serious about trying to solve problems rather than just issue symbolic proclamations, he needs to roll up his sleeves and he needs to work with us to move legislation forward that focuses on the commonsense thread found in many of these mass incidents, and that has to do with the mental health issue. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room that the President doesn't want to talk about. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, has made it quite clear that this is the one issue where we could actually find consensus and help provide assistance to families and communities to help people from becoming a danger to themselves as well as the communities in which they live. We know from the facts of the cases that many times the mental health of the shooter has played a role in many of these tragedies, and it must be addressed. Many Americans, of course, agree. I think, for example, of Adam Lanza, who was the shooter at Sandy Hook in Connecticut. He was so mentally ill that he was a recluse in his own home, and the only thing his mother found she could engage him in was going out to a shooting range. Yet he basically stole his mother's own weapons, killed her, and then tragically went to Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed a number of innocent children. If he and she had been able to get some additional help--gotten him to a doctor and gotten him on medications that could have helped him from this increasing mental illness--then perhaps things would have turned out differently. That is speculation on all our parts, but perhaps treating the mental illness will actually reduce the likelihood that people will succumb to an impulse to do harm to themselves and to their communities. According to a poll released just last week, more than 70 percent of Americans said they believe that better access to mental health treatment and screening would reduce these incidents of violence. I am part of that 70 percent. I firmly believe that time and again we are confronted with mental illness crises that go untreated and turn into tragic headlines. We can't responsibly stand by any longer and watch this pattern repeat itself. That is why last year I introduced a piece of legislation that was my effort to try to begin this conversation and this discussion here in the Senate. There are other ideas. The chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Alexander, and the ranking member, Senator Murray, are working on some mental health reform legislation. Congressman Tim Murphy in the House has worked on a comprehensive bill, and in the Senate Dr. Bill Cassidy is working on that legislation. My legislation, hopefully, will help contribute to the conversation and help us build that consensus that is so important. The legislation I have introduced would improve treatment and preventive screenings and crisis response for individuals with mental illness. It would also strengthen the existing background check system, something the President says he wants to do. However, the fact of the matter is that many States, such as the State of Virginia in the case of the Virginia Tech shooter just a short time ago, don't even upload existing mental health adjudications into the background check system, which would have precluded the purchase of a firearm by somebody with that sort of record. So the National Instant Criminal Background Check System isn't even a comprehensive system when it comes to identifying people who under current law should not be able to purchase a firearm. This legislation I have offered is a step forward that will help those with mental illness get the support they need while also equipping our Nation's [[Page S15]] law enforcement officers to help keep our communities safe. It has been endorsed by a diverse group of organizations, including the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the National Association of Social Workers. I think the thing that has perhaps offended some of our Democratic colleagues is that we have actually been able to build a consensus, where none other has existed on this topic, by getting organizations such as the ones I mentioned, along with the National Rifle Association, to endorse the legislation I have introduced. The fact of the matter is this legislation was aided by solutions borrowed from what is happening in Texas and particularly Bexar County and San Antonio, where I once served as a district judge. I firmly believe that the best way we can legislate here is to learn what works at the local and State level and then to scale them up here at the national level, rather than to do what the President seems to prefer, which is a national experiment and a one-size-fits-all approach in a country that is simply too diverse on issues that are so complex that we can't really solve them with the wave of a magic wand or on a national basis. So let's look at what works locally and in our States and then bring those experiences here and scale them up for the benefit of the rest of the country. The fact of the matter is that Bexar County's and San Antonio's mental health program is now touted as the national standard for how to think strategically about those suffering from mental illness in the criminal justice system. Sheriff Pamerleau of Bexar County told me that a substantial portion of the jail population in San Antonio is people suffering from mental illness. Many times they go untreated and, thus, they try to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol, just making their condition that much worse. But the underlying cause of their problem is never being treated, which is the underlying mental illness. I have heard the same story in Houston and Austin and other places. I have asked our law enforcement professionals--we simply are seeing more and more people with mental illnesses showing up in emergency rooms or living homeless on the street or ending up in our jails without their problems adequately being addressed. My legislation does try to take a crack at that. It may not be perfect. I know other people will have other ideas, but at least it is a constructive suggestion and will hopefully begin a conversation that we need to have and the President says he wants to have but so far has neglected to engage in. Congress has a role to play because we represent the American people and we represent the States where we are elected to serve. It is our responsibility to try to bring about successful reforms that we have seen work at the local and State levels. I am hopeful the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing soon. I understand we may well begin by the end of this month, and it is not a minute too soon. We need a President who is willing to get to work and do his job and not just to make speeches or issue Executive orders and say: Well, look, I have done my part, and the rest is up to everybody else. We need a President who is willing to work with us and alongside of us to tackle these important issues and hopefully help protect the individuals who are suffering from mental illness, to give families more choices when dealing with a mentally ill loved one, and also hopefully to avoid these incidents of mass violence. What we don't need is purporting to govern by Executive edict, which is what the President seems to like and prefer. I hope the President understands that Members on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers are ready, willing, and able in good faith to work to reform our mental health system and in doing so help prevent some of the tragedies that are occurring in our communities. What we don't need to do is to restrict the constitutional rights of law- abiding citizens, which will in no way make our communities safer but will infringe upon those constitutional rights in the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. Many of the bills proposed, including mine, go much further than what the President announced last week in dealing with mental illness. There is a lot of work that needs to be done, and we need a President who will work with us. If he is willing to abandon this go-it-alone attitude and commit to working with the elected representatives of the American people, I think we have the opportunity to accomplish a lot for our country. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S14-S15] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN CONTROL AND MENTAL ILLNESS Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, the main reason I come to the floor today is to talk about the President's most recent Executive action, this time implementing gun control measures that won't actually solve any of the problems they purport to fix and that purposely go around Congress and ignore the will of the American people. To my mind, this is one of the most aggravating things about Washington, DC, and about how business is done here. People make symbolic acts claiming that we have to ``do something'' but don't actually focus on a solution that actually helps make the problem better. None of the President's proposals actually would reduce any of the horrific incidents of gun violence we have seen, and that is a shame because there are bipartisan proposals that have been made that actually would help. But it is only when the President works with the Congress, as the Constitution requires, before a bill can become law. In his eagerness to go it alone, of course, the President has forsaken the constitutional process and bypassed the electorate in trying to make new policy. He presumably is doing this as a hallmark of his tenure, and it will somehow be a legacy of his time as President. But the fact of the matter is Executive action signed by this President will not survive his own Presidency unless it is actually made into law, and then, of course, it would require another act of Congress to overcome it. That is something this President doesn't seem to recognize. When he gets frustrated with the pace at which Congress takes up legislation--for example, the immigration issue--he decides to unilaterally issue an Executive action--which does what? Well, he offers Executive actions as a solution to a problem. But, in fact, what it does is it buys a lawsuit and it gets caught up in litigation, which is going to take years to resolve and ultimately doesn't provide any relief to the very people the President claims to want to help. So as a result of the President's impatience and his eagerness to go it alone, he is actually forsaking the constitutional process that builds consensus and actually creates durable policies that will survive this President's own administration. This isn't just an isolated event, as I mentioned a moment ago. According to one media report, the Obama administration aims to push almost 4,000 new regulations during his last year as President. But with his announcement last week, President Obama made clear he has little interest in working with Congress. That is actually his job--to work with Congress, to work with us to try to find consensus and to build durable solutions to the problems that confront our Nation. It also demonstrates his lack of regard for fundamental constitutional rights as spelled out in the Constitution itself. Of course, I am talking about the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I found his rhetoric particularly perplexing. First, he blamed the Congress for inaction. He said: ``Congress still needs to act.'' Well, actually, if what he was doing was going to solve the problem, why would Congress still need to act? So to me it is an admission that he knows that this is mere symbolism and it doesn't actually solve the problem that he says exists. So he said Congress still needs to act on gun control measures, and he claimed that this legislative body--the Congress--is simply not being responsive to the will of the American people. He even said that he feels compelled to act without consulting Congress because America doesn't ``have a Congress that is in line with the majority of Americans.'' In other words, the President said the people of this country are demanding more symbolic gun control laws, not less. But that is not what the polling shows, the best indicator of what people are actually thinking--other than what the Presiding Officer hears from her constituents in Iowa and I hear from my constituents in Texas. Those are the best ways to know what people are thinking. In a poll done by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News this fall, more than half of the respondents said that the President's party's position on gun control was ``outside the mainstream.'' Only 38 percent said that it was ``within the mainstream.'' It is also critical to point out that, as many media reports have indicated, the President's measures would not have stopped any of the mass violence incidents that have tragically struck American communities over the last few years. So my response to the President is this: If he is actually serious about trying to solve problems rather than just issue symbolic proclamations, he needs to roll up his sleeves and he needs to work with us to move legislation forward that focuses on the commonsense thread found in many of these mass incidents, and that has to do with the mental health issue. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room that the President doesn't want to talk about. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, has made it quite clear that this is the one issue where we could actually find consensus and help provide assistance to families and communities to help people from becoming a danger to themselves as well as the communities in which they live. We know from the facts of the cases that many times the mental health of the shooter has played a role in many of these tragedies, and it must be addressed. Many Americans, of course, agree. I think, for example, of Adam Lanza, who was the shooter at Sandy Hook in Connecticut. He was so mentally ill that he was a recluse in his own home, and the only thing his mother found she could engage him in was going out to a shooting range. Yet he basically stole his mother's own weapons, killed her, and then tragically went to Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed a number of innocent children. If he and she had been able to get some additional help--gotten him to a doctor and gotten him on medications that could have helped him from this increasing mental illness--then perhaps things would have turned out differently. That is speculation on all our parts, but perhaps treating the mental illness will actually reduce the likelihood that people will succumb to an impulse to do harm to themselves and to their communities. According to a poll released just last week, more than 70 percent of Americans said they believe that better access to mental health treatment and screening would reduce these incidents of violence. I am part of that 70 percent. I firmly believe that time and again we are confronted with mental illness crises that go untreated and turn into tragic headlines. We can't responsibly stand by any longer and watch this pattern repeat itself. That is why last year I introduced a piece of legislation that was my effort to try to begin this conversation and this discussion here in the Senate. There are other ideas. The chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Alexander, and the ranking member, Senator Murray, are working on some mental health reform legislation. Congressman Tim Murphy in the House has worked on a comprehensive bill, and in the Senate Dr. Bill Cassidy is working on that legislation. My legislation, hopefully, will help contribute to the conversation and help us build that consensus that is so important. The legislation I have introduced would improve treatment and preventive screenings and crisis response for individuals with mental illness. It would also strengthen the existing background check system, something the President says he wants to do. However, the fact of the matter is that many States, such as the State of Virginia in the case of the Virginia Tech shooter just a short time ago, don't even upload existing mental health adjudications into the background check system, which would have precluded the purchase of a firearm by somebody with that sort of record. So the National Instant Criminal Background Check System isn't even a comprehensive system when it comes to identifying people who under current law should not be able to purchase a firearm. This legislation I have offered is a step forward that will help those with mental illness get the support they need while also equipping our Nation's [[Page S15]] law enforcement officers to help keep our communities safe. It has been endorsed by a diverse group of organizations, including the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the National Association of Social Workers. I think the thing that has perhaps offended some of our Democratic colleagues is that we have actually been able to build a consensus, where none other has existed on this topic, by getting organizations such as the ones I mentioned, along with the National Rifle Association, to endorse the legislation I have introduced. The fact of the matter is this legislation was aided by solutions borrowed from what is happening in Texas and particularly Bexar County and San Antonio, where I once served as a district judge. I firmly believe that the best way we can legislate here is to learn what works at the local and State level and then to scale them up here at the national level, rather than to do what the President seems to prefer, which is a national experiment and a one-size-fits-all approach in a country that is simply too diverse on issues that are so complex that we can't really solve them with the wave of a magic wand or on a national basis. So let's look at what works locally and in our States and then bring those experiences here and scale them up for the benefit of the rest of the country. The fact of the matter is that Bexar County's and San Antonio's mental health program is now touted as the national standard for how to think strategically about those suffering from mental illness in the criminal justice system. Sheriff Pamerleau of Bexar County told me that a substantial portion of the jail population in San Antonio is people suffering from mental illness. Many times they go untreated and, thus, they try to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol, just making their condition that much worse. But the underlying cause of their problem is never being treated, which is the underlying mental illness. I have heard the same story in Houston and Austin and other places. I have asked our law enforcement professionals--we simply are seeing more and more people with mental illnesses showing up in emergency rooms or living homeless on the street or ending up in our jails without their problems adequately being addressed. My legislation does try to take a crack at that. It may not be perfect. I know other people will have other ideas, but at least it is a constructive suggestion and will hopefully begin a conversation that we need to have and the President says he wants to have but so far has neglected to engage in. Congress has a role to play because we represent the American people and we represent the States where we are elected to serve. It is our responsibility to try to bring about successful reforms that we have seen work at the local and State levels. I am hopeful the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing soon. I understand we may well begin by the end of this month, and it is not a minute too soon. We need a President who is willing to get to work and do his job and not just to make speeches or issue Executive orders and say: Well, look, I have done my part, and the rest is up to everybody else. We need a President who is willing to work with us and alongside of us to tackle these important issues and hopefully help protect the individuals who are suffering from mental illness, to give families more choices when dealing with a mentally ill loved one, and also hopefully to avoid these incidents of mass violence. What we don't need is purporting to govern by Executive edict, which is what the President seems to like and prefer. I hope the President understands that Members on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers are ready, willing, and able in good faith to work to reform our mental health system and in doing so help prevent some of the tragedies that are occurring in our communities. What we don't need to do is to restrict the constitutional rights of law- abiding citizens, which will in no way make our communities safer but will infringe upon those constitutional rights in the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. Many of the bills proposed, including mine, go much further than what the President announced last week in dealing with mental illness. There is a lot of work that needs to be done, and we need a President who will work with us. If he is willing to abandon this go-it-alone attitude and commit to working with the elected representatives of the American people, I think we have the opportunity to accomplish a lot for our country. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Luis Felipe Restrepo, of Pennsylvania, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the upcoming confirmation vote of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I wish to thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for moving Judge Restrepo's nomination through their committee. I also thank Leader McConnell for scheduling this confirmation vote, which will take place in short order. I also wish to thank my colleague Senator Casey. Senator Casey and I have been working very closely for 5 years now, since I joined the Senate, working to fill the vacancies that occur on the Federal bench across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that we represent. With Judge Restrepo's confirmation tonight, which I am hopeful and confident will occur, Senator Casey and I will have been able to play a role in filling 16 vacancies on the Federal bench, including 14 district court vacancies that have occurred since the time I arrived in Senate and two Third Circuit court vacancies. There are only two States in the Union that have had more vacancies filled in the last 5 years, and those two States are California and New York. They are very large States, of course, and have a large number of vacancies. Again, I thank Senator Casey for the very constructive working relationship we have developed to make sure that the people of Pennsylvania are able to access justice in a sensible and efficient fashion. Because we have worked closely together, not only have we filled these vacancies, but we have filled courthouses--Federal courthouses meant to house Federal judges--that have been vacant for years. As a result, Reading, PA, now has a Federal judge serving in that courthouse. People in the surrounding area of Williamsport, PA, had to drive great distances to get to a Federal court, and now there is a judge serving in Williamsport. Easton, PA--likewise, the people in North Hampton County who had to drive all the way to Philadelphia to have a case dealt with can now do that in Easton. I think, and I hope, we are close to filling an empty courthouse in Erie, PA. Erie is kind of by itself out there in the northwest corner of our great State, and there ought to be Federal judge in the Erie courthouse. We are well in the process of making sure that there will be, and I am sure it will come to a close soon. Back to Judge Restrepo. The fact is Judge Restrepo is very well qualified to serve on the Third Circuit. He has served as a Federal district court judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania since June of 2013. I was very pleased, along with Senator Casey, to have recommended Judge Restrepo to the White House for that post and to have supported his confirmation to the district court. In 2013, Judge Restrepo was confirmed unanimously on the Senate floor. I would love to see that occur again this evening with respect to his confirmation to the circuit court. Prior to his appointment as a district court judge, Judge Restrepo served for 7 years as a Federal magistrate judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and for 13 years prior to that, Judge Restrepo was a partner in the law firm of Krasner and Restrepo, handling criminal defense cases. Before that, he worked at the public defenders' office at the Federal and State levels. In many ways, Judge Restrepo's life story is a classic American dream story. He was born in Medellin, Colombia, and became a U.S. citizen in 1993. He has devoted a great deal of his time and energy and considerable intellect to serving his community. He served on the board of the Make-a-Wish Foundation for Philadelphia and Susquehanna Valley. This is a foundation that grants wishes to children who have life- threatening illnesses. Judge Restrepo also gave his time to the Russell Byers Charter School in Philadelphia. I am very confident that Judge Restrepo has the judicial experience, legal acumen, intellect, integrity, and dedication to public service to do the job that we expect him to do on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The Senate Judiciary Committee apparently shares my confidence, having passed his nomination out of committee with a voice vote. I am pleased to speak on behalf of this highly qualified nominee, and I urge all of my colleagues to support his confirmation.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S17] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman).

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the upcoming confirmation vote of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I wish to thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for moving Judge Restrepo's nomination through their committee. I also thank Leader McConnell for scheduling this confirmation vote, which will take place in short order. I also wish to thank my colleague Senator Casey. Senator Casey and I have been working very closely for 5 years now, since I joined the Senate, working to fill the vacancies that occur on the Federal bench across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that we represent. With Judge Restrepo's confirmation tonight, which I am hopeful and confident will occur, Senator Casey and I will have been able to play a role in filling 16 vacancies on the Federal bench, including 14 district court vacancies that have occurred since the time I arrived in Senate and two Third Circuit court vacancies. There are only two States in the Union that have had more vacancies filled in the last 5 years, and those two States are California and New York. They are very large States, of course, and have a large number of vacancies. Again, I thank Senator Casey for the very constructive working relationship we have developed to make sure that the people of Pennsylvania are able to access justice in a sensible and efficient fashion. Because we have worked closely together, not only have we filled these vacancies, but we have filled courthouses--Federal courthouses meant to house Federal judges--that have been vacant for years. As a result, Reading, PA, now has a Federal judge serving in that courthouse. People in the surrounding area of Williamsport, PA, had to drive great distances to get to a Federal court, and now there is a judge serving in Williamsport. Easton, PA--likewise, the people in North Hampton County who had to drive all the way to Philadelphia to have a case dealt with can now do that in Easton. I think, and I hope, we are close to filling an empty courthouse in Erie, PA. Erie is kind of by itself out there in the northwest corner of our great State, and there ought to be Federal judge in the Erie courthouse. We are well in the process of making sure that there will be, and I am sure it will come to a close soon. Back to Judge Restrepo. The fact is Judge Restrepo is very well qualified to serve on the Third Circuit. He has served as a Federal district court judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania since June of 2013. I was very pleased, along with Senator Casey, to have recommended Judge Restrepo to the White House for that post and to have supported his confirmation to the district court. In 2013, Judge Restrepo was confirmed unanimously on the Senate floor. I would love to see that occur again this evening with respect to his confirmation to the circuit court. Prior to his appointment as a district court judge, Judge Restrepo served for 7 years as a Federal magistrate judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and for 13 years prior to that, Judge Restrepo was a partner in the law firm of Krasner and Restrepo, handling criminal defense cases. Before that, he worked at the public defenders' office at the Federal and State levels. In many ways, Judge Restrepo's life story is a classic American dream story. He was born in Medellin, Colombia, and became a U.S. citizen in 1993. He has devoted a great deal of his time and energy and considerable intellect to serving his community. He served on the board of the Make-a-Wish Foundation for Philadelphia and Susquehanna Valley. This is a foundation that grants wishes to children who have life- threatening illnesses. Judge Restrepo also gave his time to the Russell Byers Charter School in Philadelphia. I am very confident that Judge Restrepo has the judicial experience, legal acumen, intellect, integrity, and dedication to public service to do the job that we expect him to do on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The Senate Judiciary Committee apparently shares my confidence, having passed his nomination out of committee with a voice vote. I am pleased to speak on behalf of this highly qualified nominee, and I urge all of my colleagues to support his confirmation.",package_114_238.csv,4950,4950,5018,"[congressional record volume 162,

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS17-2,CREC-2016-01-11,114,Tribute to Officer Jesse Hartnett (Executive Session),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S17-S19] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Tribute to Officer Jesse Hartnett Mr. President, I wish to briefly address one other item this evening before I yield the floor. I want to speak about the appalling shooting that occurred in Philadelphia just last Thursday evening when a shooter attempted to assassinate a police officer in the name of ISIS on the streets of Philadelphia. The shooter wasn't counting on the amazing bravery of Philadelphia Police Officer Jesse Hartnett. It was late, about 11:30 at night on Thursday, and apparently a man waved down Jesse Hartnett as he was driving along in his police cruiser. Officer Hartnett stopped the cruiser. The man walked over as if to ask for directions, and instead, out of the blue, he started firing shots at pointblank range into the driver's side window at Officer Hartnett. He kept walking up to the car. As he walked, he kept shooting. At one point he actually had his arm, with the gun, inside the window of the car and was still shooting. In total, the shooter fired 13 shots. Cameras that happened to be in that area captured the incident. It is absolutely amazing that Officer Hartnett managed to survive. It is amazing. But he didn't just survive. He jumped out of his patrol car. He had been hit three times and was very seriously injured. His arm was bleeding profusely. He got out of his car and chased down the shooter. He shot and wounded the would-be killer, and because of his heroic action while literally under fire, the shooter was apprehended. This is an amazing example of true grit, and the people of Pennsylvania couldn't be more proud of Officer Hartnett. Our prayers are certainly with Officer Hartnett and his family. He has a very difficult recovery ahead of him. He has already had one surgery. My understanding is that he has undergone a second surgery today, or is in the process of undergoing that surgery. The [[Page S18]] doctors are trying to save his arm, which was badly injured. I want to be clear about this. What happened that Thursday night was an act of terrorism. It was an act of terrorism inspired by violent Islamic extremism. The shooter reportedly declared that he had pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State. He said that he was targeting police officers because he believes that the police are defending and enforcing laws that are contrary to the Koran, and the shooter himself said that he acted in the name of Islam and the Islamic State. We don't know for sure yet whether the shooter has direct personal ties to ISIS abroad, but the FBI has reported that the shooter traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2011 and then went to Egypt for several months in 2012. Regardless of what he was doing over there or what his purpose was, we should make no mistake; this was an act of terrorism just as the shootings at Fort Hood and San Bernardino were. Let me be abundantly clear. I think everyone obviously knows that this cop killer--this would-be cop killer--doesn't represent all Muslims. No one would suggest that, but he does represent a terrible strain of violent Islamic extremism, a strain that has amassed millions of dollars, has followers all around the planet, and is, in fact, at war with America. ISIS and the violent Islamic extremists that are followers of ISIS pose a very serious threat to America. We have seen this repeatedly now, including in my home State of Pennsylvania in the City of Philadelphia. We are very fortunate. We have incredibly courageous law enforcement officers, such as Officer Hartnett, protecting us, but we shouldn't in any way diminish the magnitude and gravity of this threat. I commend Officer Jesse Hartnett for his bravery. To Officer Hartnett and his family, please know that the people of Pennsylvania are behind you, thinking of you, and praying for a full and speedy recovery. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the nomination. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to offer some remarks about the vote we are going to cast on Judge Restrepo, which Senator Toomey spoke to earlier, and I thank him for his work on this nomination. We are finally at the point where we are voting, and we are grateful for that opportunity. Senator Toomey has noted and I know others are aware of Judge Restrepo's qualifications. I will highlight a few, some of it by way of reiteration. I will start with the story itself. This is a great American story. An individual came to this country from Colombia and, through hard work and the benefit of a great education, has risen to the point of being a member of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Upon a positive confirmation vote, he will be a member of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the second highest Federal court in the land, just below the Supreme Court. Judge Restrepo is a 1986 graduate of Tulane University Law School. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1981 with a degree in economics and international relations. As I said, he has served as a member of the U.S. district court in Philadelphia, which pretty much covers the eastern half of our State. We have a Middle District and a Western District. He is a judge in one of the three districts. He started there in June of 2013, so his nomination to the appeals court was a rapid rise in the Federal judiciary. Before being on the district court, he served as a U.S. magistrate judge from June of 2006 until his appointment to the U.S. district court. I believe all of the other information is already in the Record, but I want to reiterate what I said before and what I know Senator Toomey has said. This nominee is qualified by way of experience, intellect, and education, but maybe the most important thing is by way of integrity. He is someone who has the character to serve on the appellate court after serving with distinction on the U.S. district court. With that, I yield the floor. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to support the nomination of Judge Luis F. Restrepo, the President's nominee for appointment on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Filling a vacancy on the third circuit is important to New Jerseyans. Because only a handful of cases each year reach the Supreme Court, circuit courts often have the final word in the vast majority of Federal cases. That means, for most of my constituents who bring cases in Federal courts, the buck stops with the third circuit. The third circuit currently has two judicial vacancies. The vacant seat that President nominated Judge Restrepo to fill has been declared a judicial emergency. That means it has a very heavy caseload. In fact the third circuit has more than 900 weighted filings per judgeship. Filling a vacancy on that important Federal appellate court will lower the caseload burden and ensure access to justice for more Americans. Judge Restrepo is a well-qualified individual. There is no question about that. He has over 10 years of experience on the Federal bench. In fact the Senate unanimously confirmed him to serve as a Federal district judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Prior to that, he served as a Federal magistrate judge. As a member of the Federal bench, he has presided over 56 trials that have gone to verdict or judgement. He has a wealth of experience in both public service and private practice. He was a founding member of a Philadelphia law firm, where he practiced both criminal defense and civil rights litigation. He served as an assistant Federal defender with the Community Federal Defender for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and an assistant defender for the Defender Association of Philadelphia. He has relevant experience in both criminal and civil law, which will serve him well as a Federal appellate judge. Judge Restrepo has excellent legal credentials. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania and his law degree from Tulane University Law School. The work of a Federal appellate judge can often be academic as the job requires a judge to address legal issues of first impression. Judge Restrepo has more than two decades of teaching experience at both the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Temple University James E. Beasley School of Law. He also taught with the National Institute for Trial Advocacy. In addition, he has written numerous articles appearing in a variety of national legal publications. He has dedicated his time to public service and to bettering his community. He is the former president of the Hispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania. He served on the board of directors for the Defender Association of Philadelphia and the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Philadelphia and Susquehanna Valley. As a Federal judge, he has also participated in a reentry program to assist people recently released from federal custody to reenter the community and become productive citizens. I believe he has a wealth of relevant experience and a strong legal background. Other Senators share my confidence in Judge Restrepo. He has the bipartisan support from both Pennsylvania Senators and was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous voice vote. Judge Restrepo's confirmation is also historic. He will be the first Latino judge from Pennsylvania to serve on the third circuit and only the second Latino to sit on that court. He also has the strong endorsement of the Hispanic National Bar Association. According to that distinguished organization, Judge Restrepo's ``integrity, knowledge of the law, breadth of professional experience, and intellectual capacity make him well suited to sit as a federal appellate judge.'' I could not agree more. I urge my colleagues to confirm Judge Restrepo to the third circuit today. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be recognized as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be able [[Page S19]] to display on the Senate floor these two vials of liquid nicotine to tell what just passed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S17-S19] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Tribute to Officer Jesse Hartnett Mr. President, I wish to briefly address one other item this evening before I yield the floor.

We are finally at the point where we are voting, and we are grateful for that opportunity. Senator Toomey has noted and I know others are aware of Judge Restrepo's qualifications. I will highlight a few, some of it by way of reiteration. I will start with the story itself. This is a great American story. An individual came to this country from Colombia and, through hard work and the benefit of a great education, has risen to the point of being a member of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Upon a positive confirmation vote, he will be a member of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the second highest Federal court in the land, just below the Supreme Court. Judge Restrepo is a 1986 graduate of Tulane University Law School. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1981 with a degree in economics and international relations. As I said, he has served as a member of the U.S. district court in Philadelphia, which pretty much covers the eastern half of our State. We have a Middle District and a Western District. He is a judge in one of the three districts. He started there in June of 2013, so his nomination to the appeals court was a rapid rise in the Federal judiciary. Before being on the district court, he served as a U.S. magistrate judge from June of 2006 until his appointment to the U.S. district court. I believe all of the other information is already in the Record, but I want to reiterate what I said before and what I know Senator Toomey has said. This nominee is qualified by way of experience, intellect, and education, but maybe the most important thing is by way of integrity. He is someone who has the character to serve on the appellate court after serving with distinction on the U.S. district court. With that, I yield the floor. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to support the nomination of Judge Luis F. Restrepo, the President's nominee for appointment on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Filling a vacancy on the third circuit is important to New Jerseyans. Because only a handful of cases each year reach the Supreme Court, circuit courts often have the final word in the vast majority of Federal cases. That means, for most of my constituents who bring cases in Federal courts, the buck stops with the third circuit. The third circuit currently has two judicial vacancies. The vacant seat that President nominated Judge Restrepo to fill has been declared a judicial emergency. That means it has a very heavy caseload. In fact the third circuit has more than 900 weighted filings per judgeship. Filling a vacancy on that important Federal appellate court will lower the caseload burden and ensure access to justice for more Americans. Judge Restrepo is a well-qualified individual. There is no question about that. He has over 10 years of experience on the Federal bench. In fact the Senate unanimously confirmed him to serve as a Federal district judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Prior to that, he served as a Federal magistrate judge. As a member of the Federal bench, he has presided over 56 trials that have gone to verdict or judgement. He has a wealth of experience in both public service and private practice. He was a founding member of a Philadelphia law firm, where he practiced both criminal defense and civil rights litigation. He served as an assistant Federal defender with the Community Federal Defender for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and an assistant defender for the Defender Association of Philadelphia. He has relevant experience in both criminal and civil law, which will serve him well as a Federal appellate judge. Judge Restrepo has excellent legal credentials. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania and his law degree from Tulane University Law School. The work of a Federal appellate judge can often be academic as the job requires a judge to address legal issues of first impression. Judge Restrepo has more than two decades of teaching experience at both the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Temple University James E. Beasley School of Law. He also taught with the National Institute for Trial Advocacy. In addition, he has written numerous articles appearing in a variety of national legal publications. He has dedicated his time to public service and to bettering his community. He is the former president of the Hispanic Bar Association of Pennsylvania. He served on the board of directors for the Defender Association of Philadelphia and the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Philadelphia and Susquehanna Valley. As a Federal judge, he has also participated in a reentry program to assist people recently released from federal custody to reenter the community and become productive citizens. I believe he has a wealth of relevant experience and a strong legal background. Other Senators share my confidence in Judge Restrepo. He has the bipartisan support from both Pennsylvania Senators and was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous voice vote. Judge Restrepo's confirmation is also historic. He will be the first Latino judge from Pennsylvania to serve on the third circuit and only the second Latino to sit on that court. He also has the strong endorsement of the Hispanic National Bar Association. According to that distinguished organization, Judge Restrepo's ``integrity, knowledge of the law, breadth of professional experience, and intellectual capacity make him well suited to sit as a federal appellate judge.'' I could not agree more. I urge my colleagues to confirm Judge Restrepo to the third circuit today. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be recognized as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be able [[Page S19]] to display on the Senate floor these two vials of liquid nicotine to tell what just passed. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tribute to officer jesse hartnett mr. president, i wish to briefly address one other item this evening before i yield the floor. i want to speak about the appalling shooting that occurred in philadelphia just last thursday evening when a shooter attempted to assassinate a police officer in the name of isis on the streets of philadelphia. the shooter wasn't counting on the amazing bravery of philadelphia police officer jesse hartnett. it was late, about 11:30 at night on thursday, and apparently a man waved down jesse hartnett as he was driving along in his police cruiser. officer hartnett stopped the cruiser. the man walked over as if to ask for directions, and instead, out of the blue, he started firing shots at pointblank range into the driver's side window at officer hartnett. he kept walking up to the car. as he walked, he kept shooting. at one point he actually had his arm, with the gun, inside the window of the car and was still shooting. in total, the shooter fired 13 shots. cameras that happened to be in that area captured the incident. it is absolutely amazing that officer hartnett managed to survive. it is amazing. but he didn't just survive. he jumped out of his patrol car. he had been hit three times and was very seriously injured. his arm was bleeding profusely. he got out of his car and chased down the shooter. he shot and wounded the would-be killer, and because of his heroic action while literally under fire, the shooter was apprehended. this is an amazing example of true grit, and the people of pennsylvania couldn't be more proud of officer hartnett. our prayers are certainly with officer hartnett and his family. he has a very difficult recovery ahead of him. he has already had one surgery. my understanding is that he has undergone a second surgery today, or is in the process of undergoing that surgery. the [[page s18]] doctors are trying to save his arm, which was badly injured. i want to be clear about this. what happened that thursday night was an act of terrorism. it was an act of terrorism inspired by violent islamic extremism. the shooter reportedly declared that he had pledged his allegiance to the islamic state. he said that he was targeting police officers because he believes that the police are defending and enforcing laws that are contrary to the koran, and the shooter himself said that he acted in the name of islam and the islamic state. we don't know for sure yet whether the shooter has direct personal ties to isis abroad, but the fbi has reported that the shooter traveled to saudi arabia in 2011 and then went to egypt for several months in 2012. regardless of what he was doing over there or what his purpose was, we should make no mistake; this was an act of terrorism just as the shootings at fort hood and san bernardino were. let me be abundantly clear. i think everyone obviously knows that this cop killer--this would-be cop killer--doesn't represent all muslims. no one would suggest that, but he does represent a terrible strain of violent islamic extremism, a strain that has amassed millions of dollars, has followers all around the planet, and is, in fact, at war with america. isis and the violent islamic extremists that are followers of isis pose a very serious threat to america. we have seen this repeatedly now, including in my home state of pennsylvania in the city of philadelphia. we are very fortunate. we have incredibly courageous law enforcement officers, such as officer hartnett, protecting us, but we shouldn't in any way diminish the magnitude and gravity of this threat. i commend officer jesse hartnett for his bravery. to officer hartnett and his family, please know that the people of pennsylvania are behind you, thinking of you, and praying for a full and speedy recovery. with that, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from pennsylvania. mr. casey. mr. president,

Therefore, if a child gets one of these bottles and it does not have the cap that they can't get off, we now know the experience from several poison centers across the country in the last couple of years.

We have had a couple of fatalities in this country. Therefore, it was common sense for us to require--and thankfully, the liquid nicotine industry went along and did not object--to make these childproof. But that will now be in the law. Let me point out something. This is aside from the question of whether you should be inhaling this stuff in an e- cigarette. I think people are finding out that this is becoming quite dangerous as well. But aside from that issue, this was the issue of protecting children. Look at this.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS19-2,CREC-2016-01-11,114,Trans-Pacific Partnership (Executive Session),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S19-S21] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Trans-Pacific Partnership Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I came from an informal hearing--not an official Senate hearing but a hearing downstairs called by Congressman Levin, who is the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. A number of other Members were there, including my colleague from Ohio, Representative Kaptur, and a number of people the Presiding Officer served with in the House--Congressmen Sarbanes, Rangel, Pascrell, Doggett, and Schiff. We discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I spoke earlier on this today. I know Senator McConnell has said that he will not bring it up this year, I think in large part because of the opposition from the country. Senator Lott, the Republican leader, a decade or so ago said that you can't pass a trade agreement in an even- numbered year. He was a strong supporter of these trade agreements. I believe he and most in his party supported NAFTA and CAFTA. He wasn't here for CAFTA but he was for some of those other trade agreements. But he said that because he knows that politicians want to vote for these trade agreements in large part because of corporate lobbying. But the public doesn't want us to vote for these trade agreements. My first year in Congress, I spent much of the year working in opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. I have seen a number of these: NAFTA, PNTR with China, CAFTA, the trade agreement with Korea, big promises about jobs, big claims about jobs, and exaggerated commitments about jobs. Every time we lose jobs from these trade agreements. Our trade deficit is up to a couple billion dollars a day now. But if you buy a billion dollars of products from another country rather than making them yourselves here, rather than American companies making them, we know that costs us jobs. When you think it is $2 billion--almost $2 billion every single day, well over a billion, but the numbers are not precise--in trade deficit, where we buy from other countries more than we export and sell to other countries, we know it is costing us jobs. One of the other things that came out of this discussion with a number of Ways and Means Committee members, small business, a former trade negotiator, and a union representative there was how we have seen increasingly companies in Little Rock, in Dayton or in Toledo shut down production here and move it overseas and then sell those products back into the United States. The auto industry has not done much of that. When the auto industry sets up in Asia and are manufacturing cars, they typically sell them in that part of the world. Unfortunately, GM just announced that they are going to be making an SUV plant in China and selling those products back into the United States. That is a terrible trend. The reason I stopped on the floor before the vote in a couple of minutes is to say this: The Trans-Pacific Partnership has set us up in way that will make that worse. Under NAFTA, Canada, the United States, and Mexico--I strongly oppose NAFTA. But under that trade agreement, products in automobiles--almost two-thirds of all of the components in an automobile--had to be made in one of these three countries in order to get the tariff benefits from NAFTA for those companies, those products. Now there are 12 countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fewer than half the components have to be made in one of these 12 countries. What does that mean? It means that more than half of an automobile can come from parts made in China but sold in the United States tariff- free under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. How can we possibly think that makes sense as a policy? That is fundamentally why the Trans- Pacific Partnership does not make sense for our country. It doesn't make sense for small businesses in Mansfield, OH, or in Springfield, OH, and it doesn't make sense for the up to 600,000 workers in my State--some 600,000 workers who are in the auto supply chain. We know a lot of them will lose jobs under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I yield the rest of my time to Senator Leahy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio. We are finally going to vote on the long overdue confirmation of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the third circuit in Pennsylvania. He was nominated way over a year ago--nearly 14 months ago--with strong bipartisan support from home State Senators. This is a case where, unfortunately, the Republican leadership has subjected Judge Restrepo to totally unnecessary delay as part of their wholesale obstruction of judicial nominees. Their actions hurt not only the people of Pennsylvania, but also Americans across the country as judicial vacancies have remained unfilled nationwide after Republicans took over the Senate majority last year. I hope that today's vote and the agreement to vote on four district court nominees this work period signals a return to the Senate fulfilling its constitutional duty of providing advice and consent on the President's nominees. In all of 2015, Senate Republicans allowed votes on only 11 judicial nominations. This matched the record for confirming the fewest number of judicial nominees in more than half a century. I mention that because Democrats took the majority in the last 2 years of President Bush's term. We confirmed 40 judges during that year-- [[Page S20]] 40. I was chairman. I remember that very well. I didn't want to repeat the things that we saw during the Clinton administration, where the Republicans came in and the then-Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee killed over 60 nominees of the Clinton administration by not allowing them to have a vote in committee. I said: Let's move faster. I moved 40 through. Did the Republicans do the same? No, they allowed 11. Republicans also left town at the end of last year with 19 judicial nominees still pending on the floor, including Judge Restrepo. Each of the nominees has the support of their home state Senators and their nominations were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. These are the kind of noncontroversial judicial nominees that the Senate has traditionally confirmed at the end of a session. During the Obama administration, however, Republicans have rejected this practice. Judge Restrepo exemplifies the kind of consensus nominee that should have been easily confirmed at the end of the session. He is nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which has two vacant judgeships in Pennsylvania. He has the strong bipartisan support of his home state Senators, Senator Casey and Senator Toomey. In fact, Senator Toomey has said he personally recommended Judge Restrepo to the President for the nomination. In 2013, this body confirmed Judge Restrepo's nomination to the Federal district court by voice vote. I have heard no objection from any Senator to Judge Restrepo's nomination. I cannot believe this man who will be the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania for the third circuit was humiliated by having to wait 14 months. This highly qualified Hispanic judge was told to go to the back of the line and wait 14 months. It is wrong. It is absolutely wrong. I will vote to confirm Judge Restrepo. Since 2013, he has served as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. For the seven years prior, he served as a Federal magistrate judge on the same court. Before joining the bench, Judge Restrepo was in private practice as a named partner at Krasner & Restrepo. He began his legal career serving as a public defender as an Assistant Defender for the Defender Association of Philadelphia before becoming an Assistant Federal Defender for the Federal Community Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on July 9, 2015. His nomination has the full support of the Hispanic National Bar Association. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the Hispanic National Bar Association's letter in support of Judge Restrepo at the conclusion of my remarks. Republicans' obstruction of highly qualified judicial nominees with strong support, like Judge Restrepo, has resulted in a sharp rise in judicial vacancies. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. After a year of Republicans neglecting judicial confirmations, vacancies have dramatically increased to 72--an increase of more than 60 percent. Furthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled under Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans took over last year to 33 today. In his annual year-end report, even Chief Justice Roberts drew our attention to the ``crushing dockets'' and heavy caseloads that strain the Federal judiciary and prevent Americans from obtaining timely justice in our courts. The high number of vacancies is entirely of the Senate Republican leadership's making, and Senate action is required to resolve it. The first step is to confirm the rest of the 18 judicial nominees pending right now on the floor. Under a bipartisan agreement reached at the end of last year, the Majority Leader will schedule confirmation votes on four district court nominees between now and the President's Day recess. After we vote on those nominees, we will still have nominees from Tennessee, Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, New York, and California pending on the floor, nearly all of whom would fill emergency vacancies. Votes on these nominees must be scheduled without further delay. Let's start facing up to fact that we have enormous problems with judiciary emergencies in States where both Republicans and Democrats have supported the nominees. Let them come forward. Let them be voted on. Let's stop making the Federal courts a political pawn. It is bad enough with all the political shenanigans going on in this country anyway in an election year. Don't do them with the Federal court system. We have the best, the most honest, the least partisan Federal court system anywhere in the world. But don't say: Oh, you are a highly qualified Hispanic nominee, but you just wait there for 14 months, be humiliated, and then we will finally allow a vote. I don't care whether someone is Hispanic or non-Hispanic; we have so many men and women who are highly qualified. In addition to the nominees pending on the floor, there are also four Pennsylvania district court nominees that the Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to report out this month. I sincerely hope the junior Senator from Pennsylvania can convince the Republican Majority Leader not to submit these additional Pennsylvania nominees to the extensive confirmation delay that Judge Restrepo endured. The people of Pennsylvania have waited long enough. I also understand that the White House has been working for months with Senator Toomey and Senator Casey on the second Pennsylvania vacancy on the third circuit. I look forward to the Judiciary Committee considering that nomination soon. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: March 31, 2015. Re Hispanic National Bar Association Endorsement of Nomination of The Honorable Luis Felipe Restrepo to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Hon. Chuck Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf of the Hispanic National Bar Association (``HNBA''), we write to recommend the confirmation of the Honorable Luis Felipe Restrepo to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. As explained below, we believe that Judge Restrepo has all the requisite qualifications to serve in this role and will serve the Court and the parties that come before it with distinction and integrity. The HNBA is a non-profit, non-partisan national membership association that represents the interests of Hispanic attorneys, judges, law professors, law students, and legal professionals in the United States and Puerto Rico. One of the HNBA's many institutional objectives is to advocate and work to ensure that the federal and state courts in our nation are diverse and reflect the citizenry that come before our courts daily. Judge Restrepo sought the HNBA's endorsement shortly after President Obama nominated him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The HNBA conducted a thorough due diligence process that included interviews of personal and professional references (including judges and attorneys), a review of his scholarly writings and legal opinions, and a thorough Internet search. We also have considered his background and qualifications in the context of the requirements of the position for which he was nominated, as well as the requirements of the HNBA's Policies and Procedures Governing Judicial Endorsements. After a careful review, it is clear that Judge Restrepo possesses the professional expertise, experience, personal integrity and judicial temperament to distinguish himself as a federal appellate judge. Accordingly, we urge you to confirm his nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Prior to being sworn in as a District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 2013 and his appointment as a Magistrate Judge in 2006, Judge Restrepo was a highly- regarded Philadelphia attorney and founding member of the firm of Krasner & Restrepo, concentrating on criminal defense and civil rights litigation. Before forming his law firm, he served as an assistant federal defender with the Community Federal Defender for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and an assistant defender for the Defender Association of Philadelphia. He is an adjunct professor at Temple University James E. Beasley School of Law, was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1997-2009 where he was appointed the Irving R. Segal Lecturer in advocacy, and has taught with the National Institute for Trial Advocacy in regional and national programs since 1991. He [[Page S21]] has been a lecturer at seminars sponsored by a number of agencies and organizations and has written numerous articles appearing in a variety of national publications. Throughout his career, Judge Restrepo has stood out as an exceptional role model for community involvement and civic participation. He has devoted his time and expertise to a variety of boards and commissions as well as the Eastern District prisoner reentry program. The HNBA's due diligence process has confirmed that Judge Restrepo's integrity, knowledge of the law, breadth of professional experience, and intellectual capacity make him well suited to sit as a federal appellate judge. Accordingly, it is with great pride that we have the privilege of endorsing the Honorable Luis Felipe Restrepo and recommend his confirmation to serve as a Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Please do not hesitate to contact us at the HNBA National Office at (202) 223-4777, or you may contact Cynthia D. Mares directly at (720) 314-1295 or by e-mail at president@hnba.com , if we can be of any further assistance. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Cynthia D. Mares, HNBA National President.

Mr. President, I came from an informal hearing--not an official Senate hearing but a hearing downstairs called by Congressman Levin, who is the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. A number of other Members were there, including my colleague from Ohio, Representative Kaptur, and a number of people the Presiding Officer served with in the House--Congressmen Sarbanes, Rangel, Pascrell, Doggett, and Schiff. We discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I spoke earlier on this today. I know Senator McConnell has said that he will not bring it up this year, I think in large part because of the opposition from the country. Senator Lott, the Republican leader, a decade or so ago said that you can't pass a trade agreement in an even- numbered year. He was a strong supporter of these trade agreements. I believe he and most in his party supported NAFTA and CAFTA. He wasn't here for CAFTA but he was for some of those other trade agreements. But he said that because he knows that politicians want to vote for these trade agreements in large part because of corporate lobbying. But the public doesn't want us to vote for these trade agreements. My first year in Congress, I spent much of the year working in opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. I have seen a number of these: NAFTA, PNTR with China, CAFTA, the trade agreement with Korea, big promises about jobs, big claims about jobs, and exaggerated commitments about jobs. Every time we lose jobs from these trade agreements. Our trade deficit is up to a couple billion dollars a day now. But if you buy a billion dollars of products from another country rather than making them yourselves here, rather than American companies making them, we know that costs us jobs. When you think it is $2 billion--almost $2 billion every single day, well over a billion, but the numbers are not precise--in trade deficit, where we buy from other countries more than we export and sell to other countries, we know it is costing us jobs. One of the other things that came out of this discussion with a number of Ways and Means Committee members, small business, a former trade negotiator, and a union representative there was how we have seen increasingly companies in Little Rock, in Dayton or in Toledo shut down production here and move it overseas and then sell those products back into the United States. The auto industry has not done much of that. When the auto industry sets up in Asia and are manufacturing cars, they typically sell them in that part of the world. Unfortunately, GM just announced that they are going to be making an SUV plant in China and selling those products back into the United States. That is a terrible trend. The reason I stopped on the floor before the vote in a couple of minutes is to say this: The Trans-Pacific Partnership has set us up in way that will make that worse. Under NAFTA, Canada, the United States, and Mexico--I strongly oppose NAFTA. But under that trade agreement, products in automobiles--almost two-thirds of all of the components in an automobile--had to be made in one of these three countries in order to get the tariff benefits from NAFTA for those companies, those products. Now there are 12 countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and fewer than half the components have to be made in one of these 12 countries. What does that mean? It means that more than half of an automobile can come from parts made in China but sold in the United States tariff- free under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. How can we possibly think that makes sense as a policy? That is fundamentally why the Trans- Pacific Partnership does not make sense for our country. It doesn't make sense for small businesses in Mansfield, OH, or in Springfield, OH, and it doesn't make sense for the up to 600,000 workers in my State--some 600,000 workers who are in the auto supply chain. We know a lot of them will lose jobs under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I yield the rest of my time to Senator Leahy. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio. We are finally going to vote on the long overdue confirmation of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the third circuit in Pennsylvania. He was nominated way over a year ago--nearly 14 months ago--with strong bipartisan support from home State Senators. This is a case where, unfortunately, the Republican leadership has subjected Judge Restrepo to totally unnecessary delay as part of their wholesale obstruction of judicial nominees. Their actions hurt not only the people of Pennsylvania, but also Americans across the country as judicial vacancies have remained unfilled nationwide after Republicans took over the Senate majority last year. I hope that today's vote and the agreement to vote on four district court nominees this work period signals a return to the Senate fulfilling its constitutional duty of providing advice and consent on the President's nominees. In all of 2015, Senate Republicans allowed votes on only 11 judicial nominations. This matched the record for confirming the fewest number of judicial nominees in more than half a century. I mention that because Democrats took the majority in the last 2 years of President Bush's term. We confirmed 40 judges during that year-- [[Page S20]] 40. I was chairman. I remember that very well. I didn't want to repeat the things that we saw during the Clinton administration, where the Republicans came in and the then-Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee killed over 60 nominees of the Clinton administration by not allowing them to have a vote in committee. I said: Let's move faster. I moved 40 through. Did the Republicans do the same? No, they allowed 11. Republicans also left town at the end of last year with 19 judicial nominees still pending on the floor, including Judge Restrepo. Each of the nominees has the support of their home state Senators and their nominations were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. These are the kind of noncontroversial judicial nominees that the Senate has traditionally confirmed at the end of a session. During the Obama administration, however, Republicans have rejected this practice. Judge Restrepo exemplifies the kind of consensus nominee that should have been easily confirmed at the end of the session. He is nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which has two vacant judgeships in Pennsylvania. He has the strong bipartisan support of his home state Senators, Senator Casey and Senator Toomey. In fact, Senator Toomey has said he personally recommended Judge Restrepo to the President for the nomination. In 2013, this body confirmed Judge Restrepo's nomination to the Federal district court by voice vote. I have heard no objection from any Senator to Judge Restrepo's nomination. I cannot believe this man who will be the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania for the third circuit was humiliated by having to wait 14 months. This highly qualified Hispanic judge was told to go to the back of the line and wait 14 months. It is wrong. It is absolutely wrong. I will vote to confirm Judge Restrepo. Since 2013, he has served as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. For the seven years prior, he served as a Federal magistrate judge on the same court.

He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on July 9, 2015. His nomination has the full support of the Hispanic National Bar Association. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the Hispanic National Bar Association's letter in support of Judge Restrepo at the conclusion of my remarks. Republicans' obstruction of highly qualified judicial nominees with strong support, like Judge Restrepo, has resulted in a sharp rise in judicial vacancies. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. After a year of Republicans neglecting judicial confirmations, vacancies have dramatically increased to 72--an increase of more than 60 percent. Furthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled under Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans took over last year to 33 today. In his annual year-end report, even Chief Justice Roberts drew our attention to the ``crushing dockets'' and heavy caseloads that strain the Federal judiciary and prevent Americans from obtaining timely justice in our courts. The high number of vacancies is entirely of the Senate Republican leadership's making, and Senate action is required to resolve it. The first step is to confirm the rest of the 18 judicial nominees pending right now on the floor. Under a bipartisan agreement reached at the end of last year, the Majority Leader will schedule confirmation votes on four district court nominees between now and the President's Day recess. After we vote on those nominees, we will still have nominees from Tennessee, Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, New York, and California pending on the floor, nearly all of whom would fill emergency vacancies. Votes on these nominees must be scheduled without further delay. Let's start facing up to fact that we have enormous problems with judiciary emergencies in States where both Republicans and Democrats have supported the nominees. Let them come forward. Let them be voted on. Let's stop making the Federal courts a political pawn. It is bad enough with all the political shenanigans going on in this country anyway in an election year. Don't do them with the Federal court system. We have the best, the most honest, the least partisan Federal court system anywhere in the world. But don't say: Oh, you are a highly qualified Hispanic nominee, but you just wait there for 14 months, be humiliated, and then we will finally allow a vote. I don't care whether someone is Hispanic or non-Hispanic; we have so many men and women who are highly qualified. In addition to the nominees pending on the floor, there are also four Pennsylvania district court nominees that the Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to report out this month. I sincerely hope the junior Senator from Pennsylvania can convince the Republican Majority Leader not to submit these additional Pennsylvania nominees to the extensive confirmation delay that Judge Restrepo endured. The people of Pennsylvania have waited long enough. I also understand that the White House has been working for months with Senator Toomey and Senator Casey on the second Pennsylvania vacancy on the third circuit. I look forward to the Judiciary Committee considering that nomination soon. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: March 31, 2015. Re Hispanic National Bar Association Endorsement of Nomination of The Honorable Luis Felipe Restrepo to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Hon. Chuck Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf of the Hispanic National Bar Association (``HNBA''), we write to recommend the confirmation of the Honorable Luis Felipe Restrepo to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. As explained below, we believe that Judge Restrepo has all the requisite qualifications to serve in this role and will serve the Court and the parties that come before it with distinction and integrity. The HNBA is a non-profit, non-partisan national membership association that represents the interests of Hispanic attorneys, judges, law professors, law students, and legal professionals in the United States and Puerto Rico. One of the HNBA's many institutional objectives is to advocate and work to ensure that the federal and state courts in our nation are diverse and reflect the citizenry that come before our courts daily. Judge Restrepo sought the HNBA's endorsement shortly after President Obama nominated him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The HNBA conducted a thorough due diligence process that included interviews of personal and professional references (including judges and attorneys), a review of his scholarly writings and legal opinions, and a thorough Internet search. We also have considered his background and qualifications in the context of the requirements of the position for which he was nominated, as well as the requirements of the HNBA's Policies and Procedures Governing Judicial Endorsements. After a careful review, it is clear that Judge Restrepo possesses the professional expertise, experience, personal integrity and judicial temperament to distinguish himself as a federal appellate judge. Accordingly, we urge you to confirm his nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Prior to being sworn in as a District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 2013 and his appointment as a Magistrate Judge in 2006, Judge Restrepo was a highly- regarded Philadelphia attorney and founding member of the firm of Krasner & Restrepo, concentrating on criminal defense and civil rights litigation. Before forming his law firm, he served as an assistant federal defender with the Community Federal Defender for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and an assistant defender for the Defender Association of Philadelphia. He is an adjunct professor at Temple University James E. Beasley School of Law, was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1997-2009 where he was appointed the Irving R. Segal Lecturer in advocacy, and has taught with the National Institute for Trial Advocacy in regional and national programs since 1991. He [[Page S21]] has been a lecturer at seminars sponsored by a number of agencies and organizations and has written numerous articles appearing in a variety of national publications. Throughout his career, Judge Restrepo has stood out as an exceptional role model for community involvement and civic participation. He has devoted his time and expertise to a variety of boards and commissions as well as the Eastern District prisoner reentry program. The HNBA's due diligence process has confirmed that Judge Restrepo's integrity, knowledge of the law, breadth of professional experience, and intellectual capacity make him well suited to sit as a federal appellate judge. Accordingly, it is with great pride that we have the privilege of endorsing the Honorable Luis Felipe Restrepo and recommend his confirmation to serve as a Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Please do not hesitate to contact us at the HNBA National Office at (202) 223-4777, or you may contact Cynthia D. Mares directly at (720) 314-1295 or by e-mail at president@hnba.com , if we can be of any further assistance. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Cynthia D. Mares, HNBA National President.

through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] trans-pacific partnership mr. brown. mr. president, i came from an informal hearing--not an official senate hearing but a hearing downstairs called by congressman levin, who is the senior democrat on the ways and means committee. a number of other members were there, including my colleague from ohio, representative kaptur, and a number of people the presiding officer served with in the house--congressmen sarbanes, rangel, pascrell, doggett, and schiff. we discussed the trans-pacific partnership. i spoke earlier on this today. i know senator mcconnell has said that he will not bring it up this year, i think in large part because of the opposition from the country. senator lott, the republican leader, a decade or so ago said that you can't pass a trade agreement in an even- numbered year. he was a strong supporter of these trade agreements. i believe he and most in his party supported nafta and cafta. he wasn't here for cafta but he was for some of those other trade agreements. but he said that because he knows that politicians want to vote for these trade agreements in large part because of corporate lobbying. but the public doesn't want us to vote for these trade agreements. my first year in congress, i spent much of the year working in opposition to the north american free trade agreement. i have seen a number of these: nafta, pntr with china, cafta, the trade agreement with korea, big promises about jobs, big claims about jobs, and exaggerated commitments about jobs. every time we lose jobs from these trade agreements. our trade deficit is up to a couple billion dollars a day now. but if you buy a billion dollars of products from another country rather than making them yourselves here, rather than american companies making them, we know that costs us jobs. when you think it is $2 billion--almost $2 billion every single day, well over a billion, but the numbers are not precise--in trade deficit, where we buy from other countries more than we export and sell to other countries, we know it is costing us jobs. one of the other things that came out of this discussion with a number of ways and means committee members, small business, a former trade negotiator, and a union representative there was how we have seen increasingly companies in little rock, in dayton or in toledo shut down production here and move it overseas and then sell those products back into the united states. the auto industry has not done much of that. when the auto industry sets up in asia and are manufacturing cars, they typically sell them in that part of the world. unfortunately, gm just announced that they are going to be making an suv plant in china and selling those products back into the united states. that is a terrible trend. the reason i stopped on the floor before the vote in a couple of minutes is to say this: the trans-pacific partnership has set us up in way that will make that worse. under nafta, canada, the united states, and mexico--i strongly oppose nafta. but under that trade agreement, products in automobiles--almost two-thirds of all of the components in an automobile--had to be made in one of these three countries in order to get the tariff benefits from nafta for those companies, those products. now there are 12 countries in the trans-pacific partnership and fewer than half the components have to be made in one of these 12 countries. what does that mean? it means that more than half of an automobile can come from parts made in china but sold in the united states tariff- free under the trans-pacific partnership. how can we possibly think that makes sense as a policy? that is fundamentally why the trans- pacific partnership does not make sense for our country. it doesn't make sense for small businesses in mansfield, oh, or in springfield, oh, and it doesn't make sense for the up to 600,000 workers in my state--some 600,000 workers who are in the auto supply chain. we know a lot of them will lose jobs under the trans-pacific partnership. i yield the rest of my time to senator leahy. the presiding officer. the senator from vermont. mr. leahy. mr. president, i thank the distinguished senator from ohio. we are finally going to vote on the long overdue confirmation of judge luis felipe restrepo to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit in pennsylvania. he was nominated way over a year ago--nearly 14 months ago--with strong bipartisan support from home state senators. this is a case where, unfortunately, the republican leadership has subjected judge restrepo to totally unnecessary delay as part of their wholesale obstruction of judicial nominees. their actions hurt not only the people of pennsylvania, but also americans across the country as judicial vacancies have remained unfilled nationwide after republicans took over the senate majority last year. i hope that today's vote and the agreement to vote on four district court nominees this work period signals a return to the senate fulfilling its constitutional duty of providing advice and consent on the president's nominees. in all of 2015, senate republicans allowed votes on only 11 judicial nominations. this matched the record for confirming the fewest number of judicial nominees in more than half a century. i mention that because democrats took the majority in the last 2 years of president bush's term. we confirmed 40 judges during that year-- [[page s20]] 40. i was chairman. i remember that very well. i didn't want to repeat the things that we saw during the clinton administration, where the republicans came in and the then-republican chairman of the senate judiciary committee killed over 60 nominees of the clinton administration by not allowing them to have a vote in committee. i said: let's move faster. i moved 40 through. did the republicans do the same? no, they allowed 11. republicans also left town at the end of last year with 19 judicial nominees still pending on the floor, including judge restrepo. each of the nominees has the support of their home state senators and their nominations were reported out of the judiciary committee by voice vote. these are the kind of noncontroversial judicial nominees that the senate has traditionally confirmed at the end of a session. during the obama administration, however, republicans have rejected this practice. judge restrepo exemplifies the kind of consensus nominee that should have been easily confirmed at the end of the session. he is nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the third circuit court of appeals, which has two vacant judgeships in pennsylvania. he has the strong bipartisan support of his home state senators, senator casey and senator toomey. in fact, senator toomey has said he personally recommended judge restrepo to the president for the nomination. in 2013, this body confirmed judge restrepo's nomination to the federal district court by voice vote. i have heard no objection from any senator to judge restrepo's nomination. i cannot believe this man who will be the first hispanic judge from pennsylvania for the third circuit was humiliated by having to wait 14 months. this highly qualified hispanic judge was told to go to the back of the line and wait 14 months. it is wrong. it is absolutely wrong. i will vote to confirm judge restrepo. since 2013, he has served as a judge on the u.s. district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania. for the seven years prior, he served as a federal magistrate judge on the same court. before joining the bench, judge restrepo was in private practice as a named partner at krasner & restrepo. he began his legal career serving as a public defender as an assistant defender for the defender association of philadelphia before becoming an assistant federal defender for the federal community defender office for the eastern district of pennsylvania. he was voted out of the judiciary committee by unanimous voice vote on july 9, 2015. his nomination has the full support of the hispanic national bar association. i ask unanimous consent to have printed

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS21-3,CREC-2016-01-11,114,CLIMATE CHANGE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S21-S22] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Happy new year. Nothing says ``Happy new year'' like the ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, so I will kick off 2016 with my year- opener ``Time to Wake Up'' speech recapping some of last year's climate change milestones. They say you only get one chance to make a first impression, and the first impression Senate Republicans chose to make in 2015 was to use their first 3 weeks of floor time--3 full weeks of precious floor time--to help a foreign oil company's tar sands pipeline. Even though it meant the government condemning American farms, even though the President was sure to veto it, that was their opener. By the end of the year, things had changed. The Republican leader was burying the votes against the Clean Power Plan deep in the news of the terrible Paris massacres and collapsing votes together to minimize floor time on this issue. The Republican majority opened 2015 with a big oil bang but crept out of the year with a whimper. Things indeed changed in 2015. Of course, the scientific evidence continued to show that fossil fuel pollution was damaging our environment and our oceans and our economy. And 2015 was record-setting hot. This chart from November shows that 2015 is on track to being the hottest year globally since we began keeping records in 1880. We can see that the 2015 running monthly global temperature average is above the 6 next warmest years on record in every month for which data is available. The Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates the probability of 2015 being the hottest on record at better than 99 percent. He has labeled 2015 a ``scorcher.'' But that won't be official until later this month. It is no fluke. The World Meteorological Organization reports the recent 5-year period--2011 to 2015--as the warmest 5-year period on record, and 2015 was the first year where monthly global average carbon dioxide concentrations exceeded 400 parts per million, and it did so for more than 3 months. Bear in mind that for as long as human beings have been on this planet Earth, we have existed safely in a range of 170 to 300 parts per million. We are outside of that by almost the entire range, and we know this from ice cores which contain tiny bubbles of ancient atmospheres. I saw those ice cores last October at Ohio State University. World-renowned atmospheric scientists, the husband-and-wife team Dr. Ellen Mosley Thompson and Dr. Lonnie Thompson, worked for years to retrieve cores from around the world and to test the ancient air captured inside. The lesson of these cores is that humans have fundamentally altered the chemistry of the Earth's air and that our greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly altering our climate. Scientists now say that we have so altered the Earth as to consider ourselves in a new geologic epoch, the Anthropocene. In 2015, the oceans kept shouting at us to wake up. Throughout 2015, evidence continued to document our oceans warming, rising, and acidifying. And 2015 brought the first nationwide study assessing the vulnerability of America's $1 billion shellfish industry to ocean acidification, documenting the risk to 15 coastal States, such as Louisiana, Texas, Maine, and Rhode Island. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October reported on climate change's threats to fish integral to human diets, predicting a dramatic collapse in the world's largest ecosystem, our oceans. The great corrupt denial machine the fossil fuel industry supports never talks about oceans. The machine doesn't care about evidence; it is just an obstacle to their fossil fuel PR campaign. They just want to create phony doubt. But since there is not much room for doubt [[Page S22]] in measurements of warming, rising, and acidifying seas, they won't go there. Nevertheless, 2015 was another bad year for oceans. Mr. President, 2015 was also the year journalists, academics, and investigators took a hard look at that big, phony climate denial apparatus. The year 2015 brought reports that Exxon knew climate change was real but funded the climate denial apparatus anyway, reports of how fossil fuel money influenced the front groups' language, and reports about hidden money and networks of influence and fossil fuel money controlling politics. Report after report showed fossil fuel money pouring into dozens of front groups, creating phony doubt and controversy, then propagated through media outlets also in the tank to the fossil fuel industry, such as FOX News and the Wall Street Journal editorial page. If you doubt that climate change is real, you have been had. It is really that simple. It is a racket. And 2015 was the year when many voices began asking for a racketeering investigation into a fraud of historic proportions. Mr. President, 2015 was a year of growing public recognition across America of the need to act. A 2015 Stanford poll found that 83 percent of Americans, including 6 in 10 Republicans, want action to reduce carbon emissions. For the first time, a majority of self-identified Republicans now believe there is solid evidence of global warming. And if you take out the loopy Tea Party cohort, among sensible Republicans, the number goes even higher. Among young Republican voters--Republican voters under age 35--most said they would describe a climate denier as ``ignorant,'' ``out of touch,'' or ``crazy.'' In 2015, the EPA launched the Clean Power Plan, our Nation's most ambitious effort yet. It is the first-ever plan to reduce carbon pollution from the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions: powerplants. The Clean Power Plan is projected to both cut carbon emissions and save Americans money on their annual energy bills. In 2015, the Obama administration at last rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline--a great victory for the environmental movement after the 400,000-person climate march in New York City. In 2015, Pope Francis-- the world leader of the Catholic Church--added his holy voice to the call. ``Humanity,'' Pope Francis said, ``is called . . . to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it.'' Specifically, the Pope said, ``[T]echnology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels, needs to be progressively replaced without delay.'' Pope Francis's encyclical said something to Congress: To take up these responsibilities, and the costs they entail, politicians will inevitably clash with the mindset of short-term gain and results which dominates present-day economics and politics. But if they are courageous, they will attest to their God-given dignity and leave behind a testimony of selfless responsibility. And 2015 showed some signs of political courage, dignity, and responsibility. Republican Congressman Bob Inglis took a beating at the hands of the fossil fuel industry, but he did not give up the fight. Our colleague Lindsey Graham ran for the Republican nomination on a sensible climate change platform. He and other Senate colleagues have started a little Senate Republican study group. Twelve House Republicans, led by Congressman Chris Gibson of New York, broke with their party's Orthodoxy and sponsored a resolution committing to address climate change by promoting ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism. It is not much yet, but it is a start. It is a turn. Perhaps the biggest milestone of 2015 was the Paris agreement reached in December, with 190 countries agreeing to a global deal to address climate change. One key element was that more than 150 major U.S. companies signed on to the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, calling for strong outcomes in the Paris climate negotiations. These companies' operations together span all 50 States, they employ nearly 11 million people, they represent more than $4.2 trillion in annual revenue, and they have a combined market capitalization of over $7 trillion. These are blue-chip American icons such as AT&T of Texas, Coca-Cola and UPS of Georgia, Procter & Gamble of Ohio, and Walmart of Arkansas. How long can Republicans ignore them? You know the phrase about lipstick on a pig? Well, 2015 brought so much change that even the big fossil fuel pigs felt they had to try on a little lipstick. Typical of them, it was bogus--just enough happy talk about climate change and carbon fees to get the CEOs through a Davos cocktail party without being shunned, while here in Congress, their whole brutal political apparatus, up to and including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--which these days should probably be called the U.S. Chamber of Carbon--kept relentlessly hammering against any prospect of meaningful climate legislation. Real or not, it is noteworthy that the big oil tycoons at least felt the need for some lipstick. Speaking of piggy, 2015 was also the year the International Monetary Fund calculated the effective public subsidy of the fossil fuel industry at $700 billion per year just in the United States alone. Remember when the costs of carbon pollution are not factored into the price, those costs become a public subsidy--a market failure. This subsidy climbs into the trillions of dollars worldwide. If that is not piggy, nothing is. My biggest prayer for 2016 is the American business coalition from Paris helping Republican colleagues acknowledge publicly what many have concluded privately; that it is time for Congress to address climate change. If Republicans can get some relief from the brutal political pressure of the fossil fuel industry, there are conservative-friendly solutions at hand. Every Republican who has thought this problem through to a solution comes to the same place, every one. Former Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State George Shultz, President Reagan's economic adviser Art Laffer, President George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and his Council of Economic Advisers Chair Greg Mankiw, former Congressman Bob Inglis, and many others, all advocated last year that a carbon fee is the efficient way to correct the market failure that lets the fossil fuel industry pollute for free. Four former Republican EPA Administrators, Bill Ruckelshaus, Christine Todd Whitman, Lee Thomas, and Bill Reilly, wrote: ``A market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.'' Even a columnist at the Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page is notoriously fossil fuel friendly, wrote: ``There's no dispute among economists on the most cost-effective way to [reduce emissions]: a carbon tax.'' Well, we have one. In 2015, the conservative American Enterprise Institute hosted the announcement of my legislation with Senator Schatz, creating a revenue-neutral carbon fee, with none--zero--of the revenues kept by the Federal Government but instead being used to provide massive corporate tax reductions and personal tax rebates. We have gone to exactly where Republicans are pointing. So please, colleagues, take yes for an answer. Join us, and let's get to work. Mr. President, 2015 was a year the tide turned in Congress, from that opening Keystone Pipeline political fanfare to the buried, quiet, end- of-the-year votes on the President's Clean Power Plan, with three Republicans even voting to support President Obama on those votes. It was a turning year and a new year now begins. We still need to wake up. We still need to get to work. We still have a duty before us, and it is a duty we should not shirk. I pray that 2016 will be the year, and I promise to do everything in my power to make it the year. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S21-S22] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Happy new year. Nothing says ``Happy new year'' like the ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, so I will kick off 2016 with my year- opener ``Time to Wake Up'' speech recapping some of last year's climate change milestones. They say you only get one chance to make a first impression, and the first impression Senate Republicans chose to make in 2015 was to use their first 3 weeks of floor time--3 full weeks of precious floor time--to help a foreign oil company's tar sands pipeline. Even though it meant the government condemning American farms, even though the President was sure to veto it, that was their opener. By the end of the year, things had changed. The Republican leader was burying the votes against the Clean Power Plan deep in the news of the terrible Paris massacres and collapsing votes together to minimize floor time on this issue. The Republican majority opened 2015 with a big oil bang but crept out of the year with a whimper. Things indeed changed in 2015. Of course, the scientific evidence continued to show that fossil fuel pollution was damaging our environment and our oceans and our economy. And 2015 was record-setting hot. This chart from November shows that 2015 is on track to being the hottest year globally since we began keeping records in 1880. We can see that the 2015 running monthly global temperature average is above the 6 next warmest years on record in every month for which data is available. The Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates the probability of 2015 being the hottest on record at better than 99 percent. He has labeled 2015 a ``scorcher.'' But that won't be official until later this month. It is no fluke. The World Meteorological Organization reports the recent 5-year period--2011 to 2015--as the warmest 5-year period on record, and 2015 was the first year where monthly global average carbon dioxide concentrations exceeded 400 parts per million, and it did so for more than 3 months. Bear in mind that for as long as human beings have been on this planet Earth, we have existed safely in a range of 170 to 300 parts per million. We are outside of that by almost the entire range, and we know this from ice cores which contain tiny bubbles of ancient atmospheres. I saw those ice cores last October at Ohio State University. World-renowned atmospheric scientists, the husband-and-wife team Dr. Ellen Mosley Thompson and Dr. Lonnie Thompson, worked for years to retrieve cores from around the world and to test the ancient air captured inside. The lesson of these cores is that humans have fundamentally altered the chemistry of the Earth's air and that our greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly altering our climate. Scientists now say that we have so altered the Earth as to consider ourselves in a new geologic epoch, the Anthropocene. In 2015, the oceans kept shouting at us to wake up. Throughout 2015, evidence continued to document our oceans warming, rising, and acidifying. And 2015 brought the first nationwide study assessing the vulnerability of America's $1 billion shellfish industry to ocean acidification, documenting the risk to 15 coastal States, such as Louisiana, Texas, Maine, and Rhode Island. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October reported on climate change's threats to fish integral to human diets, predicting a dramatic collapse in the world's largest ecosystem, our oceans. The great corrupt denial machine the fossil fuel industry supports never talks about oceans. The machine doesn't care about evidence; it is just an obstacle to their fossil fuel PR campaign. They just want to create phony doubt. But since there is not much room for doubt [[Page S22]] in measurements of warming, rising, and acidifying seas, they won't go there. Nevertheless, 2015 was another bad year for oceans. Mr. President, 2015 was also the year journalists, academics, and investigators took a hard look at that big, phony climate denial apparatus. The year 2015 brought reports that Exxon knew climate change was real but funded the climate denial apparatus anyway, reports of how fossil fuel money influenced the front groups' language, and reports about hidden money and networks of influence and fossil fuel money controlling politics. Report after report showed fossil fuel money pouring into dozens of front groups, creating phony doubt and controversy, then propagated through media outlets also in the tank to the fossil fuel industry, such as FOX News and the Wall Street Journal editorial page. If you doubt that climate change is real, you have been had. It is really that simple. It is a racket. And 2015 was the year when many voices began asking for a racketeering investigation into a fraud of historic proportions. Mr. President, 2015 was a year of growing public recognition across America of the need to act. A 2015 Stanford poll found that 83 percent of Americans, including 6 in 10 Republicans, want action to reduce carbon emissions. For the first time, a majority of self-identified Republicans now believe there is solid evidence of global warming. And if you take out the loopy Tea Party cohort, among sensible Republicans, the number goes even higher. Among young Republican voters--Republican voters under age 35--most said they would describe a climate denier as ``ignorant,'' ``out of touch,'' or ``crazy.'' In 2015, the EPA launched the Clean Power Plan, our Nation's most ambitious effort yet. It is the first-ever plan to reduce carbon pollution from the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions: powerplants. The Clean Power Plan is projected to both cut carbon emissions and save Americans money on their annual energy bills. In 2015, the Obama administration at last rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline--a great victory for the environmental movement after the 400,000-person climate march in New York City. In 2015, Pope Francis-- the world leader of the Catholic Church--added his holy voice to the call. ``Humanity,'' Pope Francis said, ``is called . . . to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it.'' Specifically, the Pope said, ``[T]echnology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels, needs to be progressively replaced without delay.'' Pope Francis's encyclical said something to Congress: To take up these responsibilities, and the costs they entail, politicians will inevitably clash with the mindset of short-term gain and results which dominates present-day economics and politics. But if they are courageous, they will attest to their God-given dignity and leave behind a testimony of selfless responsibility. And 2015 showed some signs of political courage, dignity, and responsibility. Republican Congressman Bob Inglis took a beating at the hands of the fossil fuel industry, but he did not give up the fight. Our colleague Lindsey Graham ran for the Republican nomination on a sensible climate change platform. He and other Senate colleagues have started a little Senate Republican study group. Twelve House Republicans, led by Congressman Chris Gibson of New York, broke with their party's Orthodoxy and sponsored a resolution committing to address climate change by promoting ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism. It is not much yet, but it is a start. It is a turn. Perhaps the biggest milestone of 2015 was the Paris agreement reached in December, with 190 countries agreeing to a global deal to address climate change. One key element was that more than 150 major U.S. companies signed on to the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, calling for strong outcomes in the Paris climate negotiations.

selfless responsibility. and 2015 showed some signs of political courage, dignity, and responsibility. republican congressman bob inglis took a beating at the hands of the fossil fuel industry, but he did not give up the fight. our colleague lindsey graham ran for the republican nomination on a sensible climate change platform. he and other senate colleagues have started a little senate republican study group. twelve house republicans, led by congressman chris gibson of new york, broke with their party's orthodoxy and sponsored a resolution committing to address climate change by promoting ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism. it is not much yet, but it is a start. it is a turn. perhaps the biggest milestone of 2015 was the paris agreement reached in december, with 190 countries agreeing to a global deal to address climate change. one key element was that more than 150 major u.s. companies signed on to the american business act on climate pledge, calling for strong outcomes in the paris climate negotiations. these companies' operations together span all 50 states, they employ nearly 11 million people, they represent more than $4.2 trillion in annual revenue, and they have a combined market capitalization of over $7 trillion. these are blue-chip american icons such as at&t of texas, coca-cola and ups of georgia, procter & gamble of ohio, and walmart of arkansas. how long can republicans ignore them? you know the phrase about lipstick on a pig? well, 2015 brought so much change that even the big fossil fuel pigs felt they had to try on a little lipstick. typical of them, it was bogus--just enough happy talk about climate change and carbon fees to get the ceos through a davos cocktail party without being shunned, while here in congress, their whole brutal political apparatus, up to and including the u.s. chamber of commerce--which these days should probably be called the u.s. chamber of carbon--kept relentlessly hammering against any prospect of meaningful climate legislation. real or not, it is noteworthy that the big oil tycoons at least felt the need for some lipstick. speaking of piggy, 2015 was also the year the international monetary fund calculated the effective public subsidy of the fossil fuel industry at $700 billion per year just in the united states alone. remember when the costs of carbon pollution are not factored into the price, those costs become a public subsidy--a market failure. this subsidy climbs into the trillions of dollars worldwide. if that is not piggy, nothing is. my biggest prayer for 2016 is the american business coalition from paris helping republican colleagues acknowledge publicly what many have concluded privately; that it is time for congress to address climate change. if republicans can get some relief from the brutal political pressure of the fossil fuel industry, there are conservative-friendly solutions at hand. every republican who has thought this problem through to a solution comes to the same place, every one. former treasury secretary and secretary of state george shultz, president reagan's economic adviser art laffer, president george w. bush's treasury secretary hank paulson, and his council of economic advisers chair greg mankiw, former congressman bob inglis, and many others, all advocated last year that a carbon fee is the efficient way to correct the market failure that lets the fossil fuel industry pollute for free. four former republican epa administrators, bill ruckelshaus, christine todd whitman, lee thomas, and bill reilly, wrote: ``a market-based approach, like a carbon tax, would be the best path to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.'' even a columnist at the wall street journal, whose editorial page is notoriously fossil fuel friendly, wrote: ``there's no dispute among economists on the most cost-effective way to [reduce emissions]: a carbon tax.'' well, we have one. in 2015, the conservative american enterprise institute hosted the announcement of my legislation with senator schatz, creating a revenue-neutral carbon fee, with none--zero--of the revenues kept by the federal government but instead being used to provide massive corporate tax reductions and personal tax rebates. we have gone to exactly where republicans are pointing. so please, colleagues, take yes for an answer. join us, and let's get to work. mr. president, 2015 was a year the tide turned in congress, from that opening keystone pipeline political fanfare to the buried, quiet, end- of-the-year votes on the president's clean power plan, with three republicans even voting to support president obama on those votes. it was a turning year and a new year now begins. we still need to wake up. we still need to get to work. we still have a duty before us, and it is a duty we should not shirk. i pray that 2016 will be the year, and i promise to do everything in my power to make it the year. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",12059

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgS22,CREC-2016-01-11,114,BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S22-S25] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for January 2016. The report compares current law levels [[Page S23]] of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. This is the first scorekeeping report for this calendar year but the fifth report I have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the Congressional Record on December 2, 2015. The information contained in this report is current through January 5, 2016. Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee is below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. Over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period, which is the entire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate authorizing committees have spent $148 billion more than the budget resolution calls for. Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On December 18, 2015, the President signed H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, P.L. 114-113, into law. This bill provided regular appropriations equal to the levels set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74, specifically $548.1 billion in budget authority for defense accounts, revised security category, and $518.5 billion in budget authority for nondefense accounts, revised nonsecurity category. Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. This separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 of S. Con. Res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. The consolidated appropriations bill included $73.7 billion in budget authority and $32.1 billion in outlays for OCO/GWOT in fiscal year 2016. This level is equal to the revised OCO/GWOT levels that I filed in the Record on December 18, 2015. The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for overall CHIMPS and the crime victims fund CHIMP, respectively. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 and section 3104, respectively. Enacted CHIMPS are under both the broader CHIMPS limit, $1.3 billion less, and the crime victims fund limit, $1.8 billion less. In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I will use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress. For fiscal year 2016, CBO estimates that current law levels are $138.9 billion and $103.6 billion above the budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $155.2 billion below the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 million below assumed levels for the budget year. CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently shows deficit reduction of $20.5 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 period and $95.6 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. Over the initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would increase revenues by $17 billion and decrease outlays by $3.5 billion. Over the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would increase revenues by $36.7 billion and decrease outlays by $58.9 billion. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS (In millions of dollars) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 2016-2020 2016-2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Armed Services Budget Authority............. -66 -518 -1,117 Outlays...................... -50 -476 -1,099 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Commerce, Science, and Transportatioin Budget Authority............. 130 650 1,300 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Energy and Natural Resources Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Environment and Public Works Budget Authority............. 2,880 19,432 9,459 Outlays...................... 252 1,147 -8,801 Finance Budget Authority............. 345 41,005 152,913 Outlays...................... 345 41,005 152,913 Foreign Relations Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Homeland Security and Government Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 -1 0 Judiciary Budget Authority............. -3,358 5,962 4,833 Outlays...................... 1,713 5,862 4,082 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Budget Authority............. 0 208 278 Outlays...................... 0 208 278 Rules and Administration Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Intelligence Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Veterans' Affairs Budget Authority............. -2 -1 -1 Outlays...................... 388 644 644 Indian Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Small Business Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 1 2 2 -------------------------------------- Total Budget Authority......... -71 66,738 167,665 Outlays.................. 2,649 48,391 148,019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY APPROPRIATIONS \1\ (Budget authority, in millions of dollars) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 --------------------------------- Security \2\ Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........ 548,091 518,491 Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Agriculture, Rural Development, and 0 21,750 Related Agencies.....................

Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for January 2016. The report compares current law levels [[Page S23]] of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. This is the first scorekeeping report for this calendar year but the fifth report I have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the Congressional Record on December 2, 2015. The information contained in this report is current through January 5, 2016. Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee is below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. Over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period, which is the entire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate authorizing committees have spent $148 billion more than the budget resolution calls for. Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On December 18, 2015, the President signed H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, P.L. 114-113, into law. This bill provided regular appropriations equal to the levels set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74, specifically $548.1 billion in budget authority for defense accounts, revised security category, and $518.5 billion in budget authority for nondefense accounts, revised nonsecurity category. Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. This separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 of S. Con. Res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. The consolidated appropriations bill included $73.7 billion in budget authority and $32.1 billion in outlays for OCO/GWOT in fiscal year 2016. This level is equal to the revised OCO/GWOT levels that I filed in the Record on December 18, 2015. The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for overall CHIMPS and the crime victims fund CHIMP, respectively. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 and section 3104, respectively. Enacted CHIMPS are under both the broader CHIMPS limit, $1.3 billion less, and the crime victims fund limit, $1.8 billion less. In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I will use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress. For fiscal year 2016, CBO estimates that current law levels are $138.9 billion and $103.6 billion above the budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $155.2 billion below the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 million below assumed levels for the budget year. CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently shows deficit reduction of $20.5 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 period and $95.6 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. Over the initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would increase revenues by $17 billion and decrease outlays by $3.5 billion. Over the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would increase revenues by $36.7 billion and decrease outlays by $58.9 billion. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS (In millions of dollars) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 2016-2020 2016-2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Armed Services Budget Authority............. -66 -518 -1,117 Outlays...................... -50 -476 -1,099 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Commerce, Science, and Transportatioin Budget Authority............. 130 650 1,300 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Energy and Natural Resources Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Environment and Public Works Budget Authority............. 2,880 19,432 9,459 Outlays...................... 252 1,147 -8,801 Finance Budget Authority............. 345 41,005 152,913 Outlays...................... 345 41,005 152,913 Foreign Relations Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Homeland Security and Government Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 -1 0 Judiciary Budget Authority............. -3,358 5,962 4,833 Outlays...................... 1,713 5,862 4,082 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Budget Authority............. 0 208 278 Outlays...................... 0 208 278 Rules and Administration Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Intelligence Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Veterans' Affairs Budget Authority............. -2 -1 -1 Outlays...................... 388 644 644 Indian Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Small Business Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 1 2 2 -------------------------------------- Total Budget Authority......... -71 66,738 167,665 Outlays.................. 2,649 48,391 148,019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY APPROPRIATIONS \1\ (Budget authority, in millions of dollars) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 --------------------------------- Security \2\ Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........ 548,091 518,491 Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Agriculture, Rural Development, and 0 21,750 Related Agencies.....................

Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for January 2016. The report compares current law levels [[Page S23]] of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. This is the first scorekeeping report for this calendar year but the fifth report I have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the Congressional Record on December 2, 2015. The information contained in this report is current through January 5, 2016. Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee is below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. Over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period, which is the entire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate authorizing committees have spent $148 billion more than the budget resolution calls for. Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On December 18, 2015, the President signed H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, P.L. 114-113, into law. This bill provided regular appropriations equal to the levels set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114-74, specifically $548.1 billion in budget authority for defense accounts, revised security category, and $518.5 billion in budget authority for nondefense accounts, revised nonsecurity category. Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. This separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 of S. Con. Res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. The consolidated appropriations bill included $73.7 billion in budget authority and $32.1 billion in outlays for OCO/GWOT in fiscal year 2016. This level is equal to the revised OCO/GWOT levels that I filed in the Record on December 18, 2015. The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, CHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for overall CHIMPS and the crime victims fund CHIMP, respectively. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 and section 3104, respectively. Enacted CHIMPS are under both the broader CHIMPS limit, $1.3 billion less, and the crime victims fund limit, $1.8 billion less. In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I will use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress. For fiscal year 2016, CBO estimates that current law levels are $138.9 billion and $103.6 billion above the budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $155.2 billion below the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 million below assumed levels for the budget year. CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently shows deficit reduction of $20.5 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 period and $95.6 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. Over the initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would increase revenues by $17 billion and decrease outlays by $3.5 billion. Over the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would increase revenues by $36.7 billion and decrease outlays by $58.9 billion. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS (In millions of dollars) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 2016-2020 2016-2025 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Armed Services Budget Authority............. -66 -518 -1,117 Outlays...................... -50 -476 -1,099 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Commerce, Science, and Transportatioin Budget Authority............. 130 650 1,300 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Energy and Natural Resources Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Environment and Public Works Budget Authority............. 2,880 19,432 9,459 Outlays...................... 252 1,147 -8,801 Finance Budget Authority............. 345 41,005 152,913 Outlays...................... 345 41,005 152,913 Foreign Relations Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Homeland Security and Government Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 -1 0 Judiciary Budget Authority............. -3,358 5,962 4,833 Outlays...................... 1,713 5,862 4,082 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Budget Authority............. 0 208 278 Outlays...................... 0 208 278 Rules and Administration Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Intelligence Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Veterans' Affairs Budget Authority............. -2 -1 -1 Outlays...................... 388 644 644 Indian Affairs Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 0 0 0 Small Business Budget Authority............. 0 0 0 Outlays...................... 1 2 2 -------------------------------------- Total Budget Authority......... -71 66,738 167,665 Outlays.................. 2,649 48,391 148,019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY APPROPRIATIONS \1\ (Budget authority, in millions of dollars) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2016 --------------------------------- Security \2\ Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........ 548,091 518,491 Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Agriculture, Rural Development, and 0 21,750 Related Agencies.....................

____________________",package_114_238.csv,27862,27862,27930,"[congressional record volume 162, number 6 (monday, january 11, 2016)] [senate] [pages s22-s25] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] budget scorekeeping report mr. enzi. mr. president, i wish to submit to the senate the budget scorekeeping report for january 2016. the report compares current law levels [[page s23]] of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the conference report to accompany s. con. res. 11, the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016. this information is necessary to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. it has been prepared by the republican staff of the senate budget committee and the congressional budget office, cbo, pursuant to section 308(b) of the congressional budget act, cba. this is the first scorekeeping report for this calendar year but the fifth report i have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution on may 5, 2015. my last filing can be found in the congressional record on december 2, 2015. the information contained in this report is current through january 5, 2016. table 1 gives the amount by which each senate authorizing committee is below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. this information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the cba. over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period, which is the entire period covered by s. con. res. 11, senate authorizing committees have spent $148 billion more than the budget resolution calls for. table 2 gives the amount by which the senate committee on appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. this information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the cba. on december 18, 2015, the president signed h.r. 2029, the consolidated appropriations act, 2016, p.l. 114-113, into law. this bill provided regular appropriations equal to the levels set in the bipartisan budget act of 2015, p.l. 114-74, specifically $548.1 billion in budget authority for defense accounts, revised security category, and $518.5 billion in budget authority for nondefense accounts, revised nonsecurity category. table 3 gives the amount by which the senate committee on appropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism, oco/gwot, spending. this separate allocation for oco/gwot was established in section 3102 of s. con. res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the cba. the consolidated appropriations bill included $73.7 billion in budget authority and $32.1 billion in outlays for oco/gwot in fiscal year 2016. this level is equal to the revised oco/gwot levels that i filed in the record on december 18, 2015. the budget resolution established two new points of order limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, chimps. tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for overall chimps and the crime victims fund chimp, respectively. this information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 and section 3104, respectively. enacted chimps are under both the broader chimps limit, $1.3 billion less, and the crime victims fund limit, $1.8 billion less. in addition to the tables provided by the senate budget committee republican staff, i am submitting additional tables from cbo that i will use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the congress. for fiscal year 2016, cbo estimates that current law levels are $138.9 billion and $103.6 billion above the budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively. revenues are $155.2 billion below the level assumed in the budget resolution. finally, social security outlays are at the levels assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, while social security revenues are $23 million below assumed levels for the budget year. cbo's report also provides information needed to enforce the senate's pay-as-you-go rule. the senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently shows deficit reduction of $20.5 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 period and $95.6 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. over the initial 6-year period, congress has enacted legislation that would increase revenues by $17 billion and decrease outlays by $3.5 billion. over the 11-year period, congress has enacted legislation that would increase revenues by $36.7 billion and decrease outlays by $58.9 billion. the senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of s. con. res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. all years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. i ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: table 1.--senate authorizing

LEMM Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today to the life of TSgt Joseph G. Lemm who was killed while serving his country in Afghanistan. It was his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. Joe was born in Dubuque, IA, and lived in the nearby town of Bernard as a young child. He was a police officer in New York City and served in the New York Air National Guard. Clearly, his was a life of public service, defending his fellow Americans both at home and abroad. His willingness to repeatedly put himself in harm's way speaks volumes about his courage and character. I am told that he was often called Superman, and like Superman, Joe spent his life defending ``Truth, Justice, and the American Way.'' He will be remembered for his extraordinary love of country and family. My prayers go out to his wife, Christine; his daughter, Brooke; his son, Ryan; as well as his mother, Shirley, and his father, Charles. Their premature loss will leave an enormous hole in their lives, but they can be very proud of the life Joe lived. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S25] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING TECHNICAL SERGEANT JOSEPH G.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 100th Pennsylvania Farm Show, which is being held this week in Harrisburg, PA. Established in 1917, the Pennsylvania Farm Show is held every January and showcases the Commonwealth's vibrant farming traditions and finest foods. With 24 acres of exhibition space, it is the Nation's largest indoor agricultural event. This year's show will display more than 13,000 exhibits and is anticipated to draw half a million visitors from across the Nation. The farm show always provides free admission and allows everyone the chance to learn more about Pennsylvania agriculture. It hosts a wide variety of events and displays including livestock exhibits, art displays, and educational workshops. In addition to its hands-on exhibits, the farm show allows visitors to sample products that are grown and produced in Pennsylvania. Farmers display their fruits and vegetables while vendors sell local favorites, including pretzels, apple butter, and shoofly pie. As the occupant of the Senate candy desk, I would be remiss not to recognize the small, family-owned candy companies that also sell their products at the farm show. With a nod toward education, the Pennsylvania Farm Show sponsors the scholarship foundation for students pursuing their post-secondary education in the agriculture field. Since its creation, the foundation has donated over $1 million in scholarships to youth involved in 4-H, Future Farmers of America, and other agriculture organizations. It is encouraging to see such a strong commitment to agriculture's continued success in Pennsylvania for the foreseeable future. This weekend, my family and I will attend the 2016 Pennsylvania Farm Show. Farming is a vital component to Pennsylvania's economy, and I am proud of our State's dairy, livestock, and agriculture products. I look forward to the farm show every year, and I encourage all Pennsylvanians to attend this event to experience firsthand our State's rich agriculture history. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S26] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 100TH PENNSYLVANIA FARM SHOW Mr. TOOMEY.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the efforts of RADM Joan Hunter during her tenure as the Assistant Joint Surgeon at the National Guard Bureau, Joint Surgeon General's Office, Psychological Health, NGB, JSG-PH. In this capacity, RADM Hunter has served as principal staff and adviser to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. As a member of the Joint Surgeon's Office, RADM Hunter partnered with the J1, Manpower and Personnel Directorate, and the J32, the Counterdrug Division, to direct services to address the psychological health needs of Guard members and their families. Her most significant contribution was building the National Guard's psychological health program, which meant placing a director of psychological health in every State, wing, and territory based on the Department [[Page S26]] of Defense's Mental Health Task Force Report recommendations. As a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service, RADM Hunter is a shining example of how the whole government can come together to address mental health issues in our military. I have had the honor and pleasure of working closely with RADM Hunter during her time at NGB, and I am grateful for her leadership, energy, and innovation. Mental health is a critical readiness issue for all our servicemembers, and the Department of Defense has made important progress in improving the mental health and resilience of our force. Unfortunately, in the past, the unique needs and challenges faced by our Guard members and Reservists were often neglected by programs designed to serve the Active component. Under RADM Hunter's direction, that is changing. She has made a real, tangible impact on the lives of Guard members, and in doing so, she has done a tremendous service to our Nation and our communities. RADM Hunter is a champion in the fight to combat military suicide, improve mental health and resiliency among our servicemembers, and field the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. She has been an especially valued partner in this undertaking, and while she will be sorely missed at NGB, I know she will continue to do great things for our country. I wish RADM Hunter the best of luck in her new assignment and thank her for her dedicated service to our men and women in the National Guard. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S25-S26] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL JOAN HUNTER Mr. DONNELLY.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lee, NH, a town in Strafford County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its founding. I am proud to join citizens across New Hampshire in recognizing this special milestone. Lee was originally settled in 1657 and was officially incorporated in 1766 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. In the century leading up to its incorporation, Lee was part of Durham and the Oyster River Plantation. Lee was also one of the last towns to be incorporated by Governor Wentworth. Wadleigh Falls, located in Lee, is a historic landmark and one of the oldest areas in New Hampshire to be inhabited by humans. Abenaki and Penacook tribes would come to the falls for hunting, fishing, and farming as far back as 8,000 years ago. Upon settlement, the Europeans would follow in the Native Americans' footsteps and use the falls to their economic advantage. The settlers started using this site in 1657, and the first mill was built in 1665. Mills in Lee processed timber, grain, leather, wooden buckets, and herbal medicines. Generous clay deposits and the town's lumber mill system allowed Lee to become a valued location for industry in the early history of the United States. The town's agricultural tradition has also been very important to Lee and its many farms that are still operating today. In addition to its agricultural advantages, Lee is also known for its unique landscape features including scenic plains, meadows, winding streams, brooks, and Wheelwright Pond, named after Reverend John Wheelwright. Today Lee's students and families enjoy an exceptional education system, thanks in large part to a tradition of learning and knowledge that has long been ingrained in the community. The Oyster River Cooperative School District is consistently regarded as one of the top school districts in the State of New Hampshire. The town's population has grown from 1,029 residents in 1790 to over 4,300 in 2013. The people of Lee have a strong commitment to the spirit of community and volunteerism as evidenced by the hard work and dedication of residents involved with the planning of many events to celebrate the town's 250th anniversary. Lee and its residents have greatly contributed to the life and growth of New Hampshire. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending congratulations to the people of Lee as they celebrate the town's 250th anniversary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S26] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ RECOGNIZING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF LEE, NH Ms. AYOTTE.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I wish to honor my friend, former Wyoming Governor Mike Sullivan, who is being recognized as the 2016 National Western Stock Show's Citizen of the West. It is fitting that Mike was chosen for this special award. He joins a long line of honorees known for their values, ingenuity, and hard work. Mike, a cowboy in every sense of the word, carries these traits and many more in his heart and soul. Mike grew up in the prairie lands of Douglas, WY. His formative years were spent riding horses, shooting coffee cans, and enjoying the vast opportunities for recreation around the area. This appreciation led to a lifelong love of the State and her people. He was enamored with one Wyoming native in particular. Mike met Jane Metzler, who was born in Riverton and raised in Powell, during their studies at the University of Wyoming. Both of them were involved in social clubs and organizations. They even served together in the Associated Students of the University of Wyoming Student Senate. In 1961, the sweethearts were married. As they put down roots in Casper, they never lost sight of the important values that guide the people of our great State. Wyoming is the first State to adopt an official code of ethics, which we proudly call our Cowboy Ethics. This list of 10 principles serves as a guide for the modern cowboy and represents the distinct values that the American West is famous for. One of the tenets, ``Take pride in your work,'' brings to mind Mike and his incredible work ethic. With a petroleum engineering degree and a law degree, both earned at the University of Wyoming, Mike set his sights on practicing law. Well-loved and respected by many in the State, he ran--and was elected--to be Wyoming's 29th Governor in 1986. During his two terms, he governed the way he practiced law, with common sense and general decency. His leadership was crucial as at that time the State was experiencing one of [[Page S27]] its most economically trying periods. Falling oil and gas prices provided an opportunity for him to reach across the aisle and work with Democrats and Republicans alike to develop solutions to benefit the State and her residents. He is well known for his bipartisanship, which has brought lasting change and has resulted in a better quality of life for everyone living in the West. His political career did not end after serving as Governor. In 1999, President Bill Clinton appointed him to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He graciously accepted the position, and he and Jane moved to Dublin. His service as Ambassador surpassed all expectations of success. Mike was instrumental in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in the United Kingdom. With his special brand of warmth, humility, and integrity, Mike dutifully served both the United States and the world in this important role. Another of the principles listed in the Cowboy Ethics code is ``Ride for the brand.'' Upon meeting him, it is immediately apparent that Mike lives and breathes the spirit of the West. He has an intimate knowledge of the issues facing western States today, including the challenges of balancing energy development with natural resource preservation. He is a natural leader, and his passion for the State has served him well in many other important roles. During his tenure as Governor, he was the chairman of the Western Governors' Association, as well as the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, which focuses on the responsible, environmentally sound development of America's oil and gas resources. He has won numerous awards in honor of his service and commitment to giving back, including a Distinguished Service Medal from the Wyoming National Guard, an award of merit from the Wyoming Heritage Society, and the President's Award from the Wyoming State Bar. Despite these grand honors, Mike remains humble, choosing to spend time with his wife and family while enhancing his community and State. He certainly does ride for the brand. Mike's accomplishments are numerous, and for every one of them, his beloved wife, Jane Metzler Sullivan, has been by his side. As a third generation Wyoming native, Jane possesses an incredible value system reflective of the State's moral compass. Every bit a presence as her husband, Jane prides herself on making contributions to her community and State. She once said, ``Communities give us the opportunity to make our lives meaningful.'' The couple has been married for 54 years. Today, they enjoy the company of their three children and their spouses: Michelle Sullivan and Bryan Kuehl, Patrick and Ming Sullivan, and Theresa and JR Twiford. They adore their seven grandchildren: Patrick, Maggie, Caitie, Caitlyn, Michael, Jack, and Julia. I am confident that both Mike and Jane delight in sharing the best parts of their souls with their loving family. Mike has been gifted with bright ideas and a subtle sense of humor. He is jovial and kind and remains deeply active in the community of Casper. Folks who know him love him. He is a seasoned diplomat, a generous patron, and a passionate advocate for Wyoming. He champions Wyoming's cowboy spirit, and his mission to preserve and share the legacy of the American West with others is truly outstanding. I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating this incredible man as he is named the 2016 Citizen of the West. We simply could not ask for a better leader, role model, or friend. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S26-S27] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING MIKE SULLIVAN Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I wish to honor my friend, former Wyoming Governor Mike Sullivan, who is being recognized as the 2016 National Western Stock Show's Citizen of the West. It is fitting that Mike was chosen for this special award. He joins a long line of honorees known for their values, ingenuity, and hard work.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the veterans of Honor Flight Northern Colorado and the organization's 15th trip to Washington, DC. This group includes veterans from various wars and generations, but all are linked by their service to our country. Ten years ago, the Honor Flight was created to fly veterans that had served in World War II to Washington, DC so they could visit the World War II memorial. Now, the Honor Flight welcomes veterans from across the country to fly to Washington, DC, free of charge, to visit the memorials of the wars these heroic veterans fought. Currently, there are more than 21.8 million veterans living in the United States, and this growing population is continuously deserving of recognition. No matter the conflict, these veterans made exceptional sacrifices in order to serve and defend our country. Of the 123 veterans on the most recent Honor Flight, 13 served in World War II, 43 served in Korea, and 67 served in Vietnam. Please join me in honoring Paul Bechthold, Floyd Cooper, Raymond Ernest, Charles Hoelscher, Joseph Isley, Carl Johnson, Frederick Kaehler, Rex McFadden, Allan Meenen, William Ramsey, Donald Stephens, John Ulvang, Ceylon Weller, Robert Ault, Adolfo Benavides, Henry Bjorklund, Edwin Bowker, Albert Cain, Kenneth Creamer, Robert Crouch, Gerald Donnelly, Robert Eckhardt, Gary Eyre, William Ferguson, Elmer Fortin, Glen Geilenkirchen, James Gribben, Kent Grimsley, Walter Harris, Warren Hawkins, Carl Heufel, Eugene Hitchman, Neil Hoffman, Frank Hummel, Harold Jochum, Eldon Johnson, Roy Johnson, Michael Kennedy, Jimmie Kramer, Burman Lorenson, Robert McCauley, Gerald Meis, Robert Plick, Donald Reininger, Earl Reynolds, William Richardson, Royal Ryser, Merle Sapp, Raymond Schmitz, Ralph Sherman, Ned Steel, Vernon Sterkel, Richard Vandewalker, Richard Weinmeister, Donald Wiseman, Paul Zimmerman, Walter Amack, Ernest Anderson, Bruce Avery, Allen Brink, Wayne Burris, Gary Cain, James Christopher, Richard Cobb, Harold Colaizzi, Harold Collins, William Deivert, Russell Emmons, Michael Ferrell, Osia Fox, Robert Goodwin, Jerald Gossel, Josef Gruenwald, David Hallahan, Charles Ham, Calvin Hamilton Jr., Arnold Hart, Leland Haskell, Charles Hixon, Michael Jacomet, Dale Jenkins, Doyle Jenkins, Jimmie Johnston, Patrick Kistler, Edward Lobb, Danny Lynn, Thomas Marlo, Manuel Martinez, John McCarthy, Edward Meikel, Marilyn Miyaima, Royce Modisette, Stephen Mulvihill, Charles Munroe, Rueben Olivas Jr., Edward Olson, Ralph Otte, Stephen [[Page S28]] Pangrac, Jerry Park, Linda Plick, Thomas Pusel, Phillip Rangel, William Rhodes, John Robley, Rodney Rodriguez, Christopher Romero, Reuben Sanchez, Kenneth Sheppard, Wayne Shortridge, Walter Silva, Dennis Sindelir, James Spears, Thomas Steinbach, Robert Stolz, David Stout, Raymond Stroot, Floyd Taladay, Dennis Teter, Larry Uhlenkott, Robert Wheeler, Everett Winkler, William Vick, Merle Wood. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S27-S28] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONOR FLIGHT NORTHERN COLORADO Mr. GARDNER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the life and legacy of civil rights activist Ozell Sutton. A native of Gould, AR, Sutton paved the way for desegregation in the Natural State and throughout the South alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other civil rights leaders. After graduating from Dubar High School in Little Rock, Sutton studied at Philander Smith College where he earned a degree in political science. He broke barriers as the Arkansas Democrat's first Black journalist. In 2012, he shared the story of his hiring, saying that he didn't know anything about journalism but was hired because the Democrat ``wanted to reach the black community.'' He worked at the newspaper for 7 years where he made a difference in how the newspaper covered the African-American community. He challenged the status quo, inspiring change in the news stories to refer to Black men and women as ``Mr.'' and ``Mrs.,'' just as it did with the White population. Sutton was an activist serving as a decoy at Central High School in 1957 when the Little Rock Nine integrated the school. He recalled being beaten after the mob figured out he was a decoy. He led integration efforts in Arkansas while serving as assistant director of the Arkansas Council on Human Relations from 1961 to 1966 and joined civil rights leaders to pave the way for equality across the country. He joined the historic march on Washington and marched for voting rights in Selma. Following the death of Dr. King, he served Governor Winthrop Rockefeller as the director of the Governor's Council on Human Resources from 1968-1970 and continued his public service with the U.S. Department of Justice Community Relations Services. In 1972 he was appointed the director in the southeast region. He held that position until his retirement in 2003. As a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, Sutton served as regional vice president of the southwest region and southern region before going on to serve as the 26th general president. In 2012, Sutton was presented a Congressional Gold Medal as one of the first African Americans to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. Ozell Sutton dedicated his life to bettering the lives of future generations. He was a true American hero whose leadership helped fight desegregation and lay the foundation for equality. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family during this difficult time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S27] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING OZELL SUTTON Mr. BOOZMAN.

Res. 23 is a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5 of the United States Code of a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relating to ``Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units.'' This resolution would nullify EPA's carbon pollution standards for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants. Accordingly, I am withholding my approval of this resolution. (The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655 (1929)). Climate change poses a profound threat to our future and future generations. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse gas, are higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years. In 2009, EPA determined that greenhouse gas pollution endangers Americans' health and welfare by causing long-lasting changes in the climate that can have, and are already having, a range of negative effects on human health, the climate, and the environment. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, and established science confirms that we will experience stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons, and other intensified impacts as the planet warms. The Pentagon has determined that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. Power plants are the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in our country. Although we have limits on other dangerous pollutants from power plants, the carbon pollution standards and the Clean Power Plan ensure that we will finally have national standards to reduce the amount of carbon pollution that our power plants can emit. The carbon pollution standards will ensure that, when we make major investments in power generation infrastructure, we also deploy available technologies to make that infrastructure as low-emitting as possible. By blocking these standards from taking effect, S.J. Res. 23 would delay our transition to cleaner electricity generating technologies by enabling continued build-out of outdated, high- polluting infrastructure. Because it would overturn carbon pollution standards that are critical to protecting against climate change and ensuring the health and well-being of our Nation, I cannot support the resolution. To leave no doubt that the resolution is being vetoed, in addition to withholding my signature, I am returning S.J. Res. 23 to the Secretary of the Senate, along with this Memorandum of Disapproval.

Res. 24 is a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5 of the United States Code of a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relating to ``Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units.'' This resolution would nullify the Clean Power Plan, the first national standards to address climate- destabilizing greenhouse gas pollution from existing power plants. Accordingly, I am withholding my approval of this resolution. (The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655 (1929)). Climate change poses a profound threat to our future and future generations. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse gas, are higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years. In 2009, EPA determined that greenhouse gas pollution endangers Americans' health and welfare by causing long-lasting changes in the climate that can have, and are already having, a range of negative effects on human health, the climate, and the environment. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, and established science confirms that we will experience stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons, and other intensified impacts as the planet warms. The Pentagon has determined that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. The Clean Power Plan is a tremendously important step in the fight against global climate change. It is projected to reduce carbon pollution from power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It builds on progress States and the power sector are already making to move toward cleaner [[Page S29]] energy production, and gives States the time and flexibility they need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions. By nullifying the Clean Power Plan, S.J. Res. 24 not only threatens ongoing progress toward cleaner energy, but would also eliminate public health and other benefits of up to $54 billion per year by 2030, including thousands fewer premature deaths from air pollution and thousands fewer childhood asthma attacks each year. The Clean Power Plan is essential in addressing the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in our country. It is past time to act to mitigate climate impacts on American communities. Because the resolution would overturn the Clean Power Plan, which is critical to protecting against climate change and ensuring the health and well- being of our Nation, I cannot support it. To leave no doubt that the resolution is being vetoed, in addition to withholding my signature, I am returning S.J. Res. 24 to the Secretary of the Senate, along with this Memorandum of Disapproval.

HAKEEM S. JEFFRIES of new york in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Beraca Community Development Corporation (BCDC). In 2010, BCDC's mission to rebuild, repair and restore the lives of the disadvantaged led them to Haiti after the tragic 7.0 magnitude earthquake. On January 10, 2016, this year's awardees were honored at Beraca Baptist Church in Brooklyn, NY, for their invaluable service. BCDC opened offices in the towns of Leogane, Cabaret, Jeremie and Cape, Haiti where BCDC volunteer efforts are wide-reaching.

SUZANNE WRIGHT ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, last April I had the privilege of joining with Autism Speaks to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) marking World Autism Awareness Day. World Autism Awareness Day is an opportunity to highlight the progress we have made to better understand Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and assist impacted families, but to also raise awareness of the significant challenges that remain--both in the U.S. and abroad. World Autism Awareness Day is one of only seven U.N.-sanctioned `world days.' For eight years in a row, major landmarks, organizations and everyday Americans ``light it up blue,'' to raise awareness and bring additional resources to assist families impacted by autism. This year's events are scheduled for Saturday, April 2nd. The light it up blue campaign was launched by Autism Speaks co- founder and board member, Suzanne Wright--a tenacious, dedicated and committed leader whose contributions have made, and continue to make, a real and tangible difference in the lives of individuals with ASD and their families. By way of background, in 2005 Suzanne and Bob Wright co-founded Autism Speaks after their grandson Christian was diagnosed with autism. Every day since, for over a decade now, Suzanne has led through her work at the organization and through personal examples of generosity and compassion. As the Co-chair of the Congressional Coalition for Autism Research and Education and Chairman of the House Subcommittee that oversees global health, I have worked with Suzanne and Bob Wright to craft, and shepherd into law, legislation that will boost research, services and support for individuals with ASD, including the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2014 (Autism CARES/Public Law 113-157) and the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act (PL 112-32). I recently learned that Suzanne Wright has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and is taking a leave of absence from her work with Autism Speaks to manage her medical care. While there are many talented professionals who will carry the torch during Suzanne's leave and build on Suzanne's legacy at Autism Speaks, there will be a gaping hole only she can fill. I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in keeping Suzanne, her husband Bob, and the entire Wright family in our thoughts and prayers during these difficult days. And in Suzanne's honor, I call on all of us to redouble our efforts and work even harder to ensure that we do everything within our power to assist families touched by autism. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E27] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MRS.

Fred was born on January 15, 1942. In 1959, Fred graduated from Kailua High School, Oahu, where, in his senior year, he was a mile track record holder in Hawaii. This feat earned him a scholarship to the University of Michigan where he worked diligently to earn a master's degree in social work in 1971. After graduation, Fred began his career as an engineer in Lincoln, Nebraska. However, he switched his focus to public policy and social work, which he pursued in Illinois and Colorado. Throughout an accomplished career, Fred held many titles and positions. During his time in Illinois, he was the Chief of the Welfare Division, Illinois Institute for Social Policy and Assistant Director for Welfare and Manpower Programs, Illinois Bureau of the Budget. In 1975, after moving to Colorado, Fred became the Executive Administrator/Deputy Director of the Colorado Department of Social Services. Three years later, he served as the State Planning Director, Office of State Planning and Budgeting, for the State of Colorado. From 1978 to 1996, Fred served as the Executive Vice President/Chief Operating Officer at National Jewish Hospital. In 2000, after a distinguished career, Fred retired as the President of the Privatization Partnerships Division for Policy Studies. [[Page E28]] In addition to these tremendous professional accomplishments, Fred was a family man and pursued many activities outside of the office. He enjoyed biking, hiking, running, photography, reading, art, music, traveling and spending time with his family, friends and many pets. Fred and his wife of 35 years, Rita Barreras, had two children, Michael Victor Langille (Shelly George) and Heather Marie Coffey and have a grandson, Dylan Michael Langille. On August 6, 2015, Fred passed away in his home after a brave fight against prostate and bladder cancer. He was 73.

GORDON SNYDER FOR BEING NAMED THE 2015 NATIONAL MUSIC EDUCATOR OF THE YEAR ______ HON. RICHARD HUDSON of north carolina in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Gordon Snyder for being named by Music and Arts the 2015 National Music Educator of the Year. Music and Arts is a national retail chain dedicated to providing musicians with the instruments and products they need to enhance their musical talents. Mr. Snyder currently serves as Director of Instrumental Music at A.L. Brown High School, located in Kannapolis, North Carolina. He was nominated for the award by fellow educators, and had several students write letters of recommendation on his behalf This is a testament to the respect Mr. Snyder has earned from both his peers and his students, and I am extremely grateful for his commitment to ensuring our community's students receive a high-quality education. Although the National Music Educator of the Year award has been given for several years by Music and Arts, Mr. Snyder is the first recipient from the state of North Carolina. This is a particularly impressive accomplishment, as this year nearly 2,000 educators were nominated for this award.

CHARLES B. RANGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life, legacy, and the work of our esteemed former colleague, Congressman Lester Lionel Wolff, who is an exceptional father, husband, lawmaker, war hero and dear friend to many of us. Lester is not only an inspiration to future political leaders and public servants, but also an embodiment of diligence, persistence and success. It is well known to those who know Lester that he will never stop working to make our country better. Lester, who has recently turned 97, is still working hard as chairman of the International Trade and Development Agency and The International Information Agency and frequently travels to Washington, DC from New York City to visit congressional offices. Lester was born on January 4, 1919 and is a life-long New Yorker. Married to the late Blanche Silver, he has two loving children, Bruce, a prominent Washington lawyer, and Diane, an Adjunct Professor at the State University. He has four grandchildren and six great- grandchildren. Elected to the United States Congress in 1964, Lester served 16 years before retiring. It was an honor enough to work with him on a number of bills throughout the years. His service as Chairman of Foreign Policy Planning, Chairman of Asian Pacific Affairs, Chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control and Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Middle East subcommittee will not be forgotten. One of his notable bills was the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, which restored the initiative for direct peace talks between Israel and the Arab States. He also led the congressional delegation to meet with Deng Xiaoping, Father of Modern China. The Deng-Wolff conversation was credited by the Department of State for its particular importance in the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States. He is the author of the Taiwan Relations Act signed into law on April 10, 1979. This landmark law has undoubtedly helped the United States maintain and enhance its ties with Taiwan for more than three decades. Thanks to Lester, Taiwan is the United States' 10th largest trading partner, and the United States is Taiwan's largest foreign investor. Anyone who works with Lester is well aware of his prudence and expertise in foreign policy. Despite his retirement, he and I went on a trip to Taiwan to speak to government officials on U.S.-Taiwan relations and attend the Democratic Pacific Assembly--The Common Future of the Pacific in the 21st Century. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring Lester Wolff--the man who keeps on inspiring us with his wisdom and long-serving dedication to strengthening our country. I am pleased to see the fruits of his labor in Congress and as a public servant. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E28] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING LESTER WOLFF'S 97TH BIRTHDAY ______ HON.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgE28-4,CREC-2016-01-11,114,SENSELESS CHRISTMASTIME KILLINGS BY BOKO HARAM AND THE NEED FOR THE WORLD'S RECOMMITMENT TO RECOVERING THE CHIBOK GIRLS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E28-E29] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SENSELESS CHRISTMASTIME KILLINGS BY BOKO HARAM AND THE NEED FOR THE WORLD'S RECOMMITMENT TO RECOVERING THE CHIBOK GIRLS ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, over the Christmas 2015 break, 50 people were murdered and 114 others wounded in the northeastern Nigerian cities of Maiduguri and Madagali, Borno State, which is the birthplace of Boko Haram. Today also marks 633 days since 276 Chibok girls were kidnapped from their dormitories in the middle of night. Violence on the citizens of the world in sacred places such as our homes, places of worship, educational institutions and recreational venues is unacceptable and detestable. To keep the Chibok girls on our minds, all of us here in Congress have worn red every Wednesday to signal the urgency of rescuing, recovering and reintegrating these young women back into the arms of their parents. Sadly, while we grapple with the sore of the kidnapping of the Chibok girls, with horror, we watched on the news, violence wreaked by Boko Haram during the holidays. As we all know, Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for the massacres. I have met with the Nigerian President and was part of a delegation to Nigeria to engage local leaders, activists, businesses and families of victims of Boko Haram on strategies for recovering and reintegrating the Chibok girls and many others who have been kidnapped or suffered violence. These senseless killings and kidnappings by Boko Haram must stop. The Chibok girls are not throwaways and the world cannot and should not forget them. Those who lost their lives during the Christmastime massacres have families and loved ones whose hearts have been broken because of the pain and anguish they must now feel. We must continue to press on in our concerted efforts to assure victims that Boko Haram will be combatted and assure our Chibok daughters that we still care and that we are committed to bringing them back home and will work to protect them and reintegrate them back into our community with open arms. As founder and Co-Chair of the Caucus on Nigeria and Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, the rescue, return and reintegration of the kidnapped Chibok girls continue to be my top priority. I believe that with our commitment, just as the Aboke girls were recovered after being kidnapped in Northern Uganda by the Lord's Resistance Army, the Chibok girls will be rescued, returned home and reintegrated back into the human family. I am committed to the protection of the Nigerian people and it is my view that the people of Nigeria and others in the Lake Chad Basin in Africa should be afforded the protection they deserve and the opportunity to live their lives free of terrorism and fear. This is why I introduced H. Res. 528, legislation that enjoyed bipartisan support of my [[Page E29]] colleagues including Representatives Chu of California, Lee of California, Dold of Illinois, Hahn of California, Kelly of Illinois, Fudge of Ohio, Watson-Coleman of New Jersey, Sewell of Alabama, Brown of Florida, Thompson of Mississippi and my good friend Ms. Wilson of Florida. My resolution seeks to create a Victims of Terror Protection Fund for the protection of the Chibok girls when they return home as well as provision of much needed support for them and other displaced refugees, migrants and the victims of Boko Haram's terror such as those of the Christmastime 2015 massacres. All persons of the world from Syria to Nigeria to Colombia and everywhere in between possess the inalienable fundamental human right to freedom of movement and full realization of their human potential without fear of violence upon their person. Last month, in our celebrations of the United Nations Human Rights Day, the global community rededicated itself to the key International Covenants on Human Rights: the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Covenants that serve as the bedrock of the International Bill of Rights: protecting the right of all human beings. Indeed, we must continue to fight for the freedoms of our neighbors whether those for whom we fight are out of sight such as the murdered and wounded in northeastern Nigeria or the kidnapped Chibok teenage girls or educated medical doctors fleeing violent extremism in Syria. The bottom line is that our obligations in the human family must revolve around and be grounded in our conviction and commitment to the rights to freedom of movement, freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and the freedom from fear or terrorism, among others. We must remain steadfast in guaranteeing these fundamental freedoms and protect the human rights of all to achieve peace and prosperity in our world. Mr. Speaker, those murdered and wounded during the Christmastime massacres included a lot of youth. When they were kidnapped, the Chibok youth were 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds who are now turning 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18--living out the formative years of their lives in captivity in the claws of thugs. Our silence is a waste of time and this is why we must keep speaking, keep tweeting, keep seeking to recover our daughters and denouncing the atrocious actions of Boko Haram. This cannot be the fate or the end of the story of the lives of the victims of Boko Haram. We must not and cannot forget Blessing Abana, Deborah Abari, Rebecca Mallum, Naomi Luka, Esther Markus, Zara Ishaku, Ruth Joshua, Grace Paul, Rebecca Luka and the others. To the families of the Christmastime massacre, you are in our thoughts and prayers. To the Chibok girls, notwithstanding your captivity, let me assure you that your spirits, souls and bodies are sacred to us, no matter what attacks the enemies of peace may have perpetrated upon you. Like your sister from Pakistan, Malala, who was shot in the head for seeking her education and who continues to fight for your recovery, your best days are ahead because we know that when your girls thrive our world thrives. So let me assure you that you remain in our prayers and thoughts. To President Buhari of Nigeria, you have our support and you have my support in all your efforts to destroy and dismantle Boko Haram. To the people of Nigeria, we are counting on you to keep holding on, keep your faith strong and be assured that you are on the right side of history and that the arc of the moral universe always tips on the right side of justice. Today, let me offer that it is important to denounce the actions of Boko Haram and recommit ourselves to the protection of the Nigerian people and the recovery of the Chibok girls. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E28-E29] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SENSELESS CHRISTMASTIME KILLINGS BY BOKO HARAM AND THE NEED FOR THE WORLD'S RECOMMITMENT TO RECOVERING THE CHIBOK GIRLS ______ HON.

I believe that with our commitment, just as the Aboke girls were recovered after being kidnapped in Northern Uganda by the Lord's Resistance Army, the Chibok girls will be rescued, returned home and reintegrated back into the human family. I am committed to the protection of the Nigerian people and it is my view that the people of Nigeria and others in the Lake Chad Basin in Africa should be afforded the protection they deserve and the opportunity to live their lives free of terrorism and fear. This is why I introduced H. Res. 528, legislation that enjoyed bipartisan support of my [[Page E29]] colleagues including Representatives Chu of California, Lee of California, Dold of Illinois, Hahn of California, Kelly of Illinois, Fudge of Ohio, Watson-Coleman of New Jersey, Sewell of Alabama, Brown of Florida, Thompson of Mississippi and my good friend Ms. Wilson of Florida. My resolution seeks to create a Victims of Terror Protection Fund for the protection of the Chibok girls when they return home as well as provision of much needed support for them and other displaced refugees, migrants and the victims of Boko Haram's terror such as those of the Christmastime 2015 massacres. All persons of the world from Syria to Nigeria to Colombia and everywhere in between possess the inalienable fundamental human right to freedom of movement and full realization of their human potential without fear of violence upon their person. Last month, in our celebrations of the United Nations Human Rights Day, the global community rededicated itself to the key International Covenants on Human Rights: the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Covenants that serve as the bedrock of the International Bill of Rights: protecting the right of all human beings. Indeed, we must continue to fight for the freedoms of our neighbors whether those for whom we fight are out of sight such as the murdered and wounded in northeastern Nigeria or the kidnapped Chibok teenage girls or educated medical doctors fleeing violent extremism in Syria. The bottom line is that our obligations in the human family must revolve around and be grounded in our conviction and commitment to the rights to freedom of movement, freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and the freedom from fear or terrorism, among others. We must remain steadfast in guaranteeing these fundamental freedoms and protect the human rights of all to achieve peace and prosperity in our world. Mr. Speaker, those murdered and wounded during the Christmastime massacres included a lot of youth. When they were kidnapped, the Chibok youth were 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds who are now turning 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18--living out the formative years of their lives in captivity in the claws of thugs. Our silence is a waste of time and this is why we must keep speaking, keep tweeting, keep seeking to recover our daughters and denouncing the atrocious actions of Boko Haram. This cannot be the fate or the end of the story of the lives of the victims of Boko Haram. We must not and cannot forget Blessing Abana, Deborah Abari, Rebecca Mallum, Naomi Luka, Esther Markus, Zara Ishaku, Ruth Joshua, Grace Paul, Rebecca Luka and the others. To the families of the Christmastime massacre, you are in our thoughts and prayers. To the Chibok girls, notwithstanding your captivity, let me assure you that your spirits, souls and bodies are sacred to us, no matter what attacks the enemies of peace may have perpetrated upon you. Like your sister from Pakistan, Malala, who was shot in the head for seeking her education and who continues to fight for your recovery, your best days are ahead because we know that when your girls thrive our world thrives. So let me assure you that you remain in our prayers and thoughts. To President Buhari of Nigeria, you have our support and you have my support in all your efforts to destroy and dismantle Boko Haram. To the people of Nigeria, we are counting on you to keep holding on, keep your faith strong and be assured that you are on the right side of history and that the arc of the moral universe always tips on the right side of justice. Today, let me offer that it is important to denounce the actions of Boko Haram and recommit ourselves to the protection of the Nigerian people and the recovery of the Chibok girls.

northeastern nigerian cities of maiduguri and madagali, borno state, which is the birthplace of boko haram. today also marks 633 days since 276 chibok girls were kidnapped from their dormitories in the middle of night. violence on the citizens of the world in sacred places such as our homes, places of worship, educational institutions and recreational venues is unacceptable and detestable. to keep the chibok girls on our minds, all of us here in congress have worn red every wednesday to signal the urgency of rescuing, recovering and reintegrating these young women back into the arms of their parents. sadly, while we grapple with the sore of the kidnapping of the chibok girls, with horror, we watched on the news, violence wreaked by boko haram during the holidays. as we all know, boko haram has claimed responsibility for the massacres. i have met with the nigerian president and was part of a delegation to nigeria to engage local leaders, activists, businesses and families of victims of boko haram on strategies for recovering and reintegrating the chibok girls and many others who have been kidnapped or suffered violence. these senseless killings and kidnappings by boko haram must stop. the chibok girls are not throwaways and the world cannot and should not forget them. those who lost their lives during the christmastime massacres have families and loved ones whose hearts have been broken because of the pain and anguish they must now feel. we must continue to press on in our concerted efforts to assure victims that boko haram will be combatted and assure our

MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of new mexico in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a native New Mexican and dear friend, Deborah ``Deb'' Seligman. Deb can trace her New Mexican roots back to the 1800s when her ancestors owned a number of trading posts in New Mexico long before it became a state. Deb attended college at the Washington University of St. Louis and returned home to the University of New Mexico to study law--graduating in 1978. Today, she is a sole practicing attorney and represents banks and small businesses. In 2011, the New Mexico Business Weekly included her in the ``Best of the Bar''--a list of the top attorneys in the state. She was recognized for her excellence in business and corporate law. Deb is an exemplary citizen and has volunteered her time on numerous boards and charities. She is a board member of the local Casa Angelica (a home for children and young adults with developmental disabilities), the Jewish Community Center of Greater Albuquerque and the Jewish Historical Society. Deb is also the Commissioner and Chairwoman of the Village of Los Ranchos Planning and Zoning Commission. Furthermore, she is extremely generous in her donations to animal charities, including the Save the Manatees Club. Above all, I want to honor Deb for her latest feat, running in the Chicago marathon this past year. Deb took up running about 6 years ago and has run in numerous marathons since, including the New York City, San Francisco and Phoenix races. Deb runs with Albuquerque Fit, which recently awarded her for her tremendous improvement since joining the group. In the Chicago marathon, after extensive training and a refusal to quit, Deb achieved a personal best of four hours and fifty-five minutes. Deb and her husband, Judge Robert Mawe met in 1986 and were married three years later in 1989. Together, they are active in their community and the Democratic Party in New Mexico. Deb is one of the most determined and generous people I have met. Nothing can stop her. I am confident that she will continue to be a leader in our community and I look forward to hearing about her continued successes in the future. Congratulations Deb. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E29] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DEBORAH SELIGMAN ______ HON.

CREC-2016-01-11-pt1-PgE29-2,CREC-2016-01-11,114,NEW YORK TIMES ADDRESSES THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E29-E30] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NEW YORK TIMES ADDRESSES THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP ______ HON. MAXINE WATERS of california in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the following: [From the New York Times, December 31, 2015] Debt and the Racial Wealth Gap (By Paul Kiel) IF you are black, you're far more likely to see your electricity cut, more likely to be sued over a debt, and more likely to land in jail because of a parking ticket. It is not unreasonable to attribute these perils to discrimination. But there's no question that the main reason small financial problems can have such a disproportionate effect on black families is that, for largely historical reasons rooted in racism, they have far smaller financial reserves to fall back on than white families. The most recent federal survey in 2013 put the difference in net worth between the typical white and black family at $131,000. That's a big number, but here's an even more troubling statistic: About one-quarter of African-American families had less than $5 in reserve. Low-income whites had about $375. Any setback, from a medical emergency to the unexpected loss of hours at work, can be devastating. It means that harsh punishments for the failure to pay small debts harm black families inordinately. Sometimes, the consequence is jail. Other times, electricity is cut, or wages garnished. The modern roots of the racial wealth gap can be traced back to the post-World War II housing boom, when federal agencies blocked loans to black Americans, locking them out of the greatest wealth accumulation this country has ever experienced. More recently, the bursting of the housing bubble and subsequent recession slammed minorities. In 2013, the median wealth of white households was 13 times the median wealth of black households, the widest gap since 1989. Earlier this year, my colleague Annie Waldman and I took a close look at debt-collection lawsuits in three major American cities. We expected to see a pattern driven by income, with collectors and credit card lenders suing people most often in lower-income areas. But income was just half the story. Even accounting for income, the rate of court judgments from these lawsuits was twice as high in mostly black communities as it was in mostly white ones. In some neighborhoods in Newark and St. Louis, we found more than one judgment for every four residents over a five-year period. Many were families who, knocked off their feet by medical bills or job loss or other problems, had simply been unable to recover. When debts turn into court judgments, plaintiffs gain the power to collect by cleaning out bank accounts and seizing wages. Federal and state laws generally don't protect anyone but the poorest debtors, and because judgments are valid for a decade or more, the threat of garnishment can linger for years. The paycheck from that new job may suddenly be slashed and savings may disappear. Sometimes the consequence of not having the money to pay a bill is immediate: The power goes out. In a 2009 national survey of lower-income households by the federal Energy Information Administration, 9 percent [[Page E30]] of blacks reported having their electricity disconnected in the previous year because they had been unable to pay. For whites, the number was less than 4 percent, according to an analysis of the survey by the National Consumer Law Center. And sometimes the consequence of unmanageable debt is to fall further into debt. In a 2013 Federal Reserve survey, about three times as many blacks reported taking out a high- interest payday loan in the previous year as did whites at the same income level. Desperate consumers turn to these loans as a way to catch up on bills, but often get tripped up by unaffordable interest payments. When combined with discriminatory policing practices, the effect of the asset gap is to magnify the racial disparity. In its report on the Ferguson, Mo., Police Department, the Justice Department found that officers disproportionately stopped and ticketed black citizens. For a ``manner of walking'' violation, it was $302; for ``high grass and weeds,'' $531. Blacks accounted for about 67 percent of Ferguson's population and around 85 percent of the municipal court cases. But the numbers were even more lopsided when it came to the harshest consequences. Blacks accounted for 92 percent of the cases where an arrest warrant had been issued to compel payment. And this wasn't a problem only in Ferguson. Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union sued DeKalb County, Ga., which includes part of Atlanta, for jailing citizens over unpaid court fines and unpaid fees charged by a for- profit company that runs probation services for the government. About 55 percent of DeKalb County's population is black, but the A.C.L.U. found that nearly all probationers jailed for failure to pay those fines and fees were black. The racial wealth gap ``creates this cyclical effect,'' said Nusrat Choudhury, an A.C.L.U. attorney. An unpaid speeding ticket may result in a suspended driver's license, which may lead to a more severe violation. Unable to pay their fines, black defendants become more crushingly entangled in debt. Cori Winfield, a single mother in St. Louis, got caught up in this cycle. After she was unable to keep up the payments on a subprime auto loan she took out in 2009, the car was repossessed the next year, but the consequences didn't stop there. Because the debt continued to be bloated by interest charges, the lender began garnishing her wages in 2012. The garnishment continues today. Because she was unable to repay, she will end up paying far more than she owed in the first place. Making matters worse for Ms. Winfield, while her wages were being garnished, she was arrested for driving with a license that had been suspended because she had failed to pay a speeding ticket. She ended up spending a weekend in jail and having to pay the cost of bail. Ms. Winfield has a decent clerical job, earning about $30,000 a year. But she lives month to month. When hit with an unexpected expense, she is left reeling. Her vulnerability is typical. In a recent survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the typical black household earning between $25,000 and $50,000 reported having emergency savings of $400. The typical white household in that range had $2,100. Black families were much more likely to report difficulty in recovering from a financial setback or to have fallen behind on a bill in the past year. This financial insecurity extended up the income scale. Of black households with income between $50,000 and $85,000, 30 percent said they had been unable to pay a bill. By contrast, only white households with incomes below $25,000 reported similar trouble paying bills; 31 percent said they had fallen behind. What can be done? The best place to start is by identifying practices that are particularly damaging to black communities, and then fixing them. In Missouri, for example, the attorney general recently proposed a series of reforms for debt-collection lawsuits to ensure that the underlying debt was valid and that lawyers' fees were not excessive. Collection-industry trade groups supported the proposal. Lawmakers in Missouri and other states could go further and reduce the amount of income subject to garnishment. In most states (New York and New Jersey are exceptions), defendants can lose a quarter of their post-tax income, a big hit for even middle-income families. Bank accounts are afforded even less protection, allowing collectors to seize funds without limit. It's a nonsensical system that restricts how much of a worker's paycheck a collector can seize, but allows collectors to take the entire amount once that check is deposited. Setting even a small dollar amount as automatically off limits to collectors would be a substantial improvement. Changes like that benefit everyone, but they particularly help black families. Policy makers should pay attention. Making it easier to recover from small setbacks can make a big difference in people's lives. Paul Kiel is a consumer finance reporter for ProPublica. This is part of its series on debt collection. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E29-E30] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NEW YORK TIMES ADDRESSES THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP ______ HON.

About 55 percent of DeKalb County's population is black, but the A.C.L.U. found that nearly all probationers jailed for failure to pay those fines and fees were black. The racial wealth gap ``creates this cyclical effect,'' said Nusrat Choudhury, an A.C.L.U. attorney. An unpaid speeding ticket may result in a suspended driver's license, which may lead to a more severe violation. Unable to pay their fines, black defendants become more crushingly entangled in debt. Cori Winfield, a single mother in St. Louis, got caught up in this cycle. After she was unable to keep up the payments on a subprime auto loan she took out in 2009, the car was repossessed the next year, but the consequences didn't stop there. Because the debt continued to be bloated by interest charges, the lender began garnishing her wages in 2012. The garnishment continues today. Because she was unable to repay, she will end up paying far more than she owed in the first place. Making matters worse for Ms. Winfield, while her wages were being garnished, she was arrested for driving with a license that had been suspended because she had failed to pay a speeding ticket. She ended up spending a weekend in jail and having to pay the cost of bail. Ms. Winfield has a decent clerical job, earning about $30,000 a year. But she lives month to month. When hit with an unexpected expense, she is left reeling. Her vulnerability is typical. In a recent survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the typical black household earning between $25,000 and $50,000 reported having emergency savings of $400. The typical white household in that range had $2,100. Black families were much more likely to report difficulty in recovering from a financial setback or to have fallen behind on a bill in the past year. This financial insecurity extended up the income scale. Of black households with income between $50,000 and $85,000, 30 percent said they had been unable to pay a bill. By contrast, only white households with incomes below $25,000 reported similar trouble paying bills; 31 percent said they had fallen behind. What can be done? The best place to start is by identifying practices that are particularly damaging to black communities, and then fixing them. In Missouri, for example, the attorney general recently proposed a series of reforms for debt-collection lawsuits to ensure that the underlying debt was valid and that lawyers' fees were not excessive. Collection-industry trade groups supported the proposal. Lawmakers in Missouri and other states could go further and reduce the amount of income subject to garnishment. In most states (New York and New Jersey are exceptions), defendants can lose a quarter of their post-tax income, a big hit for even middle-income families. Bank accounts are afforded even less protection, allowing collectors to seize funds without limit. It's a nonsensical system that restricts how much of a worker's paycheck a collector can seize, but allows collectors to take the entire amount once that check is deposited. Setting even a small dollar amount as automatically off limits to collectors would be a substantial improvement. Changes like that benefit everyone, but they particularly help black families. Policy makers should pay attention. Making it easier to recover from small setbacks can make a big difference in people's lives. Paul Kiel is a consumer finance reporter for ProPublica.

MAXINE WATERS of california in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the following: [From the New York Times, December 31, 2015] Debt and the Racial Wealth Gap (By Paul Kiel) IF you are black, you're far more likely to see your electricity cut, more likely to be sued over a debt, and more likely to land in jail because of a parking ticket. It is not unreasonable to attribute these perils to discrimination. But there's no question that the main reason small financial problems can have such a disproportionate effect on black families is that, for largely historical reasons rooted in racism, they have far smaller financial reserves to fall back on than white families. The most recent federal survey in 2013 put the difference in net worth between the typical white and black family at $131,000. That's a big number, but here's an even more troubling statistic: About one-quarter of African-American families had less than $5 in reserve. Low-income whites had about $375. Any setback, from a medical emergency to the unexpected loss of hours at work, can be devastating. It means that harsh punishments for the failure to pay small debts harm black families inordinately. Sometimes, the consequence is jail. Other times, electricity is cut, or wages garnished. The modern roots of the racial wealth gap can be traced back to the post-World War II housing boom, when federal agencies blocked loans to black Americans, locking them out of the greatest wealth accumulation this country has ever experienced. More recently, the bursting of the housing bubble and subsequent recession slammed minorities. In 2013, the median wealth of white households was 13 times the median wealth of black households, the widest gap since 1989. Earlier this year, my colleague Annie Waldman and I took a close look at debt-collection lawsuits in three major American cities. We expected to see a pattern driven by income, with collectors and credit card lenders suing people most often in lower-income areas. But income was just half the story. Even accounting for income, the rate of court judgments from these lawsuits was twice as high in mostly black communities as it was in mostly white ones. In some neighborhoods in Newark and St. Louis, we found more than one judgment for every four residents over a five-year period. Many were families who, knocked off their feet by medical bills or job loss or other problems, had simply been unable to recover. When debts turn into court judgments, plaintiffs gain the power to collect by cleaning out bank accounts and seizing wages. Federal and state laws generally don't protect anyone but the poorest debtors, and because judgments are valid for a decade or more, the threat of garnishment can linger for years. The paycheck from that new job may suddenly be slashed and savings may disappear. Sometimes the consequence of not having the money to pay a bill is immediate: The power goes out. In a 2009 national survey of lower-income households by the federal Energy Information Administration, 9 percent [[Page E30]] of blacks reported having their electricity disconnected in the previous year because they had been unable to pay. For whites, the number was less than 4 percent, according to an analysis of the survey by the National Consumer Law Center. And sometimes the consequence of unmanageable debt is to fall further into debt. In a 2013 Federal Reserve survey, about three times as many blacks reported taking out a high- interest payday loan in the previous year as did whites at the same income level. Desperate consumers turn to these loans as a way to catch up on bills, but often get tripped up by unaffordable interest payments. When combined with discriminatory policing practices, the effect of the asset gap is to magnify the racial disparity. In its report on the Ferguson, Mo., Police Department, the Justice Department found that officers disproportionately stopped and ticketed black citizens. For a ``manner of walking'' violation, it was $302; for ``high grass and weeds,'' $531. Blacks accounted for about 67 percent of Ferguson's population and around 85 percent of the municipal court cases. But the numbers were even more lopsided when it came to the harshest consequences. Blacks accounted for 92 percent of the cases where an arrest warrant had been issued to compel payment. And this wasn't a problem only in Ferguson. Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union sued DeKalb County, Ga., which includes part of Atlanta, for jailing citizens over unpaid court fines and unpaid fees charged by a for- profit company that runs probation services for the government.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Dale Leon Bumpers, a great American, a man who embodied civility and bipartisanship; one of the most passionate advocates for civil rights, social justice, and nuclear non-proliferation; a man who served his country honorably in the Armed Forces, the Arkansas Statehouse, and the United States Senate. Dale Bumpers died at his home in Little Rock, Arkansas, on January 1, 2016 at the age of 90. Dale Bumpers was born August 12, 1925, in Charleston, Arkansas, to Lattie (Jones) and William Rufus Bumpers, who had served a term in the Arkansas House of Representatives of Arkansas, encouraged his son to attend all local political events telling him that there was, ``nothing as exhilarating as a political victory and nothing as rewarding or as honorable as being a dedicated, honest politician who actually makes things better and more just.'' Dale Bumpers came of age during the lean years of the Great Depression, which instilled in him an ethic of hard work and a compassion for those in need, what the great biographer Robert Caro quotes Sam Early Johnson as being caught in the ``tentacles of circumstance.'' In 1943, Dale Bumpers put his studies at the University of Arkansas on hold to enlist in the United States Marines, serving in the Pacific Theater during World War II. After his honorable discharge from the Marines, Dale Bumpers earned his baccalaureate degree from the University of Arkansas and then moved to Evanston, Illinois to attend Northwestern University School of Law, from which he graduated in 1951. In 1949, two fateful events occurred: tragically his beloved parents were killed in an automobile accident; but happily, he married his high school sweetheart and the love of his life, Betty Lou Flanagan, and together they raised their three children in Charleston, Arkansas. Upon graduation from law school and his admission to the Arkansas State Bar in 1952, Dale Bumpers entered the private practice of law, a field in which his natural charm, quick wit, and folksy manner, allowed him to excel. Between 1952 and 1970, he won every case he handled except three, which validated the title of his memoir which was, The Best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town. After the Supreme Court's Landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education, the Charleston School Board asked his advice on how to best respond to the Court's decision. Dale Bumpers's response was quick and direct: compliance rather than defiance was his advice, which was heeded by the School Board. In 1962, Dale Bumpers ran for the House seat that his father once held and although he handily carried his home city of Charleston, he narrowly lost the election. [[Page E31]] But the loss neither discouraged nor deterred Dale Bumpers from seeking elective office so he could continue to serve others. Opportunity presented itself in the 1970 Arkansas gubernatorial race. The Democratic primary field included racist former Governor Orval Faubus, who had served six terms from 1954 to 1966, Attorney General Joe Edward Purcell, and Arkansas House Speaker Hayes McClerkin. An early poll showed Dale Bumpers with about one percent of the vote but compelling television ads showcasing his integrity, winning personality, progressivism attracted broad and enthusiastic public support, especially in western Arkansas, and earned him a spot in the run-off election with Orval Faubus, which he won with 62% of the vote. In the general election, Dale Bumpers soundly defeated the incumbent Republican governor, Winthrop Rockefeller, who was seeking a third term. During his first term as Arkansas Governor, Dale Bumpers guided to passage laws that gave more powers to the cities, created a consumer protection division in the Attorney General's office, repealed the ``fair trade'' liquor law, expanded the state park system, improved social services for elderly, disabled, and developmentally challenged citizens. During his second term Dale Bumpers continued to pursue a progressive reform agenda and won passage of legislation creating state-supported kindergarten, providing for free textbooks for high school students, authorizing a major construction program at the state's colleges, eliminating the prison ``trusty'' system, and increased support of the community college system through increased state payments of operational costs. Despite the fact Dale Bumpers governorship was widely viewed as a success, by friends and critics alike, he did not enjoy the position, writing in his autobiography that he, ``intensely disliked most of my time as governor'' because ``I spent more time trying to make sure bad things didn't happen than I spent trying to make good things happen.'' In 1974, as he was completing his second term as governor, Dale Bumpers decided to challenge the incumbent U.S. senator, the legendary J. William Fulbright, in the Democratic senatorial primary. Because of his admiration, support, and friendship, Dale Bumpers was reluctant to enter the race against the politically vulnerable Senator Fulbright, writing in his memoir: I didn't want to oppose him; on the other hand, I would never forgive myself if he was defeated by someone whose views were an anathema to me. Dale Bumpers won the Democratic primary with 65% percent of the vote and went on to win the general election against John Harris Jones with 85% of the vote, the largest margin of victory in a statewide election in 30 years. Dale Bumpers was sworn in as United States Senator in January 1975; he was easily reelected in 1980, 1986, and 1992. In the course of his 28 year career, Dale Bumpers, nicknamed ``the giant killer'' by the New York Times, would defeat former or future Arkansas governors: Orval Faubus, Winthrop Rockefeller, Asa Hutchinson, and Mike Huckabee. During his twenty-four-year career in the United States Senate, Dale Bumpers served as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee and was a senior member of the Committees on Appropriations and on Energy and Natural Resources from which perch he championed environmental legislation and efforts to expand and fund the National Park System. Though as a fiscal conservative, Senator Bumpers was an early supporter of efforts to reduce the national debt and was often a critic of excessive military spending. Dale Bumpers retired from the Senate in 1998 but one of the greatest orators ever to serve in the Senate returned to the chamber the following year to deliver the speech for which he is perhaps best known, the powerful, persuasive, compelling, and widely praised closing argument leading to acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. Mr. Speaker, Dale Leon Bumpers was a legislator's legislator and our prayers and condolences go out to his widow, Betty Lou Flanagan, his children, Brent, Bill, and Brooke. Dale Leon Bumpers touched so many lives in so many helpful ways that he will always be remembered as one of the finest public servants of the 20th century. I ask that the House observe a moment of silence in memory of the distinguished United States Senator from Arkansas, the late Dale Leon Bumpers. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E30-E31] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN REMEMBRANCE OF DALE BUMPERS U.S. SENATOR, GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS, AND FIGHTER FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND PROGRESSIVE REFORMS ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Dale Leon Bumpers, a great American, a man who embodied civility and bipartisanship; one of the most passionate advocates for civil rights, social justice, and nuclear non-proliferation; a man who served his country honorably in the Armed Forces, the Arkansas Statehouse, and the United States Senate. Dale Bumpers died at his home in Little Rock, Arkansas, on January 1, 2016 at the age of 90. Dale Bumpers was born August 12, 1925, in Charleston, Arkansas, to Lattie (Jones) and William Rufus Bumpers, who had served a term in the Arkansas House of Representatives of Arkansas, encouraged his son to attend all local political events telling him that there was, ``nothing as exhilarating as a political victory and nothing as rewarding or as honorable as being a dedicated, honest politician who actually makes things better and more just.'' Dale Bumpers came of age during the lean years of the Great Depression, which instilled in him an ethic of hard work and a compassion for those in need, what the great biographer Robert Caro quotes Sam Early Johnson as being caught in the ``tentacles of circumstance.'' In 1943, Dale Bumpers put his studies at the University of Arkansas on hold to enlist in the United States Marines, serving in the Pacific Theater during World War II. After his honorable discharge from the Marines, Dale Bumpers earned his baccalaureate degree from the University of Arkansas and then moved to Evanston, Illinois to attend Northwestern University School of Law, from which he graduated in 1951. In 1949, two fateful events occurred: tragically his beloved parents were killed in an automobile accident; but happily, he married his high school sweetheart and the love of his life, Betty Lou Flanagan, and together they raised their three children in Charleston, Arkansas. Upon graduation from law school and his admission to the Arkansas State Bar in 1952, Dale Bumpers entered the private practice of law, a field in which his natural charm, quick wit, and folksy manner, allowed him to excel. Between 1952 and 1970, he won every case he handled except three, which validated the title of his memoir which was, The Best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town. After the Supreme Court's Landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education, the Charleston School Board asked his advice on how to best respond to the Court's decision. Dale Bumpers's response was quick and direct: compliance rather than defiance was his advice, which was heeded by the School Board. In 1962, Dale Bumpers ran for the House seat that his father once held and although he handily carried his home city of Charleston, he narrowly lost the election. [[Page E31]] But the loss neither discouraged nor deterred Dale Bumpers from seeking elective office so he could continue to serve others. Opportunity presented itself in the 1970 Arkansas gubernatorial race. The Democratic primary field included racist former Governor Orval Faubus, who had served six terms from 1954 to 1966, Attorney General Joe Edward Purcell, and Arkansas House Speaker Hayes McClerkin. An early poll showed Dale Bumpers with about one percent of the vote but compelling television ads showcasing his integrity, winning personality, progressivism attracted broad and enthusiastic public support, especially in western Arkansas, and earned him a spot in the run-off election with Orval Faubus, which he won with 62% of the vote. In the general election, Dale Bumpers soundly defeated the incumbent Republican governor, Winthrop Rockefeller, who was seeking a third term. During his first term as Arkansas Governor, Dale Bumpers guided to passage laws that gave more powers to the cities, created a consumer protection division in the Attorney General's office, repealed the ``fair trade'' liquor law, expanded the state park system, improved social services for elderly, disabled, and developmentally challenged citizens. During his second term Dale Bumpers continued to pursue a progressive reform agenda and won passage of legislation creating state-supported kindergarten, providing for free textbooks for high school students, authorizing a major construction program at the state's colleges, eliminating the prison ``trusty'' system, and increased support of the community college system through increased state payments of operational costs. Despite the fact Dale Bumpers governorship was widely viewed as a success, by friends and critics alike, he did not enjoy the position, writing in his autobiography that he, ``intensely disliked most of my time as governor'' because ``I spent more time trying to make sure bad things didn't happen than I spent trying to make good things happen.'' In 1974, as he was completing his second term as governor, Dale Bumpers decided to challenge the incumbent U.S. senator, the legendary J. William Fulbright, in the Democratic senatorial primary. Because of his admiration, support, and friendship, Dale Bumpers was reluctant to enter the race against the politically vulnerable Senator Fulbright, writing in his memoir: I didn't want to oppose him; on the other hand, I would never forgive myself if he was defeated by someone whose views were an anathema to me. Dale Bumpers won the Democratic primary with 65% percent of the vote and went on to win the general election against John Harris Jones with 85% of the vote, the largest margin of victory in a statewide election in 30 years. Dale Bumpers was sworn in as United States Senator in January 1975; he was easily reelected in 1980, 1986, and 1992. In the course of his 28 year career, Dale Bumpers, nicknamed ``the giant killer'' by the New York Times, would defeat former or future Arkansas governors: Orval Faubus, Winthrop Rockefeller, Asa Hutchinson, and Mike Huckabee. During his twenty-four-year career in the United States Senate, Dale Bumpers served as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee and was a senior member of the Committees on Appropriations and on Energy and Natural Resources from which perch he championed environmental legislation and efforts to expand and fund the National Park System. Though as a fiscal conservative, Senator Bumpers was an early supporter of efforts to reduce the national debt and was often a critic of excessive military spending. Dale Bumpers retired from the Senate in 1998 but one of the greatest orators ever to serve in the Senate returned to the chamber the following year to deliver the speech for which he is perhaps best known, the powerful, persuasive, compelling, and widely praised closing argument leading to acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. Mr. Speaker, Dale Leon Bumpers was a legislator's legislator and our prayers and condolences go out to his widow, Betty Lou Flanagan, his children, Brent, Bill, and Brooke. Dale Leon Bumpers touched so many lives in so many helpful ways that he will always be remembered as one of the finest public servants of the 20th century.

For more than 30 years, Bob has taught history and civics in high schools around Atlanta. Over the years Mr. Rumble has been an active participant in Close Up, an organization that brings students and teachers from around the country to Washington D.C. to promote interactive civic engagement. This week marks Mr. Rumble's 30th student trip to D.C. [[Page E32]] Mr. Rumble first took over the Close Up program at Stone Mountain High School in 1985. In 1993 he led the Close Up program at Heritage High School. Later in his career, Mr. Rumble chartered the program at both Roswell and Cambridge High Schools. Most recently Bob brought Close Up to his current position as a history teacher at Kings Ridge Christian School in Alpharetta. Through the Close Up program, Mr. Rumble has given his students a hands-on experience of what he taught in the classroom. Some of his former students and Close Up participants were able to join him this week on what may be Bob's last trip. Mr. Speaker I want to commend Mr. Rumble for his years of dedication and service to our community.

MIRANDA _____ HON. JUAN VARGAS of california in the house of representatives Monday, January 11, 2016 Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Miguel C. Miranda, a true leader and servant of the community of Brawley. Mr. Miranda passed away on Tuesday, December 29, 2015, in his beloved city of Brawley. Miguel was born on August 30, 1957, in Brawley to his parents, Miguel and Hipolita Miranda. He attended Miguel Hidalgo School, Barbara Worth Junior High School and Brawley Union High School, where he graduated in 1976. In high school he was in the cadets, and on the football and wrestling team. Mr. Miranda attended Imperial Valley College. From a young age, Miguel was an active member in the Brawley community. He served as an altar boy at St. Margaret Mary Church. Later, he would serve as the church's Hospitality Ministry member and parishioner. Throughout his life, Miguel played many roles within the Brawley community. He was actively involved with the Brown Society, Poor Side of Town and Latin Cruisers Low Riders Car Clubs. He was an honorary member of Hidalgo Society and during his 40 years, he was an active member, past president and served in other board roles. Other public service memberships included Brawley Parks and Recreation Commissioner, Imperial Valley College Affirmative Action Advisory, Pioneers Memorial Hospital Intensive Care Foundation Advisory Council, Brawley American Citizens Club Member and past political chairman, California Rural Legal Assistance board member, Imperial County Manpower Panning Council, North-End Optimist Club and Imperial Valley Housing Authority. He was a past member and Grand Knight of the Knights of Columbus Council 2130, and a member of the Brawley Elementary School District Advisory Committee. Miguel was also a coach, supporter, fan, and friend of the Brawley Junior Gladiators Wrestling and Brawley Union High School Wrestling Programs. He participated in the Los Camperos Camping Group. Miguel also served a judge for community contests, such as the Chili Cook-Off and the Jalapeno Eating Contest, a contest Miguel won for several years in a row. Miguel was employed by Friends Outside as a Family Liaison Specialist at Calipatria State Prison and was previously employed by the Institute for Social Economic Justice, SER Jobs for Progress, Work Training Center, Campesinos Unidos Inc., and Brawley Elementary School District. In 2001, Miguel was Board President of the Clinicas del Salud del Pueblo, and in November 2015, he was voted by his constituents to serve as the City of Brawley Treasurer. He had previously served the City of Brawley as a Council Member and Mayor pro-tempore. Miguel's constant involvement in the community earned him the friendly title, ``Amigo de la Comunidad'' (Friend of the Community). Miguel was an outstanding individual, husband, father, papa Mike, brother, brother-in-law (cunado), son-in-law (yerno), uncle (tio), buddy (compa) and friend to many. He was considerate, genuine, devoted, and an avid Raiders Booster Club fan. He loved spending time with his family. In 1981, he met the love of his life, Estela Robles, and was married in April of 1982. He was enormously proud of his family, and they of him. Miguel will be missed by his family--his wife, Estela; son and daughter-in-law, Miguel Jr. and Danitza, son, Alex; daughter, Vanessa; future son-in-law, Andres; and his new grandson, Michael Angel--and his Brawley community. I want to commemorate Miguel Miranda for all lifetime of service to his community. His leadership is sure to leave a lasting legacy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 6 (Monday, January 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E32] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MIGUEL C.
