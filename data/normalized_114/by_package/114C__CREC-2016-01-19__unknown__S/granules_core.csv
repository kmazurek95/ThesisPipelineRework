CREC-2016-01-19-pt1-PgS79-7,CREC-2016-01-19,114,AMERICAN SAFE ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S79] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN SAFE ACT Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is clear that many Americans are concerned about the administration's ability to properly vet thousands of individuals from Syria and Iraq. Elected officials in both parties have expressed concern, too, as have administration officials. That is why many Americans are asking us to take a step back and press pause on the program so we can ensure that we have the correct policies and security screenings actually in place. The Senate will consider balanced, bipartisan legislation tomorrow to do just that. Passing the American SAFE Act, which the House has already done with a bipartisan veto-proof margin, would show Americans that their concerns are being heard here in Washington. The aim is to ensure that we have facts first so we can help advance America's tradition of compassion and address the legitimate concerns of her citizens at the same time. I will have more to say on this legislation tomorrow, but I urge colleagues across the aisle to treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves. This debate should be driven by facts and common sense and not fear mongering about targeting widows and orphans or other straw man arguments the White House has made from time to time. Americans deserve a vetting process they can have confidence in, and frankly the refugees coming to this country deserve one too. Safeguards that weed out ISIL sympathizers can help ensure legitimate refugees to our country are not unfairly stigmatized. The American people are concerned and looking to us to lead with both safety and compassion. I am calling on colleagues to help us do so tomorrow by advancing this balanced and bipartisan legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S79] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN SAFE ACT Mr. McCONNELL.

CREC-2016-01-19-pt1-PgS79-10,CREC-2016-01-19,114,NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S79-S80] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will have more to say tomorrow about the legislation about which the Republican leader just spoke. Tomorrow afternoon we will have a vote as to whether we should move to the bill. Along with the rest of the world, I was pleased to learn this weekend that five political prisoners were finally released from Iran and will soon be home with their families. These Americans were unjustly held, and I am glad they will soon be in the arms of their loved ones once again. [[Page S80]] Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is one of the most pressing security challenges of our generation. A nuclear-armed Iran is a threat to the national security of the United States, the State of Israel, and the world. Last summer I announced my support for the historic nuclear agreement the United States and the global community made with Iran. This agreement required Iran to take significant steps to ensure that its nuclear infrastructure could not be used to build a nuclear bomb. These steps include, among other things, dismantling thousands and thousands of centrifuges that are used to enrich uranium, removing from Iran its enriched uranium, thus reducing its stockpile and eliminating the core of its plutonium reactor. The end result of these steps is that Iran's breakout time--the time it takes to make enough fissile material to build a bomb--has been extended from a matter of a few months to a year, and some experts would say much, much longer. Over the weekend, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Iran successfully implemented these initial requirements, an important next act in the implementation of the nuclear agreement. I applaud President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Dr. Ernest Moniz, and Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman for using America's diplomatic power to make the world a safer place. This diplomatic approach also avoids the significant costs and risks a military option would pose. One need only look at Iraq to find out what military options cost--trillions of dollars--because of the worst foreign policy decision in the history of our country: the invasion of Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead, millions have been displaced, thousands of Americans are dead, and tens of thousands badly wounded. The diplomatic approach avoids the costs and risks the nuclear option poses. No one should think all of the components of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action have been completed. They have not been.

A nuclear-armed Iran is a threat to the national security of the United States, the State of Israel, and the world. Last summer I announced my support for the historic nuclear agreement the United States and the global community made with Iran. This agreement required Iran to take significant steps to ensure that its nuclear infrastructure could not be used to build a nuclear bomb.

CREC-2016-01-19-pt1-PgS81,CREC-2016-01-19,114,FAST ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S81-S82] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAST ACT Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk about something that was overlooked late in the year as we passed the surface transportation bill--the highway bill. It was called the Fix America's Surface Transportation Act or the FAST Act. It wasn't very fast. I am glad to see the President signed the law last month. It is one of the things people understand they can't do for themselves--along with defending the country--having a transportation system that works and taking advantage of who we are as a nation, being strategically located in as fine a place as you can be to do business, to create jobs and opportunity all over the world. The FAST Act in my State would provide $5 billion to Missouri over the next 5 years to improve our roads, bridges, and rail system. That is the amount of money we will send in over the next 5 years. We are either slightly a donee State or slightly a donor State. We might be better off if we kept all the money, but that is not what is happening right now. We are certainly better off if we know what the highway program looks like for 5 years. An effective transportation plan is good for the country, but it is particularly good where I live. If you look at any map of the river structure of the country or any railroad map of the country or any highway map of the country, a significant part of coming together of all three of those--rail, water, and highways--all happens right where we live. Because we are the hub of the railway, highway, and water systems, it is very important that we have a system that makes the most of that where we live. When I had a chance to speak to the Missouri House of Representatives in Jefferson City over the first week of the year, I told the Missouri General Assembly that this is a competitive advantage for us, but we need to make the most of it. When we had the highway bill that we have had in the 5 years the Presiding Officer and I have served in the Senate, nobody could rely on anything. This is the first 5-year bill we have had in 17 years. But before 2009, we just ended a 4-year highway bill. Then, since 2009, we have had 37 short-term extensions of the highway bill. So if there is anything fast about the FAST Act, it certainly wasn't quickly getting to a highway bill that works. The longest of those 37 extensions was 2 years. I think the second longest may have been 6 months. Not only is that no way to build roads and bridges, but it is clearly no way for legislators to have an idea in our home States of how to respond to that plan. By the time you try to figure out how to respond to the plan, how you can maximize it to the advantage of your State--my State or anybody else's--and how we can maximize that plan to our advantage, the plan is over with. By the time you have a legislative session, look at the plan, the State department of transportation analyzes it, and you start talking about it, the 6-month extension of the highway bill is over--or even the 2-year extension. There are all kinds of studies that indicate a significant loss of what you can buy with the money you are spending if the highway bill is 2 years or less. I think the discount is about 30 percent because people don't bid as competitively as they would bid to be part of those projects. They are not willing to move people to where a major project needs to occur. They cannot buy the equipment and plan to depreciate it out. So you wind up paying a lot more than you would have to pay. That is where we have been since 2009. The States have been the place where they didn't have any way to maximize a Federal program because the Federal program was gone before they could really calculate how they could most take advantage of it. So I hope that now we do one of the things that people really expect the government to do--one of the reasons they pay the taxes and one of the reasons the tax for transportation has always been pretty well received. People think: OK, I pay a tax when I fill up my car with gasoline, fill up my car with diesel, fill up my truck with diesel or fill up my truck with fuel. When I do that, I pay a tax and then I use the roads. So that seems fairer to people than most taxes, but we haven't had a system that allowed us to make the most of that. In our State, 22 percent of the major roads of Missouri are now considered in poor condition. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives us a C, and this is one of the areas where we would want to be an A. If you are a C instead of an A, the average Missouri motorist pays about $400 more a year in extra maintenance because we are trying to maintain a system that has gotten into poor condition. Some 44 percent of our highways are congested. Congestion costs motorists a lot of money in just wasted fuel. You don't have to spend much time around Washington in a car to realize how much time you can waste in traffic, but we see that happening more and more all over the country. In our State we have more bridges than any other State, and they are in among the worst conditions of the country, with 30 percent of our bridges rated as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. There was just a TIGER grant awarded to replace the Champ Clark Bridge across the Mississippi River, which I believe was built in 1919. If that bridge has to be shut down before it can be replaced or would have been shut down, the detour to get to where that bridge gets you is 75 or 80 miles driving around to where that bridge currently takes people. We have many bridges in our State that are county bridges; they are not State bridges. I have talked to county commissioners, and one of their principal concerns is this: What about the fund that helps us with our off-system bridges? Senator Casey and I created a fund to do this in 2012. We added it to the 2012 highway bill. Since then, it has provided about $775 million annually to States. Out of that State fund, whenever you are part of the off-system road system, the State pays 85 percent of a bridge that the county otherwise in most cases wouldn't be able to replace. We have one county that I think [[Page S82]] has 4,000 people and 40 bridges. That is a lot of bridges for 4,000 people to try to be responsible for. It is our smallest county, and that is maybe a different debate, but they have 40 bridges. We have many bridges in our State. The county road-county bridge system has about 50 percent of all the bridges we have in Missouri. The bridge system and the highway system are critical to us if we want to compete. As the middle of the country grows things and makes things, it is a great opportunity for us to get things--not just onto the river system and onto the railway system--all over the country and all other the world. Transportation really matters. The FAST Act--and I have a hard time saying the FAST Act without thinking how slow the FAST Act really was in getting passed--creates two freight-based programs that allows States to compete for funding for major projects. In a world where we want to compete, we need to figure out how we can compete more effectively. How do you get things to places where they are made into products? How do you get things that are grown and need to be shipped to places? How do you get them to places in a better way? In the life of this bill, the State of Missouri should receive about $150 million to look at those freight projects because those projects and the effective use of how you get things to places create jobs. The Missouri Department of Transportation has already developed a State freight plan to encourage strategies. Now this bill makes that plan more of a reality. The FAST Act also includes some help for our Nation's rail systems. I had a bill, the Track, Railroad, and Infrastructure Network Act, that when you are improving a railroad system, it allows you to have the same kind of streamlining that we were recently able to provide for highway construction. You don't get caught up on something that has to be needlessly litigated for long periods of time when, in fact, what you really need to be doing is getting that highway finished in the highway part of this bill or have the expedited ability for these issues to go to the top of the list and to get resolved so that people can get the things they make where they want to get them. They can get the things they buy quicker than they would get them otherwise. They can get to work, they can get to school, and they can get to the hospital when somebody is sick. I mentioned that, particularly because we just had floods in our State in the last few days. For a while, Interstate 70, Interstate 44, and Interstate 55--all three--were closed. There was a time when two of those were closed at the same time. They were closed for 24 to 36 hours, and it makes a difference in how people are able to live their lives. The Federal Permitting Improvement Act that I cosponsored was also included in the bill. This is a piece of legislation that Senator Portman and Senator McCaskill introduced. It will now allow better coordination between the deadline setting for permitting decisions--the same kind of thing for highways that we are also doing for railroads-- to make this important transportation system work. Looking at the United States, Winston Churchill once said we were the best located country in the world--an ocean on either side and neighbors that we could deal with north and south. And the ability to get anywhere would be another addition to that location advantage we have. The FAST Act includes two important provisions to give relief to electricity providers. One is a law that creates emergency route working groups for electricity and other things. If you have a vehicle that needs to get from Oklahoma to Joplin, MO, after the tornado, you don't have to get it especially permitted and authorized to come across that State line in what has been declared an emergency. The same thing would have happened in recent days in several places in our State close to a border, close to the equipment they need. The flood means there is an emergency. Now those vehicles can cross the State line without having to have the special permission that needed to be received in the past. Secondly, the Grid Reliability Act that I introduced with my Missouri colleague Senator McCaskill simply improves reliability. If you have two conflicting Federal agencies--one saying you can only use that plant so much of the time and another saying we have an electric emergency--you have to use every facility you have to provide the electricity that is needed, and that can now be done. There are many committees of jurisdiction here. The commerce committee that I am a member of is certainly the committee that is focused on infrastructure, focused on ports and other things that I haven't mentioned a lot but that are very important. I have mentioned at other times on the floor of the Senate that this is one of the great accomplishments of the first year of this Congress that may easily go overlooked, but I can tell you that county officials all over America and State legislative bodies all over America are looking at this bill and figuring out how do we use this as a way to move our transportation system into the 21st century, how do we use this to help provide opportunity, and how do we use this to help provide the kinds of jobs that provide the kind of pay that families need to live on and to live the kinds of lives they would like to live. I look forward to seeing this bill implemented. I think all of us need to watch carefully to be sure that we are making the most of one of the responsibilities of government. Defending the country and having a transportation system that works are both things that individuals and families can't do for themselves. I believe the FAST Act gives us a better chance than we have had since 2009 to look at the future with a greater degree of certainty and to work in an area that is critically important for the country but even more important for Missouri and others who live in the middle of these transportation networks, where they come together. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford).

This is the first 5-year bill we have had in 17 years. But before 2009, we just ended a 4-year highway bill. Then, since 2009, we have had 37 short-term extensions of the highway bill. So if there is anything fast about the FAST Act, it certainly wasn't quickly getting to a highway bill that works. The longest of those 37 extensions was 2 years. I think the second longest may have been 6 months. Not only is that no way to build roads and bridges, but it is clearly no way for legislators to have an idea in our home States of how to respond to that plan. By the time you try to figure out how to respond to the plan, how you can maximize it to the advantage of your State--my State or anybody else's--and how we can maximize that plan to our advantage, the plan is over with. By the time you have a legislative session, look at the plan, the State department of transportation analyzes it, and you start talking about it, the 6-month extension of the highway bill is over--or even the 2-year extension. There are all kinds of studies that indicate a significant loss of what you can buy with the money you are spending if the highway bill is 2 years or less. I think the discount is about 30 percent because people don't bid as competitively as they would bid to be part of those projects. They are not willing to move people to where a major project needs to occur. They cannot buy the equipment and plan to depreciate it out. So you wind up paying a lot more than you would have to pay. That is where we have been since 2009. The States have been the place where they didn't have any way to maximize a Federal program because the Federal program was gone before they could really calculate how they could most take advantage of it. So I hope that now we do one of the things that people really expect the government to do--one of the reasons they pay the taxes and one of the reasons the tax for transportation has always been pretty well received. People think: OK, I pay a tax when I fill up my car with gasoline, fill up my car with diesel, fill up my truck with diesel or fill up my truck with fuel. When I do that, I pay a tax and then I use the roads. So that seems fairer to people than most taxes, but we haven't had a system that allowed us to make the most of that. In our State, 22 percent of the major roads of Missouri are now considered in poor condition. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives us a C, and this is one of the areas where we would want to be an A. If you are a C instead of an A, the average Missouri motorist pays about $400 more a year in extra maintenance because we are trying to maintain a system that has gotten into poor condition. Some 44 percent of our highways are congested. Congestion costs motorists a lot of money in just wasted fuel. You don't have to spend much time around Washington in a car to realize how much time you can waste in traffic, but we see that happening more and more all over the country. In our State we have more bridges than any other State, and they are in among the worst conditions of the country, with 30 percent of our bridges rated as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. There was just a TIGER grant awarded to replace the Champ Clark Bridge across the Mississippi River, which I believe was built in 1919. If that bridge has to be shut down before it can be replaced or would have been shut down, the detour to get to where that bridge gets you is 75 or 80 miles driving around to where that bridge currently takes people. We have many bridges in our State that are county bridges; they are not State bridges. I have talked to county commissioners, and one of their principal concerns is this: What about the fund that helps us with our off-system bridges? Senator Casey and I created a fund to do this in 2012. We added it to the 2012 highway bill. Since then, it has provided about $775 million annually to States. Out of that State fund, whenever you are part of the off-system road system, the State pays 85 percent of a bridge that the county otherwise in most cases wouldn't be able to replace. We have one county that I think [[Page S82]] has 4,000 people and 40 bridges. That is a lot of bridges for 4,000 people to try to be responsible for. It is our smallest county, and that is maybe a different debate, but they have 40 bridges. We have many bridges in our State. The county road-county bridge system has about 50 percent of all the bridges we have in Missouri. The bridge system and the highway system are critical to us if we want to compete. As the middle of the country grows things and makes things, it is a great opportunity for us to get things--not just onto the river system and onto the railway system--all over the country and all other the world. Transportation really matters. The FAST Act--and I have a hard time saying the FAST Act without thinking how slow the FAST Act really was in getting passed--creates two freight-based programs that allows States to compete for funding for major projects. In a world where we want to compete, we need to figure out how we can compete more effectively. How do you get things to places where they are made into products? How do you get things that are grown and need to be shipped to places? How do you get them to places in a better way? In the life of this bill, the State of Missouri should receive about $150 million to look at those freight projects because those projects and the effective use of how you get things to places create jobs. The Missouri Department of Transportation has already developed a State freight plan to encourage strategies. Now this bill makes that plan more of a reality. The FAST Act also includes some help for our Nation's rail systems. I had a bill, the Track, Railroad, and Infrastructure Network Act, that when you are improving a railroad system, it allows you to have the same kind of streamlining that we were recently able to provide for highway construction. You don't get caught up on something that has to be needlessly litigated for long periods of time when, in fact, what you really need to be doing is getting that highway finished in the highway part of this bill or have the expedited ability for these issues to go to the top of the list and to get resolved so that people can get the things they make where they want to get them. They can get the things they buy quicker than they would get them otherwise. They can get to work, they can get to school, and they can get to the hospital when somebody is sick. I mentioned that, particularly because we just had floods in our State in the last few days. For a while, Interstate 70, Interstate 44, and Interstate 55--all three--were closed. There was a time when two of those were closed at the same time. They were closed for 24 to 36 hours, and it makes a difference in how people are able to live their lives. The Federal Permitting Improvement Act that I cosponsored was also included in the bill. This is a piece of legislation that Senator Portman and Senator McCaskill introduced. It will now allow better coordination between the deadline setting for permitting decisions--the same kind of thing for highways that we are also doing for railroads-- to make this important transportation system work. Looking at the United States, Winston Churchill once said we were the best located country in the world--an ocean on either side and neighbors that we could deal with north and south. And the ability to get anywhere would be another addition to that location advantage we have. The FAST Act includes two important provisions to give relief to electricity providers. One is a law that creates emergency route working groups for electricity and other things. If you have a vehicle that needs to get from Oklahoma to Joplin, MO, after the tornado, you don't have to get it especially permitted and authorized to come across that State line in what has been declared an emergency. The same thing would have happened in recent days in several places in our State close to a border, close to the equipment they need. The flood means there is an emergency. Now those vehicles can cross the State line without having to have the special permission that needed to be received in the past. Secondly, the Grid Reliability Act that I introduced with my Missouri colleague Senator McCaskill simply improves reliability. If you have two conflicting Federal agencies--one saying you can only use that plant so much of the time and another saying we have an electric emergency--you have to use every facility you have to provide the electricity that is needed, and that can now be done. There are many committees of jurisdiction here. The commerce committee that I am a member of is certainly the committee that is focused on infrastructure, focused on ports and other things that I haven't mentioned a lot but that are very important. I have mentioned at other times on the floor of the Senate that this is one of the great accomplishments of the first year of this Congress that may easily go overlooked, but I can tell you that county officials all over America and State legislative bodies all over America are looking at this bill and figuring out how do we use this as a way to move our transportation system into the 21st century, how do we use this to help provide opportunity, and how do we use this to help provide the kinds of jobs that provide the kind of pay that families need to live on and to live the kinds of lives they would like to live. I look forward to seeing this bill implemented. I think all of us need to watch carefully to be sure that we are making the most of one of the responsibilities of government. Defending the country and having a transportation system that works are both things that individuals and families can't do for themselves. I believe the FAST Act gives us a better chance than we have had since 2009 to look at the future with a greater degree of certainty and to work in an area that is critically important for the country but even more important for Missouri and others who live in the middle of these transportation networks, where they come together. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S81-S82] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAST ACT Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk about something that was overlooked late in the year as we passed the surface transportation bill--the highway bill. It was called the Fix America's Surface Transportation Act or the FAST Act. It wasn't very fast. I am glad to see the President signed the law last month. It is one of the things people understand they can't do for themselves--along with defending the country--having a transportation system that works and taking advantage of who we are as a nation, being strategically located in as fine a place as you can be to do business, to create jobs and opportunity all over the world. The FAST Act in my State would provide $5 billion to Missouri over the next 5 years to improve our roads, bridges, and rail system. That is the amount of money we will send in over the next 5 years. We are either slightly a donee State or slightly a donor State. We might be better off if we kept all the money, but that is not what is happening right now. We are certainly better off if we know what the highway program looks like for 5 years. An effective transportation plan is good for the country, but it is particularly good where I live. If you look at any map of the river structure of the country or any railroad map of the country or any highway map of the country, a significant part of coming together of all three of those--rail, water, and highways--all happens right where we live. Because we are the hub of the railway, highway, and water systems, it is very important that we have a system that makes the most of that where we live. When I had a chance to speak to the Missouri House of Representatives in Jefferson City over the first week of the year, I told the Missouri General Assembly that this is a competitive advantage for us, but we need to make the most of it.

gives us a better chance than we have had since 2009 to look at the future with a greater degree of certainty and to work in an area that is critically important for the country but even more important for missouri and others who live in the middle of these transportation networks, where they come together. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. grassley. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the

Mr. President, have you ever flown a drone? It used to be that you had to fly helicopters or it used to be that you would fly what we call unmanned aerial vehicles, the ones that have been so helpful to us in the war against terror. That would usually be an Air Force pilot. But now people can go to Best Buy or to Walgreens or to the hobby shop and buy a drone this big. If it is an older model, it would cost $100. If it is a newer model, it would cost $500. People can have a lot of fun. As a matter of fact, I can't wait until they finish development of the drones they are testing right now that I can sit on, and then I can go from point A to point B and avoid the red lights and the traffic jams and so forth. Along with this new technology comes some, certainly, new challenges. So as our commerce committee is approaching work on the FAA bill, the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization--otherwise, in a couple of months that authorization law expires--we are going to have to address the issue of drones because we have had now a number of near misses of drones. A study in December came out: 241 near misses. As a matter of fact, the New York area airports clearly had the most with, in this study period, 86, but my State of Florida had both Miami and Orlando with a substantial number. At most of the major metropolitan area airports across the entire country--Los Angeles, 39 near misses, and Chicago and Boston; we can go over the entire country--there is a substantial number. Another report that came out just at the end of last year pointed out that just in September there were 122 incidents and just in October there were 137 incidents. If a seagull sucked into the jet engines of US Airways could cause the complete loss of power so that Captain Sully Sullenberger--since he couldn't get to an emergency landing in a field--had to put it down in the Hudson River, and if a seagull with flesh and blood and seagull bones and webbed feet sucked into the engines can stall out a jet engine, we can imagine what a drone that you buy at Best Buy this big made of plastic, but with metal parts such as the camera, what that would do, and it is just a matter of time, unless we take action. [[Page S81]] Now, I have a picture here. I would like to zero-in on this. This is a drone, the size that I just showed with my arms, flying past a palm tree in my State of Florida. But if that drone goes higher--higher than the FAA limit right now of 400 feet--and gets into the flightpath of an incoming airliner or one that is outbound, then we have a major disaster on our hands. We want creativity. We want inventiveness. This is a new technology and it is great. Look at what we can do now with aerial photography so we don't have to rent an airplane. Look, however, how it is being used. Did my colleagues know drones are being used to go over a prison wall and deliver contraband? How about the reverse: Getting messages out? So, obviously, the government is going to have to get into it one way or another. Now, one thing that we could do with this technology is we could require the software to be put in these drones that would prohibit it from getting close to an airport. There is that kind of technology. I suppose we could put the software in it that would prohibit it from getting above a certain altitude. But the question is this: When somebody breaks those limits, how do we go about identifying them? Should there be some kind of registration number? Should there, in fact, even be licensure? We probably don't have to worry about commercial uses such as aerial photography because those users are going to be very careful. However, for the hobbyist or the kid who can now go and purchase a drone, we see the probabilities of an accident waiting to happen. Now, I don't have the answer. But in the next two months, as we are getting ready on the FAA bill, we are going to have to come up with some answers. So I raise this issue for the Senate. It is a real problem. We have to face it. We have to address it. We have to prevent these kinds of terrible accidents that can occur if we do nothing. I intend to do something on the commerce committee. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CREC-2016-01-19-pt1-PgS82,CREC-2016-01-19,114,AMERICAN SAFE ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S82-S83] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN SAFE ACT Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on a motion to proceed to H.R. 4038, also known as the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act. This bill would prohibit the admission into the United States of refugees from Iraq or Syria or any other refugee who has been present in those countries in the last 5 years unless that person receives a thorough background investigation. The bill would require the Director of the FBI to certify to the Secretary of Homeland Security and also to the Director of National Intelligence that each of those persons has received a background investigation that is sufficient to determine whether he or she is a threat to the security of the United States. Then, as a second provision, the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the Director of the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence, would have to certify to Congress that each refugee is not a security threat; and finally, it requires the Homeland Security inspector general to conduct a risk-based review of all certifications for the admission of Iraqi and Syrian refugees made by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Director of National Intelligence each year and provide an annual report to the Congress. This bill passed the House overwhelmingly and in a bipartisan manner in November. I intend to vote on the motion to proceed tomorrow. This is a conversation we need to have in the Senate. This is not an issue we can take lightly, despite the plea from President Obama in his State of the Union Address. We cannot allow America's welcome mat to become a doormat for radicalized Islamic extremists who are hardwired to kill innocent people and destroy our way of life. Unless and until the United States can figure out a foolproof screening process to prevent terrorists from masquerading as refugees to infiltrate our neighborhoods and our communities, President Obama needs to listen [[Page S83]] to the concerns voiced by more than half of the Nation's Governors, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on both sides of Capitol Hill, and the American people from across the entire country. After the September 11 attacks, we paused our refugee admission program to reassess its security vetting procedures, so there is precedent for suspending the refugee program, and this bill does not suspend the refugee program--only in regard to the single instance that I know; that is, we have been threatened that people were going to be snuck into the country under the umbrella of refugee, and of course that is from Iraq and Syria. We need to move cautiously in accepting refugees from Iraq and Syria given the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, CA, and even elsewhere around the world. We need to fully understand the risks and the schemes that these terrorists are using before we open our doors to 10,000 more Syrians. Other countries face the same challenge. Just last week, the French Interior Minister warned his colleagues about the intent of the Islamic State to use authentic-looking Syrian and Iraqi passports to smuggle its operatives into Europe. There is no doubt that the group has obtained thousands of blank passports and intends to facilitate travel by counterfeiting those documents, but more importantly, we must consider a pause in accepting these refugees until we can be sure our background checks and investigations are the best they can be. However, today there is little doubt, even from our leading intelligence officials that we may not be able to stop a Paris- like attack because we cannot tell who among the thousands of Syrian refugees that the administration wishes to resettle here are terrorists. The Director of the FBI, James Comey, said: ``My concern is that there are certain gaps . . . in the data available to us'' in screening Syrian refugees. This data, such as fingerprints, background or biographic information, is crucial for adequate screening of potential refugees entering the United States. Director Comey also said: ``There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that.'' The United States has been successful in fighting off many large- scale terrorist attacks on our soil, but of course it only takes one mistake. Just last month, the FBI arrested two individuals who reside in the United States and entered the country as refugees, one of whom was arrested for attempting to knowingly and willfully provide material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. A Federal agent testified last week that one of the men charged planned to set off bombs at two Houston malls. I asked for the immigration and criminal histories of these individuals to investigate further and satisfy myself, and I am still waiting for their response. The concerns are real. The threats are real. We cannot jeopardize our national security simply by rolling out our welcome mat to these terrorists. President Obama's lack of strategy in Syria has exacerbated this human catastrophe. Similarly, this administration has no inclination or strategy to create conditions where refugees can one day return home safely to their own homes. By housing these refugees, the United States is only aiding in a short-term treatment of this whole massive refugee problem and the problems of warfare in the Middle East while at the same time risking the safety of the American people. We must instead focus on defeating ISIS and alleviating the current humanitarian misery, all while creating a future for Syrian refugees in their homeland. The No. 1 responsibility of the U.S. Federal Government is to protect the homeland and to secure the country against all threats. Moving this bill on our vote tomorrow is one step we can take to advance this principle and to show our concern that the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government is the defense of the American people.

We need to move cautiously in accepting refugees from Iraq and Syria given the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, CA, and even elsewhere around the world. We need to fully understand the risks and the schemes that these terrorists are using before we open our doors to 10,000 more Syrians. Other countries face the same challenge. Just last week, the French Interior Minister warned his colleagues about the intent of the Islamic State to use authentic-looking Syrian and Iraqi passports to smuggle its operatives into Europe. There is no doubt that the group has obtained thousands of blank passports and intends to facilitate travel by counterfeiting those documents, but more importantly, we must consider a pause in accepting these refugees until we can be sure our background checks and investigations are the best they can be. However, today there is little doubt, even from our leading intelligence officials that we may not be able to stop a Paris- like attack because we cannot tell who among the thousands of Syrian refugees that the administration wishes to resettle here are terrorists. The Director of the FBI, James Comey, said: ``My concern is that there are certain gaps . . . in the data available to us'' in screening Syrian refugees. This data, such as fingerprints, background or biographic information, is crucial for adequate screening of potential refugees entering the United States. Director Comey also said: ``There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that.'' The United States has been successful in fighting off many large- scale terrorist attacks on our soil, but of course it only takes one mistake. Just last month, the FBI arrested two individuals who reside in the United States and entered the country as refugees, one of whom was arrested for attempting to knowingly and willfully provide material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. A Federal agent testified last week that one of the men charged planned to set off bombs at two Houston malls. I asked for the immigration and criminal histories of these individuals to investigate further and satisfy myself, and I am still waiting for their response. The concerns are real. The threats are real. We cannot jeopardize our national security simply by rolling out our welcome mat to these terrorists. President Obama's lack of strategy in Syria has exacerbated this human catastrophe. Similarly, this administration has no inclination or strategy to create conditions where refugees can one day return home safely to their own homes. By housing these refugees, the United States is only aiding in a short-term treatment of this whole massive refugee problem and the problems of warfare in the Middle East while at the same time risking the safety of the American people. We must instead focus on defeating ISIS and alleviating the current humanitarian misery, all while creating a future for Syrian refugees in their homeland. The No. 1 responsibility of the U.S. Federal Government is to protect the homeland and to secure the country against all threats. Moving this bill on our vote tomorrow is one step we can take to advance this principle and to show our concern that the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government is the defense of the American people. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

and finally, it requires the homeland security inspector general to conduct a risk-based review of all certifications for the admission of iraqi and syrian refugees made by the department of homeland security, the fbi, and the director of national intelligence each year and provide an annual report to the congress. this bill passed the house overwhelmingly and in a bipartisan manner in november. i intend to vote on the motion to proceed tomorrow. this is a conversation we need to have in the senate. this is not an issue we can take lightly, despite the plea from president obama in his state of the union address. we cannot allow america's welcome mat to become a doormat for radicalized islamic extremists who are hardwired to kill innocent people and destroy our way of life. unless and until the united states can figure out a foolproof screening process to prevent terrorists from masquerading as refugees to infiltrate our neighborhoods and our communities, president obama needs to listen [[page s83]] to the concerns voiced by more than half of the nation's governors, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on both sides of capitol hill, and the american people from across the entire country. after the september 11 attacks, we paused our refugee admission program to reassess its security vetting procedures, so there is precedent for suspending the refugee program, and this bill does not suspend the refugee program--only in regard to the single instance that i know;

Mr. President, I rise today to honor U.S. Air Force Maj. Adrianna Vorderbruggen, who was tragically killed in the line of duty 4 days before Christmas when a Taliban suicide bomber rammed his motorcycle carrying explosives into a joint NATO-Afghan patrol near Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. She was the highest ranking military officer there who was killed. There were several others who tragically lost their lives as well. Today I had the honor of attending the major's funeral service at the Fort Myer Memorial Chapel. Senator Franken was also there. She was laid to rest with full military honors at the Arlington National Cemetery. She is survived by her wife Heather, her son Jacob, her father Joseph, and her brothers, Dan, John, and Chris. I will [[Page S84]] note that three of the four members of the family--since I was just talking about adoption--were, in fact, adopted. Adrianna was a native of my hometown of Plymouth, MN, where she attended my alma mater, Wayzata High School. She excelled in both academics and athletics and was a 3-year starter on the Wayzata High School women's soccer team. This is a very large suburban high school. The year she was a starter and captain, she led the team to the State championship. She was also the captain of the Wayzata High School hockey team. She went on to the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado and graduated in 2002. In her senior year, she led the women's rugby team to the national championship title. She was their cocaptain, so you can imagine. She was a starter on the soccer team and helped lead that team in high school to a State championship. She was the captain of the hockey team, which is a big deal in Minnesota, of a big high school, and she was also the cocaptain of the rugby team and helped lead that team to a national championship title in the Air Force. We can imagine the leadership Adrianna had shown through her life. She always loved sports--something that was talked about a lot today by her family. After graduating, she attended the Air Force Special Investigations Academy and was deployed to Iraq until 2005. In 2009 she was selected as an Air Force Institute of Technology student in forensic sciences and earned a master's degree in forensic sciences at George Washington University. In 2010 she became a special agent for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, which investigates felony-level crimes committed by or against Air Force personnel in the United States and overseas. Major Vorderbruggen was also an outspoken opponent to the military's former don't ask, don't tell policy. She and Heather, an Air Force veteran, were among the first servicemembers to marry after the policy was rescinded in 2010. Adrianna chose to serve her country in spite of the military's policy and fought for reform rather than hiding her identity. As her older brother Chris said, ``She inspired us all, I think, by just being herself, and being proud to be who she was.'' Adrianna was known by her family and friends for her positive attitude and her infectious smile. At the service this morning, her dad remembered Adrianna's ability to remain upbeat even under challenging circumstances. And she loved their little boy, Jacob, who was there today with a loving family around him. Major Vorderbruggen will be remembered for the work she did in service to her country and the work she did to make sure all brave men and women in uniform receive the honor and the dignity they so rightfully deserve.

CREC-2016-01-19-pt1-PgS83,CREC-2016-01-19,114,ADOPTEE CITIZENSHIP ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S83] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADOPTEE CITIZENSHIP ACT Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Adoptee Citizenship Act, legislation that will secure citizenship for adopted children. I wish to thank Senator Coats for cosponsoring the bill with me, along with Senator Merkley, and Senator Gillibrand is also a cosponsor. The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 guaranteed citizenship to most international adoptees. This was very important because sometimes children have been adopted, they come over to live in this country for years, and, in fact, for some reason--the paperwork wasn't filed--they do not actually have their citizenship. The problem with that law back in 2000 was that it did not apply to adoptees who were over 18 at the time the bill was passed. I am sure there were some reasons for that, but it really makes no sense because a kid who was 17 at the time and had been legally adopted was no different from a child who was 19 at the time who had been legally adopted. What our bill does is very limited. It fixes that. The loophole denies some adult adoptees the right to citizenship even though they were legally adopted by U.S. citizens and raised in the United States. They are over 18, so they have for the most part lived in the United States for a very long period of time. In fact, they were over 18 back in the year 2000. The bipartisan Adoptee Citizenship Act would fix this problem by giving citizenship to international adoptees--people who were legally adopted, who were 18 in the year 2000 or older--regardless of how old they were when the Child Citizenship Act passed. These adoptees grew up in American families, they went to American schools, they lead American lives, yet adopted children who are not covered by the Child Citizenship Act are not guaranteed citizenship. Because of their lack of citizenship, adoptees have been refused admission to college and turned down for jobs. This constant threat to the life they know is unjust, and this bill would simply ensure that international adoptees are recognized as the Americans they truly are. The bill is especially important in my home State of Minnesota. Many people don't know this, but Minnesota actually has one of the highest rates of international adoption in the country. Minnesota families have opened their homes and their hearts to children from all over the world--from Vietnam, to Guatemala, to Nepal, to Haiti. As cochair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support adoptive families and children. Our children--all kids--deserve so much more than a roof over their heads and a bed to sleep in. Each and every child deserves a loving home, a nurturing family, and a brighter future. That is what this bill is all about. It fixes something. It closes a loophole. It has bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to consider voting for it. There is obviously a lot of interest from adoptees all across the country who have been living with this, through no fault of their own, for years and years and years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S83] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADOPTEE CITIZENSHIP ACT Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

That is what this bill is all about. It fixes something. It closes a loophole. It has bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to consider voting for it. There is obviously a lot of interest from adoptees all across the country who have been living with this, through no fault of their own, for years and years and years. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S83] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADOPTEE CITIZENSHIP ACT Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Adoptee Citizenship Act, legislation that will secure citizenship for adopted children. I wish to thank Senator Coats for cosponsoring the bill with me, along with Senator Merkley, and Senator Gillibrand is also a cosponsor. The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 guaranteed citizenship to most international adoptees. This was very important because sometimes children have been adopted, they come over to live in this country for years, and, in fact, for some reason--the paperwork wasn't filed--they do not actually have their citizenship. The problem with that law back in 2000 was that it did not apply to adoptees who were over 18 at the time the bill was passed. I am sure there were some reasons for that, but it really makes no sense because a kid who was 17 at the time and had been legally adopted was no different from a child who was 19 at the time who had been legally adopted. What our bill does is very limited. It fixes that. The loophole denies some adult adoptees the right to citizenship even though they were legally adopted by U.S. citizens and raised in the United States. They are over 18, so they have for the most part lived in the United States for a very long period of time. In fact, they were over 18 back in the year 2000. The bipartisan Adoptee Citizenship Act would fix this problem by giving citizenship to international adoptees--people who were legally adopted, who were 18 in the year 2000 or older--regardless of how old they were when the Child Citizenship Act passed. These adoptees grew up in American families, they went to American schools, they lead American lives, yet adopted children who are not covered by the Child Citizenship Act are not guaranteed citizenship. Because of their lack of citizenship, adoptees have been refused admission to college and turned down for jobs. This constant threat to the life they know is unjust, and this bill would simply ensure that international adoptees are recognized as the Americans they truly are. The bill is especially important in my home State of Minnesota. Many people don't know this, but Minnesota actually has one of the highest rates of international adoption in the country. Minnesota families have opened their homes and their hearts to children from all over the world--from Vietnam, to Guatemala, to Nepal, to Haiti. As cochair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support adoptive families and children. Our children--all kids--deserve so much more than a roof over their heads and a bed to sleep in. Each and every child deserves a loving home, a nurturing family, and a brighter future. That is what this bill is all about. It fixes something. It closes a loophole. It has bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to consider voting for it.

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Wilhelmina Marie Wright, of Minnesota, to be United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 minutes of debate. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of Justice Wilhelmina Wright's confirmation as a district court judge for the District of Minnesota. Justice Wright, as the members of the Judiciary Committee learned during her fine hearing, is a dedicated public servant with a distinguished career spanning the State and Federal legal system. She is the first person in the history of Minnesota to serve at all three levels of the judiciary and receive this nomination. She served as a district court judge in Minnesota, she served for the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and she now serves on the Minnesota Supreme Court. Her 15 years of judicial experience make her ready to do this job on day one, and I can state that when you hear the statistics about the overload for the District of Minnesota, we need her to start tomorrow on day one. Her qualifications are impeccable. Justice Wright has sat on panels deciding over 2,000 cases and presided over nearly 700. Yet with all those cases and all these opinions, there were no serious questions raised at all about her being biased or unfair in some way in her work as a judge. In fact, it was the opposite. She has the support of former Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican, and many others in our State who have served across the aisle. Her qualifications reveal a thoughtful and a talented jurist, one who applies the law to the facts of each case. Justice Wright currently serves as associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, a position she has had since her appointment in 2012. As the first African-American woman to serve on the court, Justice Wright has earned the respect of litigants, lawyers, and judicial colleagues alike. Justice Wright was born in Norfolk, VA. She graduated from Yale College cum laude in 1986 and received her law degree from Harvard Law School in 1989. After law school, Justice Wright clerked for Judge Damon Keith of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. She then went into private practice for 5 years at Hogan & Hartson. Before long she felt the pull of public service. She joined the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota and has been a dependable and dedicated leader of the Minnesota legal system ever since that time. During her time as a Federal prosecutor, she received the U.S. Department of Justice Director's Award and the Department's Special Achievement Award. If you look at her path before she became a judge, every step of the way she excelled. She excelled growing up. She excelled in college and law school in terms of her record. She excelled as a judicial clerk, she excelled in private practice, and she excelled in the U.S. attorney's office, where she received numerous awards. She was then appointed by, I believe, Gov. Jesse Ventura. She did not start her career as a political appointee. He was in the Independent Party. She served as a Ramsey County district court judge from 2000 to 2002, when she was appointed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. She served for 10 years until her most recent appointment to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Justice Wright is also involved in a variety of civic and bar activities. She devotes 50 hours per year to educating the public on the law. If that is not enough, Justice Wright has also worked to improve the legal system. She has been a member of the Minnesota Judicial Council, the Minnesota Courts Public Trust and Confidence Working Group, and the Minnesota State Bar Association Task Force on the Minnesota Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct. In 2006, the Minnesota Women Lawyers honored her with the Myra Bradwell Award for her service, and in 2012 the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers presented her with the President's Award. The law has always been more than a profession for Justice Wright. It has been central to her own development. Growing up, she watched her parents fight the Norfolk, VA, school system to ensure her access to the same educational opportunities as everyone else. The protections enforced by the legal system were crucial to her family's struggle. As Justice Wright has said about the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education: ``Aside from the Bible, that court order was the most important written document in my family's life.'' [[Page S85]] The law worked for Justice Wright. In turn, she has dedicated her own life to the law and to fairness and impartiality. Justice Wright deserves to be confirmed. As I said, the Judiciary Committee hearing went extremely well. She has the support of many members of the committee. In fact, her nomination went through without an objection when we had the vote. She explained any questions that the members of the Judiciary Committee had--and there were some, obviously. A very good Senator asked a lot of questions on the committee. She explained any question they had about past legal writings from law school and other issues. They felt secure in her nomination and passed her out of committee without any objection. No new issues have been raised since that time. There were no serious questions about the 2,300 cases she handled. I can't think of many nominees we have had with that kind of record. I would add that this nomination is particularly important to the District of Minnesota. The U.S. Judicial Conference has deemed the current vacancy in our State to be a judicial emergency. Our district caseload has increased significantly in recent years. In 2014, the district saw a 57-percent jump in case filings, with nearly 6,000 Federal cases currently pending. Judge Davis assumed senior status last August, vacating the position for which she has been nominated. Failing to fill this judicial vacancy is failing the people of Minnesota. I am so proud of my colleagues and thank them for their support, both Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who will be voting for her today. Justice Wright is the type of nominee we strive for--the best candidate for the job. We had a bipartisan committee led by two private practice lawyers, one having served as U.S. attorney for the State of Minnesota under the first President Bush and the second President Bush, Tom Heffelfinger. He chaired this committee which looked at so many qualified nominees and made this recommendation to Senator Franken and myself. So this process from the beginning has been completely bipartisan and impeccable and we are proud of that process. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Justice Wright as ``well qualified'' to serve as a district court judge for the District of Minnesota, which is the highest rating the committee awards. It is based on a confidential peer review of Justice Wright's professional competence, integrity, and judicial temperament. As Senator Coleman, a former Senator from the State of Minnesota, a Republican Senator, said: ``I fully support her nomination and have communicated that to my former colleagues.'' Why does Senator Coleman support this nomination? Because he looked at the record of a woman of integrity, a woman who had not one case questioned before the very thorough Judiciary Committee, who has the support of many of the Republican Senators--no objections raised when the vote was taken. This is exactly the kind of nominee we want. Justice Wilhelmina Wright will make a fine Federal district court judge for the District of Minnesota. I urge all my colleagues to support this superb nominee. The people of Minnesota need and deserve a judge of Wilhelmina Wright's caliber. We are proud of our Federal judges in Minnesota. Some came from Democratic administrations, some came out of Republican administrations, but they have always had the reputation of integrity. Justice Wright will continue to uphold that reputation of integrity. I ask my colleagues to support her. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. I also see that my colleague Senator Franken is here as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the senior Senator from Minnesota for her remarks about Wilhelmina Wright. I join her in rising not just in strong support but enthusiastic support for Justice Wilhelmina Wright's nomination to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. We call her Justice Wright because she is on the Minnesota Supreme Court. She has been an excellent consensus nominee. I would like to thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for working to ensure that the Judiciary Committee reported out her nomination favorably. I would also like to thank Leader McConnell for scheduling this afternoon's vote. As of today, Justice Wright's nomination has been pending for 279 days--more than 9 months. The seat she has been nominated to fill has been declared a judicial emergency. So I am pleased the Senate is moving to confirm Justice Wright and that Minnesotans seeking justice will soon be able to have their day in court. Justice Wright is, without question, the best candidate for this position. Not only did she earn a stellar reputation as a Federal prosecutor in Minnesota, but Justice Wright is the only person in our State's history to serve as a judge at all three levels of Minnesota's judiciary. In her 15 years on the bench, Justice Wright has heard more than 2,000 cases, and none of her rulings in those cases raised concern during her hearing, which is why her nomination was approved without objection by the Judiciary Committee in September. For those who have known her, this comes as no surprise. Justice Wright understands the role of a judge. Her unwavering commitment to fairness and impartiality, as well as her reputation for professionalism, explains why Justice Wright enjoys a deep well of support in Minnesota from both sides of the aisle, and I emphasize that. Senator Klobuchar and I formed a bipartisan selection committee to assist us in identifying a nominee for this vacancy. That committee was cochaired by Tom Heffelfinger, a Republican former U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. They are two different people, H.W. and W. Bush, both Presidents. In recommending Justice Wright to Senator Klobuchar and to me, Mr. Heffelfinger said that her nomination ``continues the long Minnesota tradition of selecting federal judges based on their professionalism and experience, rather than political connections. Justice Wright embodies everything one could look for in a federal judge: experience, intellectual firepower, a calm and patient demeanor, and a deep personal understanding of the issues facing the people of this country.'' I think everybody on that panel absolutely agreed with Tom Heffelfinger, who is a great public servant. If Tom Heffelfinger, who is a great public figure himself, says those words, they are high praise indeed. And it was echoed by other conservative voices before Justice Wright's hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Chairman Grassley noted that several Republicans had called him to voice support for her nomination. One of those calls came from my colleague in the House, Representative Erik Paulsen, who represents Minnesota's Third District. It is clear to me why the people of my State, regardless of their political persuasion, support her nomination. Justice Wright's integrity, her dedication to public service, and her commitment to equal justice reflect Minnesota values. I strongly urge that all of my colleagues support Wilhelmina Wright, and I look forward to her confirmation. This is very important. We have other judges who are up for confirmation who come from States such as Iowa and Nebraska. They have been signed off by both of their Senators, including the Presiding Officer. This is a bipartisan commission with bipartisan support, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for Justice Wilhelmina Wright, who now sits on the Minnesota Supreme Court, to sit on the Federal district court. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, our Nation celebrated the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He is a hero to millions of Americans for [[Page S86]] helping to break down racial barriers in this country. It is fitting that today the Senate is turning to a confirmation vote that will increase racial diversity on our Federal bench. Justice Wilhelmina Wright is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. Justice Wright currently serves on the Minnesota Supreme Court. She is the first African- American woman to serve on that court and the first person in Minnesota history to serve as a judge at all three levels of the State judiciary. I commend Senators Klobuchar and Franken for their tireless efforts in helping to move this nomination to a vote. A vote on her nomination is long overdue. Justice Wright was nominated in April 2015, over 9 months ago. She was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote over 4 months ago. After months of needless delay, we could and should have voted to confirm her at the end of the last session. I know Justice Wright will make a superb Federal judge. Since 2012, she has served as an associate justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court. From 2002 to 2012, she served on the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and prior to her tenure on that court, she was the first African-American to serve as a judge on the district court in the second judicial district, Ramsey County, Minnesota, from 2000 to 2002. In her 15-year judicial career, Justice Wright has presided over or served on panels that decided more than 2,000 cases. Prior to her appointment to the bench, she was a Federal prosecutor for the district of Minnesota for 5 years. Justice Wright graduated with her B.A., cum laude, from Yale University and earned her law degree from Harvard Law School. Upon graduating from law school, she clerked for Judge Damon J. Keith on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. With her considerable professional experience, it is no surprise that the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously rated her ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the district court, its highest rating. She also has the enthusiastic support of her home State Senators, Senators Franken and Klobuchar. Based on her wealth of judicial experience and broad support, I cannot think of any good reason why Justice Wright should not be confirmed with an overwhelming vote. After Justice Wright is confirmed, there will be votes under a bipartisan agreement on three other district court nominees--one to the district of New Jersey, one to the southern district of Iowa, and one to the northern district of Iowa. These nominees will be confirmed by President's Day. After we return to session in February, I hope that Republican leadership will continue to schedule nominees for confirmation votes to address the 72 current judicial vacancies that we face today, 32 of which are judicial emergencies. A Politico article last week discussed demands from certain extreme conservative groups for Republican leadership to shut down the confirmation process and block all judicial confirmations for the remainder of the year. I am hopeful that the majority leader will not let moneyed Washington interests decide whether we will uphold our Senatorial oath to provide advice and consent to the President on judicial nominations. Shutting down all judicial confirmations would be a dangerous departure from prior practice. In the last 5 Presidential election years, the Senate has confirmed an average of 30 judicial nominees in the final year prior to Election Day. As both chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have worked with Republicans to confirm judicial nominees, report nominees out of committee, and hold hearings for nominees well into September of Presidential election years. This was the case in 2008, when I was chairman of the committee with a Republican President, and we worked to confirm judicial nominees as late as September of the Presidential election year. In fact, Senate Democrats helped confirm all 10 of President Bush's district court nominees pending on the Senate floor in a single day by unanimous consent on September 26, 2008. This was similarly true in 2004, when I was ranking member of the committee with a Republican President, and we worked to confirm nominees as late as September of the Presidential election year. Any attempt to shut down the judicial confirmation process to satisfy moneyed Washington interests groups would be wrong. It would only work to harm our justice system and the American people we were elected to represent. Outstanding nominees from Tennessee, Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, New York, and California have been pending on the floor for months. Nearly all of them would fill emergency vacancies. Votes on these nominees must be scheduled without further delay. In addition to these pending nominees, there are also four Pennsylvania district court nominees and a Rhode Island nominee that the Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to report out this month. And in committee, nominees from States represented by Republican Senators-- including Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin, and Indiana-- continue to wait for a hearing. It is up to the Senators from those States to urge their leadership to consider these nominees without delay so they can serve the people of those great States. I urge a vote for her confirmation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time on both sides be yielded back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Wilhelmina Marie Wright, of Minnesota, to be United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota? Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Scott). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 36, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 3 Ex.] YEAS--58 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Coats Collins Coons Corker Donnelly Durbin Ernst Feinstein Flake Franken Gillibrand Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Reid Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Vitter Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--36 Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Cassidy Cochran Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Fischer Gardner Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Lankford Lee McCain Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Wicker NOT VOTING--6 Cornyn Cruz Graham Rubio Sanders Scott The nomination was confirmed.

I would also like to thank Leader McConnell for scheduling this afternoon's vote. As of today, Justice Wright's nomination has been pending for 279 days--more than 9 months. The seat she has been nominated to fill has been declared a judicial emergency. So I am pleased the Senate is moving to confirm Justice Wright and that Minnesotans seeking justice will soon be able to have their day in court. Justice Wright is, without question, the best candidate for this position. Not only did she earn a stellar reputation as a Federal prosecutor in Minnesota, but Justice Wright is the only person in our State's history to serve as a judge at all three levels of Minnesota's judiciary. In her 15 years on the bench, Justice Wright has heard more than 2,000 cases, and none of her rulings in those cases raised concern during her hearing, which is why her nomination was approved without objection by the Judiciary Committee in September. For those who have known her, this comes as no surprise. Justice Wright understands the role of a judge. Her unwavering commitment to fairness and impartiality, as well as her reputation for professionalism, explains why Justice Wright enjoys a deep well of support in Minnesota from both sides of the aisle, and I emphasize that. Senator Klobuchar and I formed a bipartisan selection committee to assist us in identifying a nominee for this vacancy. That committee was cochaired by Tom Heffelfinger, a Republican former U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. They are two different people, H.W. and W. Bush, both Presidents. In recommending Justice Wright to Senator Klobuchar and to me, Mr. Heffelfinger said that her nomination ``continues the long Minnesota tradition of selecting federal judges based on their professionalism and experience, rather than political connections. Justice Wright embodies everything one could look for in a federal judge: experience, intellectual firepower, a calm and patient demeanor, and a deep personal understanding of the issues facing the people of this country.'' I think everybody on that panel absolutely agreed with Tom Heffelfinger, who is a great public servant. If Tom Heffelfinger, who is a great public figure himself, says those words, they are high praise indeed. And it was echoed by other conservative voices before Justice Wright's hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Chairman Grassley noted that several Republicans had called him to voice support for her nomination. One of those calls came from my colleague in the House, Representative Erik Paulsen, who represents Minnesota's Third District. It is clear to me why the people of my State, regardless of their political persuasion, support her nomination. Justice Wright's integrity, her dedication to public service, and her commitment to equal justice reflect Minnesota values. I strongly urge that all of my colleagues support Wilhelmina Wright, and I look forward to her confirmation. This is very important. We have other judges who are up for confirmation who come from States such as Iowa and Nebraska. They have been signed off by both of their Senators, including the Presiding Officer. This is a bipartisan commission with bipartisan support, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for Justice Wilhelmina Wright, who now sits on the Minnesota Supreme Court, to sit on the Federal district court. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, our Nation celebrated the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He is a hero to millions of Americans for [[Page S86]] helping to break down racial barriers in this country. It is fitting that today the Senate is turning to a confirmation vote that will increase racial diversity on our Federal bench. Justice Wilhelmina Wright is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. Justice Wright currently serves on the Minnesota Supreme Court. She is the first African- American woman to serve on that court and the first person in Minnesota history to serve as a judge at all three levels of the State judiciary. I commend Senators Klobuchar and Franken for their tireless efforts in helping to move this nomination to a vote. A vote on her nomination is long overdue. Justice Wright was nominated in April 2015, over 9 months ago. She was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote over 4 months ago. After months of needless delay, we could and should have voted to confirm her at the end of the last session. I know Justice Wright will make a superb Federal judge. Since 2012, she has served as an associate justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court. From 2002 to 2012, she served on the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and prior to her tenure on that court, she was the first African-American to serve as a judge on the district court in the second judicial district, Ramsey County, Minnesota, from 2000 to 2002. In her 15-year judicial career, Justice Wright has presided over or served on panels that decided more than 2,000 cases. Prior to her appointment to the bench, she was a Federal prosecutor for the district of Minnesota for 5 years. Justice Wright graduated with her B.A., cum laude, from Yale University and earned her law degree from Harvard Law School. Upon graduating from law school, she clerked for Judge Damon J. Keith on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. With her considerable professional experience, it is no surprise that the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously rated her ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the district court, its highest rating. She also has the enthusiastic support of her home State Senators, Senators Franken and Klobuchar. Based on her wealth of judicial experience and broad support, I cannot think of any good reason why Justice Wright should not be confirmed with an overwhelming vote. After Justice Wright is confirmed, there will be votes under a bipartisan agreement on three other district court nominees--one to the district of New Jersey, one to the southern district of Iowa, and one to the northern district of Iowa. These nominees will be confirmed by President's Day. After we return to session in February, I hope that Republican leadership will continue to schedule nominees for confirmation votes to address the 72 current judicial vacancies that we face today, 32 of which are judicial emergencies. A Politico article last week discussed demands from certain extreme conservative groups for Republican leadership to shut down the confirmation process and block all judicial confirmations for the remainder of the year. I am hopeful that the majority leader will not let moneyed Washington interests decide whether we will uphold our Senatorial oath to provide advice and consent to the President on judicial nominations. Shutting down all judicial confirmations would be a dangerous departure from prior practice. In the last 5 Presidential election years, the Senate has confirmed an average of 30 judicial nominees in the final year prior to Election Day. As both chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have worked with Republicans to confirm judicial nominees, report nominees out of committee, and hold hearings for nominees well into September of Presidential election years. This was the case in 2008, when I was chairman of the committee with a Republican President, and we worked to confirm judicial nominees as late as September of the Presidential election year. In fact, Senate Democrats helped confirm all 10 of President Bush's district court nominees pending on the Senate floor in a single day by unanimous consent on September 26, 2008. This was similarly true in 2004, when I was ranking member of the committee with a Republican President, and we worked to confirm nominees as late as September of the Presidential election year. Any attempt to shut down the judicial confirmation process to satisfy moneyed Washington interests groups would be wrong. It would only work to harm our justice system and the American people we were elected to represent. Outstanding nominees from Tennessee, Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, New York, and California have been pending on the floor for months. Nearly all of them would fill emergency vacancies. Votes on these nominees must be scheduled without further delay. In addition to these pending nominees, there are also four Pennsylvania district court nominees and a Rhode Island nominee that the Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to report out this month. And in committee, nominees from States represented by Republican Senators-- including Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin, and Indiana-- continue to wait for a hearing. It is up to the Senators from those States to urge their leadership to consider these nominees without delay so they can serve the people of those great States. I urge a vote for her confirmation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time on both sides be yielded back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Wilhelmina Marie Wright, of Minnesota, to be United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota? Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Scott).

Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Wilhelmina Marie Wright, of Minnesota, to be United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 minutes of debate. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of Justice Wilhelmina Wright's confirmation as a district court judge for the District of Minnesota. Justice Wright, as the members of the Judiciary Committee learned during her fine hearing, is a dedicated public servant with a distinguished career spanning the State and Federal legal system. She is the first person in the history of Minnesota to serve at all three levels of the judiciary and receive this nomination. She served as a district court judge in Minnesota, she served for the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and she now serves on the Minnesota Supreme Court. Her 15 years of judicial experience make her ready to do this job on day one, and I can state that when you hear the statistics about the overload for the District of Minnesota, we need her to start tomorrow on day one. Her qualifications are impeccable. Justice Wright has sat on panels deciding over 2,000 cases and presided over nearly 700. Yet with all those cases and all these opinions, there were no serious questions raised at all about her being biased or unfair in some way in her work as a judge. In fact, it was the opposite. She has the support of former Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican, and many others in our State who have served across the aisle. Her qualifications reveal a thoughtful and a talented jurist, one who applies the law to the facts of each case. Justice Wright currently serves as associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, a position she has had since her appointment in 2012. As the first African-American woman to serve on the court, Justice Wright has earned the respect of litigants, lawyers, and judicial colleagues alike. Justice Wright was born in Norfolk, VA. She graduated from Yale College cum laude in 1986 and received her law degree from Harvard Law School in 1989. After law school, Justice Wright clerked for Judge Damon Keith of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. She then went into private practice for 5 years at Hogan & Hartson. Before long she felt the pull of public service. She joined the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota and has been a dependable and dedicated leader of the Minnesota legal system ever since that time. During her time as a Federal prosecutor, she received the U.S. Department of Justice Director's Award and the Department's Special Achievement Award. If you look at her path before she became a judge, every step of the way she excelled. She excelled growing up. She excelled in college and law school in terms of her record. She excelled as a judicial clerk, she excelled in private practice, and she excelled in the U.S. attorney's office, where she received numerous awards. She was then appointed by, I believe, Gov. Jesse Ventura. She did not start her career as a political appointee. He was in the Independent Party. She served as a Ramsey County district court judge from 2000 to 2002, when she was appointed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. She served for 10 years until her most recent appointment to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Justice Wright is also involved in a variety of civic and bar activities. She devotes 50 hours per year to educating the public on the law. If that is not enough, Justice Wright has also worked to improve the legal system. She has been a member of the Minnesota Judicial Council, the Minnesota Courts Public Trust and Confidence Working Group, and the Minnesota State Bar Association Task Force on the Minnesota Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct. In 2006, the Minnesota Women Lawyers honored her with the Myra Bradwell Award for her service, and in 2012 the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers presented her with the President's Award. The law has always been more than a profession for Justice Wright. It has been central to her own development. Growing up, she watched her parents fight the Norfolk, VA, school system to ensure her access to the same educational opportunities as everyone else. The protections enforced by the legal system were crucial to her family's struggle. As Justice Wright has said about the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education: ``Aside from the Bible, that court order was the most important written document in my family's life.'' [[Page S85]] The law worked for Justice Wright. In turn, she has dedicated her own life to the law and to fairness and impartiality. Justice Wright deserves to be confirmed. As I said, the Judiciary Committee hearing went extremely well. She has the support of many members of the committee. In fact, her nomination went through without an objection when we had the vote. She explained any questions that the members of the Judiciary Committee had--and there were some, obviously. A very good Senator asked a lot of questions on the committee. She explained any question they had about past legal writings from law school and other issues. They felt secure in her nomination and passed her out of committee without any objection. No new issues have been raised since that time. There were no serious questions about the 2,300 cases she handled. I can't think of many nominees we have had with that kind of record. I would add that this nomination is particularly important to the District of Minnesota. The U.S. Judicial Conference has deemed the current vacancy in our State to be a judicial emergency. Our district caseload has increased significantly in recent years. In 2014, the district saw a 57-percent jump in case filings, with nearly 6,000 Federal cases currently pending. Judge Davis assumed senior status last August, vacating the position for which she has been nominated. Failing to fill this judicial vacancy is failing the people of Minnesota. I am so proud of my colleagues and thank them for their support, both Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who will be voting for her today. Justice Wright is the type of nominee we strive for--the best candidate for the job. We had a bipartisan committee led by two private practice lawyers, one having served as U.S. attorney for the State of Minnesota under the first President Bush and the second President Bush, Tom Heffelfinger. He chaired this committee which looked at so many qualified nominees and made this recommendation to Senator Franken and myself. So this process from the beginning has been completely bipartisan and impeccable and we are proud of that process. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Justice Wright as ``well qualified'' to serve as a district court judge for the District of Minnesota, which is the highest rating the committee awards. It is based on a confidential peer review of Justice Wright's professional competence, integrity, and judicial temperament. As Senator Coleman, a former Senator from the State of Minnesota, a Republican Senator, said: ``I fully support her nomination and have communicated that to my former colleagues.'' Why does Senator Coleman support this nomination? Because he looked at the record of a woman of integrity, a woman who had not one case questioned before the very thorough Judiciary Committee, who has the support of many of the Republican Senators--no objections raised when the vote was taken. This is exactly the kind of nominee we want. Justice Wilhelmina Wright will make a fine Federal district court judge for the District of Minnesota. I urge all my colleagues to support this superb nominee. The people of Minnesota need and deserve a judge of Wilhelmina Wright's caliber. We are proud of our Federal judges in Minnesota. Some came from Democratic administrations, some came out of Republican administrations, but they have always had the reputation of integrity. Justice Wright will continue to uphold that reputation of integrity. I ask my colleagues to support her. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. I also see that my colleague Senator Franken is here as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the senior Senator from Minnesota for her remarks about Wilhelmina Wright. I join her in rising not just in strong support but enthusiastic support for Justice Wilhelmina Wright's nomination to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. We call her Justice Wright because she is on the Minnesota Supreme Court. She has been an excellent consensus nominee. I would like to thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for working to ensure that the Judiciary Committee reported out her nomination favorably. I would also like to thank Leader McConnell for scheduling this afternoon's vote. As of today, Justice Wright's nomination has been pending for 279 days--more than 9 months. The seat she has been nominated to fill has been declared a judicial emergency. So I am pleased the Senate is moving to confirm Justice Wright and that Minnesotans seeking justice will soon be able to have their day in court.

committee hearing went extremely well. she has the support of many members of the committee. in fact, her nomination went through without an objection when we had the vote. she explained any questions that the members of the judiciary committee had--and there were some, obviously. a very good senator asked a lot of questions on the committee. she explained any question they had about past legal writings from law school and other issues. they felt secure in her nomination and passed her out of committee without any objection. no new issues have been raised since that time. there were no serious questions about the 2,300 cases she handled. i can't think of many nominees we have had with that kind of record. i would add that this nomination is particularly important to the district of minnesota. the u.s. judicial conference has deemed the current vacancy in our state to be a judicial emergency. our district caseload has increased significantly in recent years. in 2014, the district saw a 57-percent jump in case filings, with nearly 6,000 federal cases currently pending. judge davis assumed senior status last august, vacating the position for which she has been nominated. failing to fill this judicial vacancy is failing the people of minnesota. i am so proud of my colleagues and thank them for their support, both democrats and republicans on the judiciary committee who will be voting for her today. justice wright is the type of nominee we strive for--the best candidate for the job. we had a bipartisan committee led by two private practice lawyers, one having served as u.s. attorney for the state of minnesota under the first president bush and the second president bush, tom heffelfinger. he chaired this committee which looked at so many qualified nominees and made this recommendation to senator franken and myself. so this process from the beginning has been completely bipartisan and impeccable and we are proud of that process. the aba standing committee on the federal judiciary unanimously rated justice wright as ``well qualified'' to serve as a district court judge for the district of minnesota, which is the highest rating the committee awards. it is based on a confidential peer review of justice wright's professional competence, integrity, and judicial temperament. as senator coleman, a former senator from the state of minnesota, a republican senator, said: ``i fully support her nomination and have communicated that to my former colleagues.'' why does senator coleman support this nomination? because he looked at the record of a woman of integrity, a woman who had not one case questioned before the very thorough judiciary committee, who has the support of many of the republican senators--no objections raised when the vote was taken. this is exactly the kind of nominee we want. justice wilhelmina wright will make a fine federal district court judge for the district of minnesota. i urge all my colleagues to support this superb nominee. the people of minnesota need and deserve a judge of wilhelmina wright's caliber. we are proud of our federal judges in minnesota. some came from democratic administrations, some came out of republican administrations, but they have always had the reputation of integrity. justice wright will continue to uphold that reputation of integrity. i ask my colleagues to support her. thank you, mr. president, and i yield the floor. i also see that my colleague senator franken is here as well. the presiding officer. the senator from minnesota. mr. franken. thank you, mr. president. i thank the senior senator from minnesota for her remarks about wilhelmina wright. i join her in rising not just in strong support but enthusiastic support for justice wilhelmina wright's nomination to serve on the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota. we call her justice wright because she is on the minnesota supreme court. she has been an excellent consensus nominee. i would like to thank chairman grassley and ranking member leahy for working to ensure that the judiciary committee reported out her nomination favorably. i would also like to thank leader mcconnell for scheduling this afternoon's vote. as of today, justice wright's nomination has been pending for 279 days--more than 9 months. the seat she has been nominated to fill has been declared a judicial emergency. so i am pleased the senate is moving to confirm justice wright and that minnesotans seeking justice will soon be able to have their day in court. justice wright is, without question, the best candidate for this position. not only did she earn a stellar reputation as a federal prosecutor in minnesota, but justice wright is the only person in our state's history to serve as a judge at all three levels of minnesota's judiciary. in her 15 years on the bench, justice wright has heard more than 2,000 cases, and none of her rulings in those cases raised concern during her hearing, which is why her nomination was approved without objection by the judiciary committee in september. for those who have known her, this comes as no surprise. justice wright understands the role of a judge. her unwavering commitment to fairness and impartiality, as well as her reputation for professionalism, explains why justice wright enjoys a deep well of support in minnesota from both sides of the aisle, and i emphasize that. senator klobuchar and i formed a bipartisan selection committee to assist us in identifying a nominee for this vacancy. that committee was cochaired by tom heffelfinger, a republican former u.s. attorney for the district of minnesota under presidents george h.w. bush and george w. bush. they are two different people, h.w. and w. bush, both presidents. in recommending justice wright to senator klobuchar and to me, mr. heffelfinger said that her nomination ``continues the long minnesota tradition of selecting federal judges based on their professionalism and experience, rather than political connections. justice wright embodies everything one could look for in a federal judge: experience, intellectual firepower, a calm and patient demeanor, and a deep personal understanding of the issues facing the people of this country.'' i think everybody on that panel absolutely agreed with tom heffelfinger, who is a great public servant. if tom heffelfinger, who is a great public figure himself, says those words, they are high praise indeed. and it was echoed by other conservative voices before justice wright's hearing before the judiciary committee. chairman grassley noted that several republicans had called him to voice support for her nomination. one of those calls came from my colleague in the house, representative erik paulsen, who represents minnesota's third district. it is clear to me why the people of my state, regardless of their political persuasion, support her nomination. justice wright's integrity, her dedication to public service, and her commitment to equal justice reflect minnesota values. i strongly urge that all of my colleagues support wilhelmina wright, and i look forward to her confirmation. this is very important. we have other judges who are up for confirmation who come from states such as iowa and nebraska. they have been signed off by both of their senators, including the presiding officer. this is a bipartisan commission with bipartisan support, and i urge all of my colleagues to vote for justice wilhelmina wright, who now sits on the minnesota supreme court, to sit on the federal district court. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. leahy. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. leahy. mr. president, yesterday, our nation celebrated the birthday of dr. martin luther king, jr. he is a hero to millions of americans for [[page s86]] helping to break down racial barriers in this country. it is fitting that today the senate is turning to a confirmation vote that will increase racial diversity on our federal bench. justice wilhelmina wright is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy on the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota. justice wright currently serves on the minnesota supreme court. she is the first african- american woman to serve on that court and the first person in minnesota history to serve as a judge at all three levels of the state judiciary. i commend senators klobuchar and franken for their tireless efforts in helping to move this nomination to a vote. a vote on her nomination is long overdue. justice wright was nominated in april 2015, over 9 months ago. she was reported out of the judiciary committee by unanimous voice vote over 4 months ago. after months of needless delay, we could and should have voted to confirm her at the end of the last session. i know justice wright will make a superb federal judge. since 2012, she has served as an associate justice on the minnesota supreme court. from 2002 to 2012, she served on the minnesota court of appeals, and prior to her tenure on that court, she was the first african-american to serve as a judge on the district court in the second judicial district, ramsey county, minnesota, from 2000 to 2002. in her 15-year judicial career, justice wright has presided over or served on panels that decided more than 2,000 cases. prior to her appointment to the bench, she was a federal prosecutor for the district of minnesota for 5 years. justice wright graduated with her b.a., cum laude, from yale university and earned her law degree from harvard law school. upon graduating from law school, she clerked for judge damon j. keith on the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit. with her considerable professional experience, it is no surprise that the aba standing committee on the federal judiciary has unanimously rated her ``well qualified'' to serve on the district court, its highest rating. she also has the enthusiastic support of her home state senators, senators franken and klobuchar. based on her wealth of judicial experience and broad support, i cannot think of any good reason why justice wright should not be confirmed with an overwhelming vote. after justice wright is confirmed, there will be votes under a bipartisan agreement on three other district court nominees--one to the district of new jersey, one to the southern district of iowa, and one to the northern district of iowa. these nominees will be confirmed by president's day. after we return to session in february, i hope that republican leadership will continue to schedule nominees for confirmation votes to address the 72 current judicial vacancies that we face today, 32 of which are judicial emergencies. a politico article last week discussed demands from certain extreme conservative groups for republican leadership to shut down the confirmation process and block all judicial confirmations for the remainder of the year. i am hopeful that the majority leader will not let moneyed washington interests decide whether we will uphold our senatorial oath to provide advice and consent to the president on judicial nominations. shutting down all judicial confirmations would be a dangerous departure from prior practice. in the last 5 presidential election years, the senate has confirmed an average of 30 judicial nominees in the final year prior to election day. as both chairman and ranking member of the judiciary committee, i have worked with republicans to confirm judicial nominees, report nominees out of committee, and hold hearings for nominees well into september of presidential election years. this was the case in 2008, when i was chairman of the committee with a republican president, and we worked to confirm judicial nominees as late as september of the presidential election year. in fact, senate democrats helped confirm all 10 of president bush's district court nominees pending on the senate floor in a single day by unanimous consent on september 26, 2008. this was similarly true in 2004, when i was ranking member of the committee with a republican president, and we worked to confirm nominees as late as september of the presidential election year. any attempt to shut down the judicial confirmation process to satisfy moneyed washington interests groups would be wrong. it would only work to harm our justice system and the american people we were elected to represent. outstanding nominees from tennessee, maryland, new jersey, nebraska, new york, and california have been pending on the floor for months. nearly all of them would fill emergency vacancies. votes on these nominees must be scheduled without further delay. in addition to these pending nominees, there are also four pennsylvania district court nominees and a rhode island nominee that the senate judiciary committee is poised to report out this month. and in committee, nominees from states represented by republican senators-- including florida, georgia, oklahoma, utah, wisconsin, and indiana-- continue to wait for a hearing. it is up to the senators from those states to urge their leadership to consider these nominees without delay so they can serve the people of those great states. i urge a vote for her confirmation. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that all time on both sides be yielded back. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the question is, will the senate advise and consent to the nomination of wilhelmina marie wright, of minnesota, to be united states district judge for the district of minnesota? mr. alexander. mr. president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk

CREC-2016-01-19-pt1-PgS87-2,CREC-2016-01-19,114,"THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S87-S88] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday Americans once again paused to remember a great and prophetic leader, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Chances are, you heard a snippet yesterday of Dr. King's immortal ``I Have a Dream'' speech. Maybe you heard a tape of Dr. King dreaming of that day when ``my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'' That is the Martin Luther King, Jr., that we like to remember: the dreamer. But Dr. King did more than inspire us. He challenged us. And he challenges us still. Dr. King told us about his dream for America in 1963. He was murdered in 1968. In the 5 years between the March on Washington and his death, Dr. King's mission--and his challenges to us--grew. Like the prophet he was, in his final years, Dr. King spoke more and more frequently and forcefully about injustice. Many of the injustices that Dr. King spoke of remain with us today. Some are even greater today than when Dr. King died. Three years after Dr. King's assassination, the writer Carl Wendell Hines penned a poem which he entitled, ``A Dead Man's Dream.'' These are his words: Now that he is safely dead let us praise him Build monuments to his glory, sing hosannas to his name. Dead men make such convenient heroes. They cannot rise to challenge the images we would fashion from their lives. And besides, it is easier to build monuments than to make a better world. So now that he is safely dead We, with eased consciences, can teach our children that he was a great man, Knowing that the cause for which he lived is still a cause And the dream for which he died is still a dream A dead man's dream. So wrote the poet Carl Wendell Hines 45 years ago. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were two of the most important laws passed in the last century. Dr. King's leadership and the sacrifices of millions of other men and women of good faith who believed in his mission were indispensable to the passage of those two historic laws. But Dr. King knew that civil rights and voting rights were only partial victories without economic justice. As he, himself, said of the now iconic Greensboro lunch counter sit-ins: ``What good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can't afford to buy a hamburger?'' At the end of his life, Dr. King was planning what he called the Poor People's Campaign. He was challenging America to offer greater economic justice and opportunity to poor people of all races and backgrounds. We have much more work to do if we are going to make that part of Dr. King's dream a reality. The Great Recession ended officially in 2009. Economic growth has returned to America. But for African Americans and many other Americans, economic fairness is farther out of reach than it's been in decades. Wall Street has regained all of the value it lost in the Great Recession and then some. But middle-class and working-class Americans haven't recovered from that economic disaster. When you factor in inflation, the average American family hasn't had a raise since 1971, shortly after Dr. King's death. A recent survey shows that 62 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts--and a third of those undersavers have no savings account at all. In 1965, the average CEO was paid 20 times as much as the average worker in his or her--usually his--company. Today the average CEO earns more than 295 times as much as the average worker. The economic disparities are even greater when you factor in race. Think about this: African Americans are almost three times more likely to live in poverty today than White Americans. And the median net worth of White households is 13 times the level for Black households. We have a long way to go to achieve Dr. King's dream of economic justice and fairness in America. We should strengthen the Wall Street reforms that Congress passed to prevent a repeat of the kind of recklessness that caused the Great Recession, not gut those reforms. Dr. King was murdered in Memphis, TN, where he had gone to show support for striking sanitation workers. Two months earlier, two black sanitation workers in Memphis had been crushed to death by faulty equipment. The city's sanitation workers organized a strike for job safety, better pay, and the right to unionize; and Dr. King took on their cause. For years now, the rights of working people to band together and unionize has been under attack--an attack financed by wealthy corporate interests. Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Friedrichs v. California Teachers' Association, which asks the Court to overrule decades of precedent protecting the ability of working people to win fair wages and working conditions through effective unionizing. If we truly believe in the America Martin Luther King gave his life for, we should protect the right of workers to form and join unions, not work to diminish and destroy that right. The words that Dr. King spoke at the 1963 March on Washington have become part of our American creed. But the 1963 March was not the first time that Martin Luther King had spoken to a large crowd in Washington. In 1957, on the third anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic Brown v. Board of Education decision that found segregated, ``separate but equal'' schools to be inherently unequal and unconstitutional, a 29-year-old Martin Luther King spoke in Washington at a rally billed as a Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. For 3 years, Southern States had engaged in what they called ``massive resistance'' to the Supreme Court's ruling. Martin Luther King titled his remarks at the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage Give Us the Ballot. His message was simple: If Congress and other elected officials will not enforce the law of the land, give African Americans the ballot, and ``we will elect legislatures that will.'' Eight years later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. For years, the Voting Rights Act was hailed by both parties as a great achievement. It was repeatedly reauthorized by large, bipartisan majorities in Congress. In 2013, however, a slim conservative majority on the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder by striking down the provision that required certain jurisdictions to preclear any changes to their voting laws with the Department of Justice. If we truly believe in Dr. King's dream for America, let's work together to restore the Voting Rights Act this year. One year to the day before he died, Dr. King delivered a sermon at Riverside Church in New York City that cost him the support of many old political allies. It was a speech condemning America's actions in the war in Vietnam. [[Page S88]] If Dr. King were alive today, I think he would be heartbroken, and he would challenge us to confront the tidal wave of guns that have turned so many American neighborhoods into combat zones. Yes, the Second Amendment speaks of a right to bear arms. But children ought to have a right to play on school playgrounds without getting caught in gang crossfire. Americans ought to be able to go to a movie or to a college lecture or a church Bible study class without risking being killed by someone who is too sick or too dangerous to have a gun but has one anyway. Martin Luther King was taken from us by gun violence. If we truly believe in his dream, let's work together to find ways to keep guns out of the wrong hands. ``It is easier to build monuments than to make a better world.'' That is what the poet said. But people don't elect us to do the easy work. They expect us to do the hard work, the necessary work, of making America better, fairer, and more secure. I ask my colleagues: Let's work together to advance economic justice, protect voting rights, and end the violence that is turning too many American neighborhoods into war zones. In short, let's work together to advance Dr. King's dream. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S87-S88] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

As he, himself, said of the now iconic Greensboro lunch counter sit-ins: ``What good is having the right to sit at a lunch counter if you can't afford to buy a hamburger?'' At the end of his life, Dr. King was planning what he called the Poor People's Campaign. He was challenging America to offer greater economic justice and opportunity to poor people of all races and backgrounds. We have much more work to do if we are going to make that part of Dr. King's dream a reality. The Great Recession ended officially in 2009. Economic growth has returned to America. But for African Americans and many other Americans, economic fairness is farther out of reach than it's been in decades. Wall Street has regained all of the value it lost in the Great Recession and then some. But middle-class and working-class Americans haven't recovered from that economic disaster. When you factor in inflation, the average American family hasn't had a raise since 1971, shortly after Dr. King's death. A recent survey shows that 62 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts--and a third of those undersavers have no savings account at all. In 1965, the average CEO was paid 20 times as much as the average worker in his or her--usually his--company. Today the average CEO earns more than 295 times as much as the average worker. The economic disparities are even greater when you factor in race. Think about this: African Americans are almost three times more likely to live in poverty today than White Americans. And the median net worth of White households is 13 times the level for Black households. We have a long way to go to achieve Dr. King's dream of economic justice and fairness in America. We should strengthen the Wall Street reforms that Congress passed to prevent a repeat of the kind of recklessness that caused the Great Recession, not gut those reforms. Dr. King was murdered in Memphis, TN, where he had gone to show support for striking sanitation workers. Two months earlier, two black sanitation workers in Memphis had been crushed to death by faulty equipment. The city's sanitation workers organized a strike for job safety, better pay, and the right to unionize; and Dr. King took on their cause. For years now, the rights of working people to band together and unionize has been under attack--an attack financed by wealthy corporate interests. Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Friedrichs v. California Teachers' Association, which asks the Court to overrule decades of precedent protecting the ability of working people to win fair wages and working conditions through effective unionizing. If we truly believe in the America Martin Luther King gave his life for, we should protect the right of workers to form and join unions, not work to diminish and destroy that right. The words that Dr. King spoke at the 1963 March on Washington have become part of our American creed. But the 1963 March was not the first time that Martin Luther King had spoken to a large crowd in Washington. In 1957, on the third anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic Brown v. Board of Education decision that found segregated, ``separate but equal'' schools to be inherently unequal and unconstitutional, a 29-year-old Martin Luther King spoke in Washington at a rally billed as a Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. For 3 years, Southern States had engaged in what they called ``massive resistance'' to the Supreme Court's ruling. Martin Luther King titled his remarks at the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage Give Us the Ballot. His message was simple: If Congress and other elected officials will not enforce the law of the land, give African Americans the ballot, and ``we will elect legislatures that will.'' Eight years later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. For years, the Voting Rights Act was hailed by both parties as a great achievement. It was repeatedly reauthorized by large, bipartisan majorities in Congress. In 2013, however, a slim conservative majority on the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder by striking down the provision that required certain jurisdictions to preclear any changes to their voting laws with the Department of Justice. If we truly believe in Dr. King's dream for America, let's work together to restore the Voting Rights Act this year. One year to the day before he died, Dr. King delivered a sermon at Riverside Church in New York City that cost him the support of many old political allies. It was a speech condemning America's actions in the war in Vietnam. [[Page S88]] If Dr. King were alive today, I think he would be heartbroken, and he would challenge us to confront the tidal wave of guns that have turned so many American neighborhoods into combat zones. Yes, the Second Amendment speaks of a right to bear arms. But children ought to have a right to play on school playgrounds without getting caught in gang crossfire. Americans ought to be able to go to a movie or to a college lecture or a church Bible study class without risking being killed by someone who is too sick or too dangerous to have a gun but has one anyway. Martin Luther King was taken from us by gun violence. If we truly believe in his dream, let's work together to find ways to keep guns out of the wrong hands. ``It is easier to build monuments than to make a better world.'' That is what the poet said. But people don't elect us to do the easy work. They expect us to do the hard work, the necessary work, of making America better, fairer, and more secure. I ask my colleagues: Let's work together to advance economic justice, protect voting rights, and end the violence that is turning too many American neighborhoods into war zones. In short, let's work together to advance Dr. King's dream. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S87-S88] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday Americans once again paused to remember a great and prophetic leader, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Chances are, you heard a snippet yesterday of Dr. King's immortal ``I Have a Dream'' speech. Maybe you heard a tape of Dr. King dreaming of that day when ``my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'' That is the Martin Luther King, Jr., that we like to remember: the dreamer. But Dr. King did more than inspire us. He challenged us. And he challenges us still. Dr. King told us about his dream for America in 1963. He was murdered in 1968. In the 5 years between the March on Washington and his death, Dr. King's mission--and his challenges to us--grew. Like the prophet he was, in his final years, Dr. King spoke more and more frequently and forcefully about injustice. Many of the injustices that Dr. King spoke of remain with us today. Some are even greater today than when Dr. King died. Three years after Dr. King's assassination, the writer Carl Wendell Hines penned a poem which he entitled, ``A Dead Man's Dream.'' These are his words: Now that he is safely dead let us praise him Build monuments to his glory, sing hosannas to his name. Dead men make such convenient heroes. They cannot rise to challenge the images we would fashion from their lives. And besides, it is easier to build monuments than to make a better world. So now that he is safely dead We, with eased consciences, can teach our children that he was a great man, Knowing that the cause for which he lived is still a cause And the dream for which he died is still a dream A dead man's dream. So wrote the poet Carl Wendell Hines 45 years ago. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were two of the most important laws passed in the last century. Dr. King's leadership and the sacrifices of millions of other men and women of good faith who believed in his mission were indispensable to the passage of those two historic laws.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Ross Bryant, the director of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, military and veteran services center. It gives me great pleasure to recognize Mr. Bryant who does so much for Nevada's veterans, active military members, and their families pursuing academic degrees. Mr. Bryant served in the U.S. Army for 24 years before beginning his career to help fellow veterans and active servicemembers. He began working at UNLV 14 years ago, starting as commander of the UNLV Army ROTC program. He later took on the position of [[Page S89]] deputy director of the Institute for Security Studies before accepting his current role as director of the military and veteran services center. As director, Mr. Bryant works to help active military members and veterans experience a fluid transition from the battlefield to college life. He also developed numerous university and community outreach programs for UNLV to help active military and veteran students be successful in their academic pursuits. Through his tireless efforts, Mr. Bryant has contributed greatly to UNLV's achievement of being named a military friendly school by GI Jobs for 5 consecutive years, as well as making the Military Advanced Education's list of top military-friendly colleges in 2015. UNLV now educates over 1,475 Active-Duty military members, Reservists, National Guard members, veterans, and their families, in part due to the efforts of Mr. Bryant. I am grateful to have Mr. Bryant working on behalf of Nevada's brave men and women. Through collaborative efforts during the last legislative session, Mr. Bryant was a key contributor in attaining passage of legislation for UNLV to waive fees for Active-Duty military members. The program also reinforces UNLV's presence at Nellis Air Force Base, where a classroom is available for Active-Duty military members and their families to take courses. His efforts have brought southern Nevada's military community the academic support that it deserves. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have had no greater honor than the opportunity to engage with the men and women who served in our Nation's military. I recognize Congress has a responsibility not only to honor the brave individuals who serve our Nation, but to ensure they are cared for when they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. I am grateful to have allies like Mr. Bryant working towards a common goal: fighting to ensure the needs of our veterans and Active-Duty military members are met. Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing Mr. Bryant for all that he does for UNLV's military community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S88-S89] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ROSS BRYANT Mr. HELLER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 125th anniversary of Hecla Mining Company, which is celebrating a remarkable milestone in its long and important history in the State of Idaho. Hecla Mining Company was formed in October of 1891 for the purposes of acquiring and trading mining claims in what was then north Idaho's newly discovered Silver Valley. Mining played an integral role in the settlement of the West and, in particular, north Idaho. The resulting mining boom employed thousands of people living in the region. The Silver Valley has produced more than 1.2 billion ounces of silver. Hecla is now the last of the area's pioneer mining companies and the largest primary silver producer in the United States. Hecla has not just weathered the storms of the last 125 years; rather, it has been shaped by them. The company and its workers' grit and resolve enabled their perseverance through the Panic of 1893, the Great Depression, and two World Wars; and they have had many achievements worthy of reflection. The minerals produced by Hecla played a key role in our Nation's defense and continue to play an integral role in the pursuit of alternative energy sources and other essential uses. Silver is a key ingredient for solar voltaic cells and is important for modern electronic and medical applications. Hecla also advanced techniques that improved mine worker safety and works to deepen its connection with the communities in which it operates, while resolving legacy environmental issues. Additionally, Hecla is currently taking the Lucky Friday mine to 10,000 feet below the surface--opening up more than 20 years of additional resources. The company and its approximately 1,300 workers provide tremendous economic and charitable benefits to communities and our Nation. Hecla's charitable foundation has provided more than $1.5 million in the last 7 years alone in support of education, youth activities, community health, and infrastructure. The company estimates that its Lucky Friday Mine in north Idaho has provided more than $1 billion to the local and State economy in the last 5 years. Hecla's employees support numerous community needs, including serving on school boards and other elected positions, as emergency medical technicians and firemen. Congratulations, Hecla Mining Company and employees, on 125 years of accomplishments. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to strengthening our communities, Idaho, and Nation. I wish you all the best for continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S88] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING HECLA MINING COMPANY Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Albert Matthew Francis Witte, a University of Arkansas professor emeritus, former NCAA president, and World War II bombardier who recently passed away December 23, 2015, at the age of 92. Witte, born in Pittsburgh, PA, enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps in November 1942 after graduating high school. His prominent military career included flying 35 missions with the 15th Air Force in Italy as a second lieutenant bombardier, and he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service. After earning his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Chicago, he went on to the University of Wisconsin School of Law, where he practiced law in Milwaukee. Witte spent the rest of his career at the University of Arkansas School of Law, where he officially retired in 1994, but continued teaching until the fall 2015 semester. ``He taught at the University of Arkansas School of Law for nearly six decades--that's almost two-thirds of the school's 91-year existence,'' Stacy Leeds, the dean of the University of Arkansas School of Law recently said of Witte. His passion for law led to his involvement in many professional related projects, including member of the Fayetteville Planning Commission, member of the Arkansas Bar Association, a legal consultant to the Southern Governor's Conference, and a special assistant Arkansas attorney general, just to name a few. Witte's experiences made him a trusted confidant and consult to many in the University of Arkansas's athletics department as well. Twenty years of service as the university's faculty athletic representative allowed him to work with the Southwest and Southeast Conferences, the College Football Association, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. His NCAA involvement included terms as Division I vice president and the association president in 1989. On behalf of the U.S. Congress, I am privileged to recognize the life of Albert Matthew Francis Witte. As a member of the Greatest Generation, he lived a life of service. He leaves a lasting legacy through his brave military service, countless efforts on behalf of the University of Arkansas, and the knowledge he shared with several generations of attorneys across the Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S88] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS F_____ REMEMBERING AL WITTE Mr. BOOZMAN.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Wendy Damonte for her years of dedication to bringing northern Nevada in- depth news coverage. Wendy was an upstanding member of KTVN's news team for 21 years and an important face in Nevada journalism. While she will be departing from the anchor desk, Wendy's tireless dedication to the Reno community will continue as she embarks on a new journey as vice president of advocacy and community partnership at Renown Health. Wendy joined KTVN's news team in 1994, shortly after graduating from the University of Nevada, Reno with a broadcast journalism degree. Her passion in the newsroom quickly moved her up the ranks and led to her anchoring KTVN's evening news program, as well as reporting on medical information on her ``Health Watch'' segment. As part of KTVN's news team, Wendy went above and beyond in her career to bring Nevadans the most up-to-date and accurate news. Her work in our community is invaluable. Throughout her tenure with KTVN, Wendy covered a variety of stories, including medical breakthroughs in Nevada, breaking news stories, and personal health stories. Specifically, Wendy shared an extremely personal story, covering the challenges her mother faced while fighting breast cancer. Wendy's coverage led to significant legislative changes in the fight against breast cancer. She was a key contributor in helping push legislation in Nevada mandating that doctors inform women about their breast density. As someone whose family has been touched by cancer, I understand the difficulties that come with this terrible disease and am thankful to have people like Wendy working to eradicate cancer and increase awareness. I am pleased to say that I have worked with Wendy to raise awareness of the Breast Density and Mammography Act of 2015. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which similarly requires mammography facilities to include up-to-date information about breast density. Wendy's work has truly touched the lives of many across northern Nevada, and we can't thank her enough. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Wendy for her years with KTVN and for her work to create a healthier northern Nevada. Although her time at KTVN may be coming to an end, her efforts to pursue her goals will continue. I wish her well in all of her future endeavors and at her new position at Renown Health. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S89] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO WENDY DAMONTE Mr. HELLER.

As we begin the new year, I would like to recognize Hanko's Metal Works, Inc., of Berwick, LA as small business of the week. In the midst of economic hardship in 1985, Harry ``Hanko'' Hoffpauir opened Hanko's Metal Works with the goal of creating jobs and spurring economic activity in his community. With 27 years of experience in southern Louisiana's maritime industry, Hoffpauir began building aluminum boats, quickly developing a strong reputation for durability and remarkable craftsmanship. Having started his career as a superintendent overseeing major maritime construction efforts, including building offshore platforms drilling for oil and natural gas, Hanko and his small business were poised for success. Today Hanko's Metal Works, Inc., has grown from an operation of two employees to a team of over 35 individuals serving thousands of customers worldwide. Building upon a reputation for craftsmanship and ingenuity, Hanko's continues to develop innovative products, including developing the first oilfield gauging boats that were used to help in the recovery efforts following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which devastated Louisiana's vulnerable coastal wetlands and the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, Hanko's Metal Work, Inc., has also developed vee barges, as well as high-performance fishing and family boats that are ranked as the best aluminum boats constructed in Louisiana.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the remarkable achievements of George Heartwell who, after 20 years of service to the city of Grand Rapids, 12 of them as mayor, won the city international acclaim for environmental sustainability and artistic creativity. Mayor Heartwell, an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ, has served the citizens of Michigan's second largest city with honor and distinction. A graduate of Michigan's Albion College, Mayor Heartwell served the public in a variety of roles prior to his city hall service. Mayor Heartwell helped Grand Rapidians achieve the American dream through his work as president of Heartwell Mortgage Corporation. Mayor Heartwell led Heartside Ministry, helping the homeless of Grand Rapids, and was also president and CEO of Pilgrim Manor Retirement Community. Mayor Heartwell entered Grand Rapids City Hall in 1992, serving the first of four terms as a city commissioner representing Grand Rapids' Third Ward. He took office as mayor in January of 2004. Under his leadership, the city of Grand Rapids withstood the economic storms rattling the State of Michigan, finding methods to deliver city services in sustainable ways. It is Mayor Heartwell's environmental sustainability efforts which have won the city international awards. During his tenure, city government implemented a variety of environmental measures, including purchase of renewable resource energy, use of alternative fuels in city vehicles, continued attention to water quality in the Grand River, and widespread implementation of energy conservation measures. In January 2007, the United Nations recognized Grand Rapids as a Regional Center of Expertise in Education for Sustainable Development. Thanks to Mayor Heartwell's leadership, Grand Rapids is widely recognized as one of the most sustainable cities in America. In 2010, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave Grand Rapids the Nation's Most Sustainable City award, and in 2012, Mayor Heartwell was given the first place Climate Protection Award by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. More recently, Mayor Heartwell was one of only 20 individuals chosen to serve on President Obama's Task Force for Climate Preparedness and Resilience. Mayor Heartwell has also focused on making Grand Rapids a more socially equitable city. Concurrently, the city has enjoyed a decrease in crime rates and an increase in its economic strength. Grand Rapids is widely recognized for its support of the arts and was recently named as number 20 of the 52 Places to Go in the World in 2016 by the New York Times. It is my great pleasure to congratulate Mayor George Heartwell on the lasting impact he has made throughout his service to his hometown, the city of Grand Rapids. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S89] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO GEORGE HEARTWELL Mr. PETERS.

Paul was a lifelong South Dakotan and dedicated public servant to the citizens of our State. After earning his law degree, Paul began 28 years of public service to the people of South Dakota. We are a better State and a better people because of his hard work and dedication. As an administrative law judge, the deputy commissioner of administration, the director of property taxes and special taxes, the commissioner of Administration, and the secretary of Revenue, he inspired his coworkers with [[Page S90]] his intelligence, his humor, and his tenacity for getting things done. During my 8 years working as Governor of South Dakota, Paul served as commissioner of the Bureau of Administration and secretary of Revenue. He was a burly teddy bear of a man. No matter how hard the problem or how challenging the issue, whenever we met, he had a gleam in his eyes and a smile on his face that told me without words that we were going to solve that problem or meet that challenge. And we did because of him. As an administrative law judge and tax collector, he earned the respect and admiration of the public, even when his rulings and application of law were not in their favor. He was straightforward and fair, which South Dakotans appreciate. As the head of Bureau of Administration, he led and championed many projects that increased the efficiency of State government to serve the people and preserved the heritage of South Dakota in the people's house--our State capitol. But more important than all of his career accomplishments is the kind of person Paul Kinsman was. He was a loving husband, father, grandfather, and friend to all who knew him. He had a tremendously positive impact on the many thousands of people he met and touched with his kindness and generosity. With this, I welcome the opportunity to recognize and commemorate the life and legacy of this public servant and my friend, Paul Kinsman.

Mr. President, small businesses have the unique ability to challenge members of their community physically and intellectually, expanding the horizons of their neighbors and clients. It is especially noteworthy when these small businesses have the opportunity to use these talents to influence their communities. This week, I would like to recognize Studio Geaux of Jennings, LA, as small business of the week for its ongoing commitment to engage young folks in fun, physical activity in southwest Louisiana. Louisiana native Caroline Cormier grew up dancing, and while pursuing a bachelor of arts in theatre and dance at Louisiana State University, she joined the school's elite dance team, the Golden Girls. Upon graduation, Cormier relocated to Atlanta, GA, to continue her studies at some of the most challenging and exclusive dance and fitness studios in the South. Three years later, Cormier gained the confidence and skills necessary to return to Louisiana and pursue her lifelong dream of launching her own dance studio and successfully did so, opening the doors to Studio Geaux in August 2014. Today Studio Geaux offers classes in ballet, tap, jazz, hip hop, and physical conditioning for students aged 2-18. Additionally, Cormier and her team began Dance on the Geaux, a program that provides dance classes to young students in local schools. Cormier designed the program to help increase awareness of and participation in the arts and also to help make the life of a busy parent a little easier. Congratulations again to Studio Geaux for being selected as the Small Business of the Week. Thank you for your continued commitment to the arts community in Acadiana, and I look forward to your continued growth and success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S90] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING STUDIO GEAUX Mr. VITTER.

This week, I would like to recognize Studio Geaux of Jennings, LA, as small business of the week for its ongoing commitment to engage young folks in fun, physical activity in southwest Louisiana. Louisiana native Caroline Cormier grew up dancing, and while pursuing a bachelor of arts in theatre and dance at Louisiana State University, she joined the school's elite dance team, the Golden Girls. Upon graduation, Cormier relocated to Atlanta, GA, to continue her studies at some of the most challenging and exclusive dance and fitness studios in the South. Three years later, Cormier gained the confidence and skills necessary to return to Louisiana and pursue her lifelong dream of launching her own dance studio and successfully did so, opening the doors to Studio Geaux in August 2014. Today Studio Geaux offers classes in ballet, tap, jazz, hip hop, and physical conditioning for students aged 2-18. Additionally, Cormier and her team began Dance on the Geaux, a program that provides dance classes to young students in local schools. Cormier designed the program to help increase awareness of and participation in the arts and also to help make the life of a busy parent a little easier. Congratulations again to Studio Geaux for being selected as the Small Business of the Week. Thank you for your continued commitment to the arts community in Acadiana, and I look forward to your continued growth and success. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S90] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING STUDIO GEAUX Mr. VITTER.

CREC-2016-01-19-pt1-PgS96-4,CREC-2016-01-19,114,NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S96-S97] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, some months ago, in the midst of debate on the nuclear agreement with Iran, I came to the Senate floor to remind my colleagues of some recent history involving other negotiations undertaken with troubling regimes that turned out to serve our national security interests. I reminded my Republican colleagues that John Kennedy negotiated with the Soviet Union during the Cuban missile crisis, saving us from nuclear war. I reminded them that Richard Nixon negotiated with the Chinese on normalizing relations, even while that Communist regime in China was providing weapons to the North Vietnamese, who were using them against American soldiers. I, of course, reminded them that Ronald Reagan negotiated with the Soviets while the Communist nation had thousands of nuclear weapons pointed at the United States, was occupying Eastern Europe, and was supporting troubling regimes around the world. Let us also recall how many on the right in the political spectrum savaged then President Reagan for negotiating with the Soviets on nuclear arms. Let me read an excerpt from the January 17, 1988, New York Times about the opposition--eerily familiar to what we have been hearing in the debate on the Iran nuclear agreement--Reagan faced in negotiating an arms agreement with the Soviets: Already, right-wing groups . . . have mounted a strong campaign against the INF treaty. They have mailed out close to 300,000 letters opposing it. They have circulated 5,000 cassette recordings of Gen. Bernard Rogers, former Supreme Commander of NATO, attacking it. And, finally, they are preparing to run newspaper ads this month savaging Reagan as a new Neville Chamberlain, signing an accord with Hitler and gullibly predicting ``peace for our time.'' Conservative Washington Post columnist George Will said in a 1987 Newsweek column of negotiating arms agreements with the Soviets, ``Reagan has dramatically advanced the moral and psychological disarmament of the West by emphatically siding with those . . . who emphasize the role of ideology, and hence the radical differentness and dangerousness of the Soviet threat.'' The conservative National Review's May 22, 1987, edition had the following cover entitled ``Reagan's Suicide Pact'' concerning Reagan's negotiation with the Soviets. While opposed by some at the time, few in this Chamber would look back today and say that these negotiations were a mistake or that the agreements that were reached between Reagan and the Soviets didn't actually serve long-term American national security interests. So we are here today with the fulfillment of the first stage of a historic agreement between world powers and Iran that has effectively eliminated that country's ability to build a nuclear weapon--a weapon that could have threatened our close allies and the world. Only a few months after this agreement was reached, Iran has met its critical commitments. It destroyed its only source of weapons-grade plutonium by literally pouring concrete into the heart of the reactor. It shipped 98 percent of its low-enriched uranium, at least 25,000 pounds--some 12 tons--of this low-enriched uranium out of the country. Recall that thanks to the interim agreement, Iran had already shipped out all of its more dangerous highly enriched uranium. It dismantled and removed two-thirds of its centrifuges--thousands of its centrifuges--and it has allowed international inspectors unprecedented access to its nuclear facilities and supply chain. A simple question to the critics of the Iran nuclear agreement: Today, is Iran closer or further away from the development of a nuclear weapon? The answer is that it is further away. There is no other reasonable conclusion. Do you remember the speeches given by Prime Minister Netanyahu and many of the critics of this agreement? They were telling us that Iran was weeks away from developing a nuclear weapon. Now by consensus we believe they are at least 1 year away from developing a nuclear weapon if they completely walked away from this agreement. Without a nuclear weapon, Iran is not the same kind of threat to the Middle East, Israel, or to the world. All of what I said has been verified by international inspectors. Do you recall Ronald Reagan reminding us to trust but verify? We verified. The agreement gives inspectors continued access in perpetuity. In a few months, Iran has gone from a breakout time of a nuclear weapon from a month or 2 to at least 1 year. Quite simply, under Barack Obama's Iran nuclear weapon agreement, their program has finally been brought to a halt without firing a shot--something no previous administration had been able to accomplish. That such a difficult task was accomplished is a testament to the tireless work of our former colleague and current Secretary of State John Kerry and his team. This Senator thinks of all those who worked so hard on this for so many months to achieve it. Tough diplomacy has also brought home a number of Americans who were unjustly held in Iran. These Americans had not even left Iranian airspace before many of the Republicans running for President unleashed another wave of worn-out rhetoric criticizing the President's effort that led to the release of these Americans being held prisoner. They also failed to offer a substantive alternative approach. Let me remind the naysayers that it was Ronald Reagan who traded weapons to Iran for seven American hostages being held by Iranian terrorists in Lebanon-- not a handful of nonviolent sanctions violators but weapons to what was then our arch enemy who had only recently held more than 60 American diplomats as hostages for 444 days. By the time the sales were discovered, more than 1,500 missiles had been shipped by the Reagan administration to Iran and only 3 hostages had been released. They in turn were replaced with three more, sadly, in what then-Secretary of State George Shultz called ``a hostage bazaar.'' I have met the families of those held hostage, and I can't say what I would [[Page S97]] do in each case if I were President in those heartbreaking situations. But I do know it is far easier for these Republican Presidential candidates and critics of this administration to arm-chair the Secretary of State or President than to actually make the tough decisions that brought these men and women back home to the United States. While I applaud the nuclear deal and the release of the detained Americans, I am under no illusions about the Iranian regime. I believe there is a faction in Iran that wants Iran to integrate into the global community and reject Iranian belligerence in the region. Certainly a large number of the Iranian people feel that way. But there are deeply troubling hardliners in Iran as well. They continue to support some of the most troubling groups in the region, from Hezbollah, to Hamas, to the Assad regime. They continue to imprison their own people for wanting more freedoms. They threaten Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East, and the region's broader security. I hope that recent events mark the beginning of a gradual change away from these hardline policies and that we can continue to work with wiser voices on shared challenges such as Afghanistan and Syria. Until then, the administration has wisely maintained sanctions on Iran for its support of these terrorist groups and human rights violations. I also strongly support the most recent sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile testing announced by the Obama regime. The world will have ongoing, intensive inspection of Iran's remaining nuclear infrastructure to make sure there is no cheating on the agreement. It is always easy to threaten force or simply say that troubling regimes must bow to a rhetorical demand. It is another thing to actually use diplomacy to reach these goals. Let's not forget the price in lives, treasure, and regional upheaval that the Iraq war caused us-- prices we continue to pay to this day. To end Iran's nuclear weapons program without another devastating war is remarkable and worth the risk. We should follow the words of President Kennedy: ``Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 10 (Tuesday, January 19, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S96-S97] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN Mr. DURBIN.
