Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Dr. Mary Jo Franco French, M.D., (Mary Jo), who passed away on December 31, 2015. A native Phoenician, Mary Jo was a revered leader in the Latino community, whose imprint on the city touched a countless number of people. She was the daughter of the Mexican Consul to Arizona, attended Xavier College Prep, ASU and medical school in Mexico City. From 1970-1980, Mary Jo was the editor of El Sol, the first Phoenix Spanish newspaper, which her parents launched in the 1930's. Mary Jo served on the Board of Directors of Alma de la Gente, the El Mirage Diabetes Coalition, Vesta Club, and Friends of Mexican Art. As the Executive Director of Hispanic Health Coalition, Mary Jo addressed critical health issues confronting the Valley's Latino families. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Mary Jo to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS). As an Honorary General, Mary Jo met with service women throughout the world, discussing the challenges faced by our enlisted women. Mary Jo chaired the Veterans Day Parade and the Grand Army Ball; in 1988 she received the George Washington Award for distinguished civil service. For her years of leadership, Valle del Sol honored Mary Jo with the Profiles of Success Award in 1994. She was a principal strategist behind Pope John Paul II's visit to Phoenix in 1987. Above all else, Mary Jo was Alfred's wife for over 43 years, she was mother to Laura and Alfred Jr. and grandmother to Maya and Aran. Members, please join me in extending condolences to the Franco French family, as they mourn the loss of Mary Jo, an iconic woman, trailblazer and role model and who will be dearly missed and fondly remembered by all whose lives were made better because of her. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 14 (Monday, January 25, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E53] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORIAM, DR.

Like many of her generation, Ashley signed up to work on President Obama's first presidential campaign in 2008, and she believed that she could truly make a difference. And she did make a difference, both at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and in my own office on Capitol Hill helping to keep my constituents informed and continuing to promote the Democratic agenda. I was most struck by how much she touched and stayed in touch with her former friends and colleagues in Washington. It is clear that her passing affected everyone very deeply. I will remember Ashley both for her tireless work and for her sweet and bright smile. She brought people together and was a true friend in life as is evident in the outpouring of sympathy in the Capitol Hill community. I join Ashley's friends and family in mourning her loss and celebrating a wonderful young woman who was taken from us too early. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 14 (Monday, January 25, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E53] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE PASSING OF ASHLEY GAMMON ______ HON.

Mr. Gibbs-Bowling has been an intrepid leader in the Tacoma community, where he grew up, through his excellent instruction of AP Government and Human Geography at Lincoln High School. I am proud to offer my sincere congratulations on behalf of my district's constituency to Mr. Gibbs-Bowling for the recent announcement of his selection as a finalist for this year's National Teacher of the Year Award offered by the Council of Chief State School Officers. For 10 years Nathan has exceeded expectations as an instructor and has become known as the ``cheerleader, college professor, and drill sergeant'' for Lincoln High's student population. His dedication to his craft and his student's success has set him apart more than once in recent years. Mr. Gibbs-Bowling has already received accolades for his teaching. He received the Washington State Milken Foundation Educator Award for 2013, and was named the Washington State Teacher of the Year by the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction in 2015. Yet, if you ask him, he will insist that he is not even the best teacher in his own household--his wife Hope also teaches at the high school. Mr. Speaker, I have had the pleasure of attending Nathan's classroom to visit with his students. He has consistently impressed me with his control of the classroom and the respect that his students show him-- it's clear that he is loved and appreciated within the halls of Lincoln High. Nathan's service extends to efforts outside of the classroom, as well. He is the co-founder of the school's Professional Leadership Development Team, has created Teachers United--a research and advocacy group that engages with local community leaders and elected officials on important issues--and has helped develop curriculum on both Tacoma and Washington State history. Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to represent a man of this caliber here in our nation's capital. I am truly humbled to be able to speak in recognition of the many achievements of Nathan Gibbs-Bowling today in the United States Congress. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 14 (Monday, January 25, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E53] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY OF TACOMA OF LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER NATHAN GIBBS-BOWLING ______ HON.

RICHARD M. NOLAN of minnesota in the house of representatives Monday, January 25, 2016 Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the students in the Youth in Government Club at Brainerd High School (BHS). Last week thirteen students in the club: Alison Jones, Sean Paulus, Thea Fisher, Ellen Hickman, Alyssa Neistadt, Emma Anderson, Nick Ashman, Rachel Cleveland, Marina Cruz, Caleb Meyer, Anthony Rice, Lillian Schmitz, and Claire Waltion participated in a four-day assembly at the state Capitol in St. Paul. During the assembly students from across Minnesota assumed roles of state legislators, executive branch staffers, lobbyists, and political reporters. Students then dealt with bills on topical issues such as: stricter sentences for drunk drivers, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, and changes to state curriculum requirements for public secondary schools. I would also like to recognize Amy Aho, the club's faculty advisor for all her hard work coordinating the club's participation in the assembly. As a teacher myself I admire her passion for helping her students pursue their interest in public policy. Amy's participation allowed students to take part in a unique, valuable, hands-on experience which will help them to become our future leaders. The Youth in Government Club at BHS gives students experience in how government works and an opportunity to learn more about the legislative process. Their level of interest and engagement is very impressive and I would not be at all surprised to see any of them representing Minnesota in Congress one day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 14 (Monday, January 25, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E54] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FUTURE LEGISLATORS: BRAINERD HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH IN GOVERNMENT CLUB ______ HON.

The Freedom of Information Act enables individual citizens to request records and information from federal agencies, and is therefore one of the greatest tools available to the public to ensure accountability and transparency.

Unnecessary complications, misapplication of the law, and extensive delays are common occurrences.'' H.R. 653 will make great strides in correcting, protecting, and ultimately strengthening FOIA by providing greater disclosure of records and encouraging greater federal agency compliance.
