Madam President, before I complete the following closeout here, I want to make a comment this morning. What we have just done is move consideration of the energy bill--the Energy Policy Modernization Act--from today to tomorrow. It is a little bit unusual, but given what we have seen here, not only in Washington, DC, but all around the East [[Page S168]] Coast with the weather, the blizzard of 2016, it is understandable that we would allow for a period of time for our colleagues to return to the U.S. Senate. I think it is more than an understatement to say that it has been challenging to travel, challenging to move. I think it is worth noting, however, that the Acting President pro tempore, the Senator from Maine, and myself, the Senator from Alaska--both kind of the bookends of the country, arctic States, if you will; certainly Alaska is, and Maine is right up there--are here braving the elements. I might also note for a little historical perspective that as we convene this morning, and you look around the Chamber, the Acting President pro tempore is female, our Parliamentarian and all of our clerks are female, our floor managers are female, and all of our pages are female. This was not orchestrated in any way, shape or form. We came in this morning, looked around and thought: something is different this morning--different in a good way, I might add. But something is genuinely different, and I think it is genuinely fabulous. Perhaps it speaks to the hardiness of women who put on their boots and put on their hat and get out and slog through the mess that is out there. I don't know about you all, but I spent a good portion of my weekend shoveling. I feel stronger today, but I am ready to be back at work where it is a little less rigorous. It has been an interesting weekend with, again, the extent of the blizzard. I have been asked numerous times: Well, this must just be a normal day for you in Alaska. We haven't had the snow that we would like back home. In fact, we got as much snowfall here in the D.C. metropolitan area as Anchorage, my hometown, has had accumulated over the course of this season. We have been feeling a little left out of the weather events. I was looking at Facebook over the weekend. There is one post out there that I thought was pretty Alaskan. It said: ``Not to be outdone in winter, #Alaska sees East Coast blizzard and raises it with major #earthquake.'' We had a little bit of excitement back home with a 7.1 earthquake. But the good news for us throughout the State is that while it certainly got everyone's attention at 1 o'clock in the morning, it did not cause significant damage. We are thankful for that. We are also thankful that as we are digging out of the snowstorms here and throughout the East, people are making it through. But our thoughts and our prayers are for those who have suffered as a consequence of this weather-related tragedy in many, many cases. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 15 (Tuesday, January 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S167-S168] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BLIZZARD OF 2016 Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Madam President, before I complete the following closeout here, I want to make a comment this morning. What we have just done is move consideration of the energy bill--the Energy Policy Modernization Act--from today to tomorrow. It is a little bit unusual, but given what we have seen here, not only in Washington, DC, but all around the East [[Page S168]] Coast with the weather, the blizzard of 2016, it is understandable that we would allow for a period of time for our colleagues to return to the U.S. Senate. I think it is more than an understatement to say that it has been challenging to travel, challenging to move. I think it is worth noting, however, that the Acting President pro tempore, the Senator from Maine, and myself, the Senator from Alaska--both kind of the bookends of the country, arctic States, if you will; certainly Alaska is, and Maine is right up there--are here braving the elements. I might also note for a little historical perspective that as we convene this morning, and you look around the Chamber, the Acting President pro tempore is female, our Parliamentarian and all of our clerks are female, our floor managers are female, and all of our pages are female. This was not orchestrated in any way, shape or form. We came in this morning, looked around and thought: something is different this morning--different in a good way, I might add. But something is genuinely different, and I think it is genuinely fabulous. Perhaps it speaks to the hardiness of women who put on their boots and put on their hat and get out and slog through the mess that is out there. I don't know about you all, but I spent a good portion of my weekend shoveling. I feel stronger today, but I am ready to be back at work where it is a little less rigorous. It has been an interesting weekend with, again, the extent of the blizzard. I have been asked numerous times: Well, this must just be a normal day for you in Alaska. We haven't had the snow that we would like back home. In fact, we got as much snowfall here in the D.C. metropolitan area as Anchorage, my hometown, has had accumulated over the course of this season. We have been feeling a little left out of the weather events. I was looking at Facebook over the weekend. There is one post out there that I thought was pretty Alaskan. It said: ``Not to be outdone in winter, #Alaska sees East Coast blizzard and raises it with major #earthquake.'' We had a little bit of excitement back home with a 7.1 earthquake. But the good news for us throughout the State is that while it certainly got everyone's attention at 1 o'clock in the morning, it did not cause significant damage. We are thankful for that. We are also thankful that as we are digging out of the snowstorms here and throughout the East, people are making it through. But our thoughts and our prayers are for those who have suffered as a consequence of this weather-related tragedy in many, many cases. ____________________",package_114_133.csv,3181,3181,3251,"[congressional record volume 162, number 15 (tuesday, january 26, 2016)] [senate] [pages s167-s168] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] blizzard of 2016 ms. murkowski. madam president, before i complete the following closeout here, i want to make a comment this morning. what we have just done is move consideration of the energy bill--the energy policy modernization act--from today to tomorrow. it is a little bit unusual, but given what we have seen here, not only in washington, dc, but all around the east [[page s168]] coast with the weather, the blizzard of 2016, it is understandable that we would allow for a period of time for our colleagues to return to the u.s. senate. i think it is more than an understatement to say that it has been challenging to travel, challenging to move. i think it is worth noting, however, that the acting president pro tempore, the senator from maine, and myself, the senator from alaska--both kind of the bookends of the country, arctic states, if you will; certainly alaska is, and maine is right up there--are here braving the elements. i might also note for a little historical perspective that as we convene this morning, and you look around the chamber, the acting president pro tempore is female, our parliamentarian and all of our clerks are female, our floor managers are female, and all of our pages are female. this was not orchestrated in any way, shape or form. we came in this morning, looked around and thought: something is different this morning--different in a good way, i might add. but something is genuinely different, and i think it is genuinely fabulous. perhaps it speaks to the hardiness of women who put on their boots and put on their hat and get out and slog through the mess that is out there. i don't know about you all, but i spent a good portion of my weekend shoveling. i feel stronger today, but i am ready to be back at work where it is a little less rigorous. it has been an interesting weekend with, again, the extent of the blizzard. i have been asked numerous times: well, this must just be a normal day for you in alaska. we haven't had the snow that we would like back home. in fact, we got as much snowfall here in the d.c. metropolitan area as anchorage, my hometown, has had accumulated over the course of this season. we have been feeling a little left out of the weather events. i was looking at facebook over the weekend. there is one post out there that i thought was pretty alaskan. it said: ``not to be outdone in winter, #alaska sees east coast blizzard and raises it with major #earthquake.'' we had a little bit of excitement back home with a 7.1 earthquake. but the good news for us throughout the state is that while it certainly got everyone's attention at 1 o'clock in the morning, it did not cause significant damage. we are thankful for that. we are also thankful that as we are digging out of the snowstorms here and throughout the east, people are making it through. but our thoughts and our prayers are for those who have suffered as a consequence of this weather-related tragedy in many, many cases. ____________________",3181

CREC-2016-01-26-pt1-PgS168,CREC-2016-01-26,114,TRIBUTE TO DAVID GRANNIS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 15 (Tuesday, January 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S168-S169] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DAVID GRANNIS Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute and offer my heartfelt thanks to one of my most trusted advisers, David Grannis. David has served me on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for over a decade, beginning as my designee in March of 2005, then as my staff director from January of 2009 when I took over as chairman of the Committee. Over this decade, I have grown to trust his expertise and advice on all aspects of our oversight of the Intelligence Community and to rely on David's keen abilities to manage the committee in a fair and bipartisan manner, while shepherding through some of the Nation's most important and sometimes controversial legislation. Prior to joining the Intelligence Committee in 2005, David worked on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security and was the senior policy adviser to Representative Jane Harman on matters of national security. Before coming to Congress, David worked for 2 years at the National Research Council's Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology on projects studying the ability to make explosives more detectable and identifiable. He has a master's of public policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he worked for now- Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who I understand recommended him to Representative Harman. David is a proven expert on both process and substance, which I am certain he developed by applying his characteristic analytic approach to everything, a skill he developed while a student in chemistry at Cornell University. David's accomplishments on the Intelligence Committee are extensive, so I will mention only a few of the highlights today. As staff director, David played a central role in assisting and guiding me and the committee through all stages of the committee's study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, where a deft hand was required to negotiate numerous aspects of the review with the CIA and the administration. He played a significant role in prodding the administration to provide information and access to critically important material. He worked with the committee study team to declassify and secure release of a 500-page executive summary of the full 6,700-page report, a process that required months of excruciatingly detailed negotiations. The report is believed to be the largest review in congressional history. After the release of the declassified summary, David helped me and Senator McCain draft and pass legislation that will help ensure these types of harsh interrogation techniques will never be used again by the CIA or any other agency or representative of the U.S. Government. David also managed the bipartisan committee staff as it helped pass seven straight intelligence authorization bills from 2009 to the most recent one, which was signed by the President last month under the leadership of Chairman Burr. This effort, which helps ensure proper oversight of the intelligence community, was a significant achievement as no legislative guidance had been provided to the intelligence community during the previous 5 years prior to 2009. I thank David for leading the staff development of these bills and helping to successfully push them through Senate passage to bring them to the President's desk. Another recent significant accomplishment in which David's steady hand and expert advice helped achieve success is his work on the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. This act, which was signed by the President last month, will help this Nation defend itself from cyber attacks by encouraging increased information sharing on cyber intrusions between private industry and the government. As staff director, David also oversaw the completion of two important committee reviews. The first one was a committee report on the 2009 Christmas Day attempted bombing of flight 253 over Detroit, and the second one was a bipartisan report on the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Each unflinchingly laid out the facts and helped determine what changes should be made as an appropriate response. David also worked to improve oversight of counterterrorism operations that helped assure the American public that Congress knew the details of what was being done by the executive branch, as well as provided recommendations for improvements. In 2007, David worked on the committee's investigation into prewar intelligence regarding Iraq. David served as the co-lead for the committee's sixth and final report on this topic, which dealt with the subject of prewar statements by senior policymakers. This was an important and sensitive subject, and David and his staff colleagues handled it with objectivity and professionalism. The report, approved by a bipartisan majority of the committee in June 2008, helped resolve a number of important questions regarding the run-up to the Iraq War. The great work that David and his colleagues did on this project ensured that the public finally received the facts and helped conclude what had at times been a contentious chapter in the committee's history. I also want to echo many of the comments that our committee staff has made about David including one that was passed onto me where a colleague said that he ``has been the rock upon which the staff's foundation is built.'' He has been a solid and stable leader that has provided the confidence that the staff needs to flourish. David's intellect and knowledge of the intelligence community and his communication skills in conveying that knowledge to committee members has gained him the respect and admiration of the entire committee. Finally, his demeanor and behavior in dealing with people, both inside and outside the committee, on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies of Congress, as well [[Page S169]] as with leaders of the intelligence community and the executive branch, is an example to be emulated. As I mentioned earlier, these are just a few of David's traits and accomplishments that I have come to rely upon while he served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And I thank him for them. I also want to thank David's wife, Kerry Searle Grannis, for enduring the long hours and time away from home that is often a part of life in the Senate; and to acknowledge their three beautiful children--Owen, Amelia, and Nathaniel--who I hope now will have more time with their father, who can help them achieve more Boy Scout badges, excel in drama classes, and perfect that high board dive and soccer goal. Kerry has mentioned how wonderful a husband and father David has been, supporting her as she completed her Ph.D. and sharing all household chores, driving duties, and doctors' appointments for his busy crew. I know David will thrive as he begins a new set of challenges as the Principal Deputy Under Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis. I wish him the very best and thank him for his many years of service and dedication to this country and to me. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 15 (Tuesday, January 26, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S168-S169] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DAVID GRANNIS Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Prior to joining the Intelligence Committee in 2005, David worked on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security and was the senior policy adviser to Representative Jane Harman on matters of national security. Before coming to Congress, David worked for 2 years at the National Research Council's Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology on projects studying the ability to make explosives more detectable and identifiable. He has a master's of public policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he worked for now- Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who I understand recommended him to Representative Harman. David is a proven expert on both process and substance, which I am certain he developed by applying his characteristic analytic approach to everything, a skill he developed while a student in chemistry at Cornell University. David's accomplishments on the Intelligence Committee are extensive, so I will mention only a few of the highlights today. As staff director, David played a central role in assisting and guiding me and the committee through all stages of the committee's study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, where a deft hand was required to negotiate numerous aspects of the review with the CIA and the administration. He played a significant role in prodding the administration to provide information and access to critically important material. He worked with the committee study team to declassify and secure release of a 500-page executive summary of the full 6,700-page report, a process that required months of excruciatingly detailed negotiations. The report is believed to be the largest review in congressional history. After the release of the declassified summary, David helped me and Senator McCain draft and pass legislation that will help ensure these types of harsh interrogation techniques will never be used again by the CIA or any other agency or representative of the U.S. Government. David also managed the bipartisan committee staff as it helped pass seven straight intelligence authorization bills from 2009 to the most recent one, which was signed by the President last month under the leadership of Chairman Burr. This effort, which helps ensure proper oversight of the intelligence community, was a significant achievement as no legislative guidance had been provided to the intelligence community during the previous 5 years prior to 2009. I thank David for leading the staff development of these bills and helping to successfully push them through Senate passage to bring them to the President's desk. Another recent significant accomplishment in which David's steady hand and expert advice helped achieve success is his work on the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. This act, which was signed by the President last month, will help this Nation defend itself from cyber attacks by encouraging increased information sharing on cyber intrusions between private industry and the government. As staff director, David also oversaw the completion of two important committee reviews. The first one was a committee report on the 2009 Christmas Day attempted bombing of flight 253 over Detroit, and the second one was a bipartisan report on the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Each unflinchingly laid out the facts and helped determine what changes should be made as an appropriate response. David also worked to improve oversight of counterterrorism operations that helped assure the American public that Congress knew the details of what was being done by the executive branch, as well as provided recommendations for improvements. In 2007, David worked on the committee's investigation into prewar intelligence regarding Iraq. David served as the co-lead for the committee's sixth and final report on this topic, which dealt with the subject of prewar statements by senior policymakers. This was an important and sensitive subject, and David and his staff colleagues handled it with objectivity and professionalism. The report, approved by a bipartisan majority of the committee in June 2008, helped resolve a number of important questions regarding the run-up to the Iraq War. The great work that David and his colleagues did on this project ensured that the public finally received the facts and helped conclude what had at times been a contentious chapter in the committee's history. I also want to echo many of the comments that our committee staff has made about David including one that was passed onto me where a colleague said that he ``has been the rock upon which the staff's foundation is built.'' He has been a solid and stable leader that has provided the confidence that the staff needs to flourish. David's intellect and knowledge of the intelligence community and his communication skills in conveying that knowledge to committee members has gained him the respect and admiration of the entire committee. Finally, his demeanor and behavior in dealing with people, both inside and outside the committee, on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies of Congress, as well [[Page S169]] as with leaders of the intelligence community and the executive branch, is an example to be emulated. As I mentioned earlier, these are just a few of David's traits and accomplishments that I have come to rely upon while he served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And I thank him for them. I also want to thank David's wife, Kerry Searle Grannis, for enduring the long hours and time away from home that is often a part of life in the Senate; and to acknowledge their three beautiful children--Owen, Amelia, and Nathaniel--who I hope now will have more time with their father, who can help them achieve more Boy Scout badges, excel in drama classes, and perfect that high board dive and soccer goal. Kerry has mentioned how wonderful a husband and father David has been, supporting her as she completed her Ph.D. and sharing all household chores, driving duties, and doctors' appointments for his busy crew. I know David will thrive as he begins a new set of challenges as the Principal Deputy Under Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis. I wish him the very best and thank him for his many years of service and dedication to this country and to me. ____________________",package_114_133.csv,7238,7238,7308,"[congressional record volume
