Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, at approximately 8:40 p.m. on February 25, 1991, an Iraqi Scud missile blasted through the temporary barracks of the 14th Quartermaster in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Headquartered in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, the 69 members of the water purification unit were deployed to Saudi Arabia for just 6 days when the attack occurred. Twenty-eight soldiers died that day, and 99 were wounded, including 43 in the 14th. The Scud attack proved to be the single most devastating attack on U.S. forces as the 14th Quartermaster suffered the single greatest number of casualties of any Allied unit during Operation Desert Storm. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of this attack, I am introducing a joint resolution that honors the soldiers who were lost and wounded and their families. The State of Pennsylvania lost more servicemembers during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm than any other State. A monument now stands in dedication at the Greensburg Army Reserve Center commemorating the 69 names of the detachment soldiers. They were fathers, husbands, and sons. They were daughters and sisters. They were all citizen soldiers serving their communities, serving their country, and giving their lives to both. I call on Members of Congress to cosponsor this resolution and honor the service and sacrifice of the 14th Quartermaster of the United States Army. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Page H821] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING THE LIVES LOST FROM THE 14TH QUARTERMASTER, OPERATION DESERT STORM (Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

But the best ones, the ones who inspire you, are the ones who remind you why you got involved in the first place: to help others. Today I rise in memory of one of the best. Bunny Steinman passed away on January 20, but her impact on the Florida Democratic Party and our community will surely last for decades. Bunny was a born trailblazer. Long before retiring to south Florida, she graduated from Syracuse. She earned a master's at Queens College. She worked in public education for over three decades, all while raising three kids with her late husband, Joseph. As her family mourns the loss of a mother and a grandmother, our community mourns the loss of a friend, a leader, and a mentor. Indeed, Bunny was so many things to so many people all at once. She was a teacher who never stopped teaching, an activist who never stopped organizing, a Democrat who never stopped believing that America is strongest when the right to vote is protected, when equal rights are respected, and when every child has the chance to thrive. Bunny Steinman, it was an honor to know you, to work with you, to represent you, and, most of all, to be your friend. We will honor your memory by carrying forward your passion for progress and the betterment of all. You will continue to inspire us for years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Page H822] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BUNNY STEINMAN (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, when you run for public office, you get to meet amazing people passionate about politics at every level. But the best ones, the ones who inspire you, are the ones who remind you why you got involved in the first place: to help others. Today I rise in memory of one of the best. Bunny Steinman passed away on January 20, but her impact on the Florida Democratic Party and our community will surely last for decades. Bunny was a born trailblazer. Long before retiring to south Florida, she graduated from Syracuse. She earned a master's at Queens College. She worked in public education for over three decades, all while raising three kids with her late husband, Joseph.

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated public servant of Louisiana, Mr. Leroy ``Slick'' Seal, who passed away recently. He was 95 years old. Mr. Seal was born on September 2, 1920, in Varnado, Louisiana, where he was a lifelong resident and law enforcement officer. Leroy began his career in 1950 when then-Governor Earl K. Long appointed him to serve as the first marshal in Varnado. When he left that post in 1954, he went on to work for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries until 1979. During that time, Leroy was selected by his peers as top woodsman and earned the position of major. Mr. Seal moved from the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to serve as chief deputy of the Washington Parish Sheriff's office from 1981 to 1991. He was elected chief of police in his hometown of Varnado in 1992, where he served until 2008, though he continued to serve Varnado as a police officer until 2012. Mr. Seal committed 60 years of his life to protecting the people of Louisiana. While in the line of duty as a law enforcement official, he was inducted into the Louisiana Justice Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2013, he was duly recognized by the Louisiana State Legislature where they declared September 2 Leroy ``Slick'' Seal Day. Mr. Seal is survived by his children, Eathel Seal, Stanley Seal, and Randy Seal, as well as his 15 grandchildren and numerous great- grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. I commend Mr. Seal for all the work he has done for Louisiana. May he rest in peace. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Page H822] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF LEROY ``SLICK'' SEAL (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, last week our Nation lost an incredible man and jurist: Justice Antonin Scalia. As a steadfast defender of the rule of law, Scalia was a pillar of the Supreme Court for nearly 30 years. He was a man of God and a champion of religious freedom. In a recent speech, Justice Scalia reflected on the role of faith in society. While discussing his time in Rome in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, he recalled watching President Bush ask God to bless our Nation and a later conversation he had with a jurist from a different country who expressed his own desire for his nation's leader to be able to publicly evoke God's name during a time of national crisis, as it was forbidden. This moving speech serves as a reminder of the importance of fighting for our basic liberties that we hold so dearly. Justice Scalia, who consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of what our Founding Fathers intended, was a fierce and loyal leader in this fight. It was through his strong adherence to our Constitution, his sharp analytical mind, and his unwillingness to compromise his principles that made him a brilliant jurist; though it was his unreserved vitality and unwavering love for his country that made him a widely admired and beloved friend to his supporters and adversaries alike. I had a chance to meet Justice Scalia a couple of different times and hear him and even talk with him and ask him questions. Indeed, I was blessed by that. I rise today to extend my deepest sympathies to his family. He will certainly be missed by our Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Page H822] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 2109. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In the last 12 years, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has provided almost $100 billion in disaster relief and disaster assistance. However, a significant and increasing amount of these funds have gone to cover FEMA's administrative costs that support the delivery of disaster assistance. The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, has been looking into this for some time and found that, between fiscal year 1989 and fiscal year 2011, the percentage of disaster assistance spent on administrative costs doubled from 9 to 18 percent. While FEMA has tried to implement internal controls to keep these costs to a minimum, GAO has found that FEMA's administrative costs have not decreased. In fact, GAO estimates that internal controls could save hundreds of millions of dollars in administrative costs. S. 2109, the Directing Dollars to Disaster Relief Act of 2015, seeks to control and reduce rising administrative costs from major disasters by requiring the administrator of FEMA to develop and implement a plan to control and reduce its internal administrative costs. I would like to commend and thank the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for introducing this important oversight measure, which will save taxpayer dollars. I would also like to thank the Senate chairman for working with us to ensure that the legislation includes a sunset provision and is consistent with our House protocols. As disasters become more frequent and severe, it will become critical to keep administrative costs in FEMA to a minimum, increase efficiencies, and ensure that resources are directed toward disaster victims and the restoration of infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. [[Page H824]] Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 2109, the Directing Dollars to Disaster Relief Act of 2015, requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to develop a plan to control and reduce its disaster-related administrative costs and other activities. The GAO has noted that FEMA's costs incurred in administering disaster-related activities have increased substantially. FEMA has acknowledged the increase and has struggled to address this issue. Most recently, in 2014, the GAO recommended that FEMA develop an integrated plan to control and reduce disaster-related administrative costs. GAO also recommended that FEMA assess the feasibility of tracking administrative costs by disaster program, such as public assistance and individual assistance. Finally, GAO recommended that FEMA clarify its guidance and minimum documentation requirements for State and local governments with respect to their direct administrative costs. This bill, Mr. Speaker, will codify these recommendations and statutorily require FEMA to take these actions. I appreciate the improvements this bill will make toward reducing overall disaster costs and losses, but this is not enough. We must do more to reduce these costs and losses, Mr. Speaker. There is no better way than to invest in predisaster mitigation. I introduced H.R. 830 to reauthorize the predisaster hazard mitigation program. We consistently talk about the potential to reduce disaster costs and save taxpayers money through predisaster mitigation. In fact, our subcommittee has noted the reports by the Congressional Budget Office and the National Institute of Building Sciences Multihazard Mitigation Council, which found that predisaster mitigation saves $3 to $4 for every dollar spent on mitigation activities. But there is more. Predisaster mitigation activities save lives and reduce injuries. It is time to stop talking and do more. Let us, Mr. Speaker, reauthorize the predisaster mitigation program at levels sufficient to significantly reduce disaster costs and save lives. Our citizens deserve this. I look forward to working with my good colleagues on the other side of the aisle to make sure that these strides will come to fruition. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2109. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H823-H824] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DIRECTING DOLLARS TO DISASTER RELIEF ACT OF 2015 Mr. KATKO.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 2109. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In the last 12 years, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has provided almost $100 billion in disaster relief and disaster assistance. However, a significant and increasing amount of these funds have gone to cover FEMA's administrative costs that support the delivery of disaster assistance. The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, has been looking into this for some time and found that, between fiscal year 1989 and fiscal year 2011, the percentage of disaster assistance spent on administrative costs doubled from 9 to 18 percent. While FEMA has tried to implement internal controls to keep these costs to a minimum, GAO has found that FEMA's administrative costs have not decreased. In fact, GAO estimates that internal controls could save hundreds of millions of dollars in administrative costs. S. 2109, the Directing Dollars to Disaster Relief Act of 2015, seeks to control and reduce rising administrative costs from major disasters by requiring the administrator of FEMA to develop and implement a plan to control and reduce its internal administrative costs. I would like to commend and thank the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for introducing this important oversight measure, which will save taxpayer dollars. I would also like to thank the Senate chairman for working with us to ensure that the legislation includes a sunset provision and is consistent with our House protocols. As disasters become more frequent and severe, it will become critical to keep administrative costs in FEMA to a minimum, increase efficiencies, and ensure that resources are directed toward disaster victims and the restoration of infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. [[Page H824]] Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 2109, the Directing Dollars to Disaster Relief Act of 2015, requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to develop a plan to control and reduce its disaster-related administrative costs and other activities. The GAO has noted that FEMA's costs incurred in administering disaster-related activities have increased substantially. FEMA has acknowledged the increase and has struggled to address this issue. Most recently, in 2014, the GAO recommended that FEMA develop an integrated plan to control and reduce disaster-related administrative costs. GAO also recommended that FEMA assess the feasibility of tracking administrative costs by disaster program, such as public assistance and individual assistance. Finally, GAO recommended that FEMA clarify its guidance and minimum documentation requirements for State and local governments with respect to their direct administrative costs. This bill, Mr. Speaker, will codify these recommendations and statutorily require FEMA to take these actions. I appreciate the improvements this bill will make toward reducing overall disaster costs and losses, but this is not enough. We must do more to reduce these costs and losses, Mr. Speaker. There is no better way than to invest in predisaster mitigation. I introduced H.R. 830 to reauthorize the predisaster hazard mitigation program. We consistently talk about the potential to reduce disaster costs and save taxpayers money through predisaster mitigation. In fact, our subcommittee has noted the reports by the Congressional Budget Office and the National Institute of Building Sciences Multihazard Mitigation Council, which found that predisaster mitigation saves $3 to $4 for every dollar spent on mitigation activities. But there is more. Predisaster mitigation activities save lives and reduce injuries. It is time to stop talking and do more. Let us, Mr. Speaker, reauthorize the predisaster mitigation program at levels sufficient to significantly reduce disaster costs and save lives. Our citizens deserve this. I look forward to working with my good colleagues on the other side of the aisle to make sure that these strides will come to fruition. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 2109. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,11771,11771,11842,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [house] [pages h823-h824] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] directing dollars to disaster relief act of 2015 mr. katko. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (s. 2109) to direct the administrator of the federal emergency management agency to develop an integrated plan to reduce administrative costs under the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act, and for other purposes. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: s. 2109 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``directing dollars to disaster relief act of 2015''. sec. 2. definitions. in this act-- (1) the term ``administrative cost''-- (a) means a cost incurred by the agency in support of the delivery of disaster assistance for a major disaster; and (b) does not include a cost incurred by a grantee or subgrantee; (2) the term ``administrator'' means the administrator of the agency; (3) the term ``agency'' means the federal emergency management agency; (4) the term ``direct administrative cost'' means a cost incurred by a grantee or subgrantee of a program authorized by the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act (42 u.s.c. 5121 et seq.) that can be identified separately and assigned to a specific project; (5) the term ``hazard mitigation program'' means the hazard mitigation grant program authorized under section 404 of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act (42 u.s.c. 5170c); (6) the term ``individual assistance program'' means the individual assistance grant program authorized under sections 408, 410, 415, 416, 426, and 502(a) of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act (42 u.s.c. 5174, 5177, 5182, 5183, 5189d, and 5192(a)); (7) the term ``major disaster'' means a major disaster declared by the president under section 401 of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act (42 u.s.c. 5170); (8) the term ``mission assignment'' has the meaning given the term in section 641 of the post-katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 (6 u.s.c. 741); and (9) the term ``public assistance program'' means the public assistance grant program authorized under sections 403(a)(3), 406, 418, 419, 428, and 502(a) of the robert t. stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act (42 u.s.c. 5170b(a)(3), 5172, 5185, 5186, 5189f, and 5192(a)). sec. 3. integrated plan for administrative cost reduction.

(2) A passenger traveling pursuant to section 44903 of title 49, United States Code (as established under the Risk- Based Security for Members of the Armed Forces Act (Public Law 112-86)), section 44927 of such title (as established under the Helping Heroes Fly Act (Public Law 113-27)), or section 44928 of such title (as established under the Honor Flight Act (Public Law 113-221)). (3) A passenger who did not voluntarily submit biographic and biometric information for a security risk assessment but is a member of a population designated by the Administrator as known and low-risk and who may be issued a unique, known traveler number by the Administrator determining that such passenger is a member of a category of travelers designated by the Administrator as known and low-risk. (b) PreCheck Operations Maintained.--In carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall ensure that expedited airport security screening remains available to passengers at or above the level that exists on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act. (c) Frequent Fliers.--If the Administrator determines that such is appropriate, the implementation of subsection (a) may be delayed by up to one year with respect to the population of passengers who did not voluntarily submit biographic and biometric information for security risk assessments but who nevertheless receive expedited airport security screening because such passengers are designated as frequent fliers by air carriers. If the Administrator uses the authority provided by this subsection, the Administrator shall notify the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate of such phased-in implementation. (d) Alternate Methods.--The Administrator may provide access to expedited airport security screening to additional passengers pursuant to an alternate method upon the submission to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate of an independent assessment of the security effectiveness of such alternate method that is conducted by an independent entity that determines that such alternate method is designed to-- (1) reliably and effectively identify passengers who likely pose a low risk to the United States aviation system; (2) mitigate the likelihood that a passenger who may pose a security threat to the United States aviation system is selected for expedited security screening; and (3) address known and evolving security risks to the United States aviation system. (e) Information Sharing.--The Administrator shall provide to the entity conducting the independent assessment under subsection (d) effectiveness testing results that are consistent with established evaluation design practices, as identified by the Comptroller General of the United States.

(g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed to-- (1) authorize or direct the Administrator to reduce or limit the availability of expedited security screening at an airport; or (2) limit the authority of the Administrator to use technologies and systems, including passenger screening canines and explosives trace detection, as a part of security screening operations. SEC. 104. SECURE FLIGHT PROGRAM. Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall-- (1) develop a process for regularly evaluating the root causes of screening errors at checkpoints across airports so that corrective measures are able to be identified; (2) implement such corrective measures to address the root causes of such screening errors occurring at the checkpoint; [[Page H826]] (3) develop additional measures to address key performance aspects related to the Secure Flight program goals and ensure that such measures clearly identify activities necessary to achieve progress towards such goals; (4) develop a mechanism to systematically document the number and causes of Secure Flight program matching errors for the purpose of improving program performance and provide program managers with timely and reliable information; (5) provide job-specific privacy refresher training for Secure Flight program staff to further protect personally identifiable information in the Secure Flight system program; and (6) develop a mechanism to comprehensively document and track key Secure Flight program privacy issues and decisions to ensure the Secure Flight program has complete information for effective oversight of its privacy controls. SEC. 105. EFFICIENCY REVIEW BY TSA. (a) Review Required.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall conduct and complete a comprehensive, agency-wide efficiency review of the Administration to identify spending reductions and administrative savings through the streamlining and any necessary restructuring of agency divisions to make the Administration more efficient. In carrying out the review under this section, the Administrator shall consider each of the following: (1) The elimination of any duplicative or overlapping programs and initiatives that can be streamlined. (2) The elimination of any unnecessary or obsolete rules, regulations, directives, or procedures. (3) Any other matters the Administrator determines are appropriate. (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 30 days after the completion of the efficiency review required under subsection (a), the Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report that specifies the results and cost savings expected to be achieved through such efficiency review. Such report shall also include information relating to how the Administration may use efficiencies identified through such efficiency review to provide funding to reimburse airports that incurred eligible costs for in-line baggage screening systems. SEC. 106. DONATION OF SCREENING EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES. (a) In General.--The Administrator is authorized to donate security screening equipment to a foreign last-point-of- departure airport operator if such equipment can be reasonably expected to mitigate a specific vulnerability to the security of the United States or United States citizens.

In conducting such feasibility assessment, the Administrator shall consider the following: (1) Establishing an independent, not-for-profit organization, modeled after the In-Q-tel program, a venture capital partnership between the private sector and the intelligence community (as such term is defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)), to help businesses, particularly small businesses, commercialize innovative security-related technologies. (2) Enhanced engagement, either through the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security or directly, with the In-Q-tel program described in paragraph (1). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act. This critical bipartisan piece of legislation ensures several congressional oversight priorities for the Transportation Security Administration are addressed, including the authorization of the PreCheck program, the advancement of risk-based security initiatives, the enhancement of aviation worker vetting, and the improvement of airport screening technologies. H.R. 3584 also takes numerous steps toward augmenting the effectiveness and efficiency of various TSA security programs within both the surface and aviation transportation sectors, and it requires the administrator to conduct an efficiency review of the entire agency. [[Page H829]] Since assuming the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security at the beginning of this Congress, I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to conduct rigorous oversight of this troubled agency. This bill is a direct result of our bipartisan efforts, and I am pleased to stand before you and have the House consider this important legislation. If signed into law, this legislation will make a direct impact on the safety and security of the traveling public and America's transportation systems. In an era of pronounced and evolving threats to the homeland, Congress must not wait to act in the best interests of transportation security. Further, the often misdirected nature of the TSA requires that we, as legislators and overseers, fulfill our obligation to reform this fledgling agency into an intelligence-driven organization. When I came to Congress, I pledged to my constituents that I would work hard to deliver results. I am proud of all the work the Committee on Homeland Security has done over the past year. I am honored to have the privilege to sponsor so many pieces of legislation that are helping to keep our country safe. I would like to thank Ranking Member Rice and Ranking Member Thompson for their time and attention to this important piece of legislation. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the full committee, for his continued support of the subcommittee's oversight efforts and for ensuring important pieces of legislation, such as H.R. 3584, are considered on the House floor. The Committee on Homeland Security's legislative results under the leadership of Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson are proof that, by working together in a bipartisan fashion, not only can we improve the security of our country, but we can demonstrate to the American people that Congress can actually work together and deliver results. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes language authored by Ranking Member Bennie Thompson to direct TSA to move away from how it identifies low-risk passengers for expedited airport screening. In recent years, both the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general and the comptroller general have been very critical about the security risks of the so-called managed inclusion process. In response, Ranking Member Thompson introduced the Securing Expedited Screening Act, which was included in this measure. We all have an interest in TSA effectively managing airport screening. Ensuring that a robust known-traveler program for low-risk travelers is built into TSA's concept of screening operations just makes sense. That is why I support the expansion of the PreCheck program, under which expedited screening is provided to travelers who have been fully vetted prior to arriving at the airport. I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes provisions to expand the public's enrollment in the PreCheck program by, among other things, coordinating with the private sector to deploy TSA-approved online and mobile enrollment centers. Another key to the effective management of airport screening is the maintenance of the security equipment. I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes language authored by Representative Rice, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, to ensure that TSA puts in place systems to ensure that when it comes to security-related technologies at our Nation's airports, timely maintenance is done and documented. According to the DHS inspector general, without proper maintenance and documentation thereof, the TSA could possibly have to resort to using alternate screening methods, which could lead to the traveling public being less safe. H.R. 3584 also includes language adopted in the full committee to help businesses, particularly small businesses, to be able to create innovative security technologies through public-private partnerships. {time} 1615 Over the years, we have seen the limitations of various security technologies in use at our airports. It is crucial that innovators continue to push the envelope in terms of detection and mitigation capabilities. Finally, as the Representative of a jurisdiction that relies heavily on mass transit, I am pleased that the bill seeks to ensure that frontline workers in our transportation sectors have the training needed to react in worst-case scenarios. The thwarted terrorist attack on a train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris last year underscores that mass transit continues to be a terrorist target. Mr. Speaker, these are only a few of the examples of provisions within this bill that will help to improve TSA operations and bolster the security of the American people. I urge support for this measure. I want to close by noting the bipartisan work that went into this legislation. There is still much to be done in the transportation security space, but the legislation before us represents a step in the right direction to address issues within the surface and aviation transportation sectors. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the issues addressed in H.R. 3584 are of vital concern to the safety of our Nation's security, and it is imperative that we send this bill to the Senate today. Congress cannot afford to wait to address critical issues that help advance and improve our security. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act, which would authorize, streamline, and identify efficiencies within the Transportation Security Administration. As a Senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee, I served as chair of this subcommittee and continue to support its work to improve transportation security. I currently serve as the Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. The work of the TSA is a front line Department of Homeland Security and it is not easy--it can in fact be very dangerous. Like many of my Colleagues, I recall the shooting incident at LAX last year that killed Gerardo Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty; and the machete attack at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport earlier this year that resulted in injuries to Senior Transportation Security Officer Carol Richel. Each day, TSA processes an average of 1.7 million passengers at more than 450 airports across the nation. In 2012, TSA screened 637,582,122 passengers. The Bush Intercontinental and the William P. Hobby Airports are essential hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston and the region: Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. Hobby (HOU). More than 650 daily departures occur at IAH. IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger traffic. IAH has 12 all-cargo airlines handling more than 419,205 metric tons of cargo in 2012. I believe that Congress has not done all that it could to make employees' work easier--Sequestration, a government shutdown, and a delay in fully funding the Department of Homeland Security was not in the security interest of the nation. Reports issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) have identified shortcomings within the Agency, raising questions how effectively TSA is fulfilling its mission. Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful procedures, retaliation against whistleblowers, low morale, and security gaps within the Agency are causes for concern. Other issues related to inconsistent requirements between what is written and what employees are told is essential for them to successfully meet the agency's standards for good performance needs work. [[Page H830]] The need for attention to TSA administrative procedures and due process within the agency to backstop decisions regarding reprimands or negative actions toward employees can be an essential step in addressing some morale issues that are related to uncertainty regarding the successful performance of duties. In other words, the same conduct by persons holding the same level of responsibility or positions within an airport results in the same positive or negative outcome. TSA is charged with: The protection of America's transportation systems; monitoring the movement of people and supplies during their use of our transportation systems; and ensuring the effectiveness and integrity of government agencies. H.R. 3584, directs the TSA to: ensure that all screening of passengers and their accessible property will be done in a risk-based, intelligence-driven manner with consideration given to the privacy and civil liberties of such passengers; and operate the ``TSA PreCheck'' program in a manner that provides expedited screening for low-risk passengers and their accessible property based on a comprehensive and continuous analysis of factors. More needs to be done to support the men and women working on the front lines of our nation's domestic security and that includes those who work at the TSA. I will continue to seek out opportunities to promote the mission of the TSA and role that TSA professionals fill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3584, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H824-H830] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION REFORM AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. KATKO.

In conducting such feasibility assessment, the Administrator shall consider the following: (1) Establishing an independent, not-for-profit organization, modeled after the In-Q-tel program, a venture capital partnership between the private sector and the intelligence community (as such term is defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)), to help businesses, particularly small businesses, commercialize innovative security-related technologies. (2) Enhanced engagement, either through the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security or directly, with the In-Q-tel program described in paragraph (1). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act. This critical bipartisan piece of legislation ensures several congressional oversight priorities for the Transportation Security Administration are addressed, including the authorization of the PreCheck program, the advancement of risk-based security initiatives, the enhancement of aviation worker vetting, and the improvement of airport screening technologies. H.R. 3584 also takes numerous steps toward augmenting the effectiveness and efficiency of various TSA security programs within both the surface and aviation transportation sectors, and it requires the administrator to conduct an efficiency review of the entire agency. [[Page H829]] Since assuming the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security at the beginning of this Congress, I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to conduct rigorous oversight of this troubled agency. This bill is a direct result of our bipartisan efforts, and I am pleased to stand before you and have the House consider this important legislation. If signed into law, this legislation will make a direct impact on the safety and security of the traveling public and America's transportation systems. In an era of pronounced and evolving threats to the homeland, Congress must not wait to act in the best interests of transportation security. Further, the often misdirected nature of the TSA requires that we, as legislators and overseers, fulfill our obligation to reform this fledgling agency into an intelligence-driven organization. When I came to Congress, I pledged to my constituents that I would work hard to deliver results. I am proud of all the work the Committee on Homeland Security has done over the past year. I am honored to have the privilege to sponsor so many pieces of legislation that are helping to keep our country safe. I would like to thank Ranking Member Rice and Ranking Member Thompson for their time and attention to this important piece of legislation. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the full committee, for his continued support of the subcommittee's oversight efforts and for ensuring important pieces of legislation, such as H.R. 3584, are considered on the House floor. The Committee on Homeland Security's legislative results under the leadership of Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson are proof that, by working together in a bipartisan fashion, not only can we improve the security of our country, but we can demonstrate to the American people that Congress can actually work together and deliver results. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes language authored by Ranking Member Bennie Thompson to direct TSA to move away from how it identifies low-risk passengers for expedited airport screening. In recent years, both the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general and the comptroller general have been very critical about the security risks of the so-called managed inclusion process. In response, Ranking Member Thompson introduced the Securing Expedited Screening Act, which was included in this measure. We all have an interest in TSA effectively managing airport screening. Ensuring that a robust known-traveler program for low-risk travelers is built into TSA's concept of screening operations just makes sense. That is why I support the expansion of the PreCheck program, under which expedited screening is provided to travelers who have been fully vetted prior to arriving at the airport. I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes provisions to expand the public's enrollment in the PreCheck program by, among other things, coordinating with the private sector to deploy TSA-approved online and mobile enrollment centers. Another key to the effective management of airport screening is the maintenance of the security equipment. I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes language authored by Representative Rice, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, to ensure that TSA puts in place systems to ensure that when it comes to security-related technologies at our Nation's airports, timely maintenance is done and documented. According to the DHS inspector general, without proper maintenance and documentation thereof, the TSA could possibly have to resort to using alternate screening methods, which could lead to the traveling public being less safe. H.R. 3584 also includes language adopted in the full committee to help businesses, particularly small businesses, to be able to create innovative security technologies through public-private partnerships. {time} 1615 Over the years, we have seen the limitations of various security technologies in use at our airports. It is crucial that innovators continue to push the envelope in terms of detection and mitigation capabilities. Finally, as the Representative of a jurisdiction that relies heavily on mass transit, I am pleased that the bill seeks to ensure that frontline workers in our transportation sectors have the training needed to react in worst-case scenarios. The thwarted terrorist attack on a train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris last year underscores that mass transit continues to be a terrorist target. Mr. Speaker, these are only a few of the examples of provisions within this bill that will help to improve TSA operations and bolster the security of the American people. I urge support for this measure. I want to close by noting the bipartisan work that went into this legislation. There is still much to be done in the transportation security space, but the legislation before us represents a step in the right direction to address issues within the surface and aviation transportation sectors. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the issues addressed in H.R. 3584 are of vital concern to the safety of our Nation's security, and it is imperative that we send this bill to the Senate today. Congress cannot afford to wait to address critical issues that help advance and improve our security. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act, which would authorize, streamline, and identify efficiencies within the Transportation Security Administration. As a Senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee, I served as chair of this subcommittee and continue to support its work to improve transportation security. I currently serve as the Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. The work of the TSA is a front line Department of Homeland Security and it is not easy--it can in fact be very dangerous. Like many of my Colleagues, I recall the shooting incident at LAX last year that killed Gerardo Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty; and the machete attack at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport earlier this year that resulted in injuries to Senior Transportation Security Officer Carol Richel. Each day, TSA processes an average of 1.7 million passengers at more than 450 airports across the nation. In 2012, TSA screened 637,582,122 passengers. The Bush Intercontinental and the William P. Hobby Airports are essential hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston and the region: Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. Hobby (HOU). More than 650 daily departures occur at IAH. IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger traffic. IAH has 12 all-cargo airlines handling more than 419,205 metric tons of cargo in 2012. I believe that Congress has not done all that it could to make employees' work easier--Sequestration, a government shutdown, and a delay in fully funding the Department of Homeland Security was not in the security interest of the nation. Reports issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) have identified shortcomings within the Agency, raising questions how effectively TSA is fulfilling its mission. Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful procedures, retaliation against whistleblowers, low morale, and security gaps within the Agency are causes for concern. Other issues related to inconsistent requirements between what is written and what employees are told is essential for them to successfully meet the agency's standards for good performance needs work. [[Page H830]] The need for attention to TSA administrative procedures and due process within the agency to backstop decisions regarding reprimands or negative actions toward employees can be an essential step in addressing some morale issues that are related to uncertainty regarding the successful performance of duties. In other words, the same conduct by persons holding the same level of responsibility or positions within an airport results in the same positive or negative outcome. TSA is charged with: The protection of America's transportation systems; monitoring the movement of people and supplies during their use of our transportation systems; and ensuring the effectiveness and integrity of government agencies. H.R. 3584, directs the TSA to: ensure that all screening of passengers and their accessible property will be done in a risk-based, intelligence-driven manner with consideration given to the privacy and civil liberties of such passengers; and operate the ``TSA PreCheck'' program in a manner that provides expedited screening for low-risk passengers and their accessible property based on a comprehensive and continuous analysis of factors. More needs to be done to support the men and women working on the front lines of our nation's domestic security and that includes those who work at the TSA. I will continue to seek out opportunities to promote the mission of the TSA and role that TSA professionals fill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3584, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H824-H830] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION REFORM AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. KATKO.

SEC. 103. LIMITATION; PRECHECK OPERATIONS MAINTAINED; ALTERNATE METHODS. (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (c), the Administrator shall direct that access to expedited airport security screening at an airport security checkpoint be limited to only the following: (1) A passenger who voluntarily submits biographic and biometric information for a security risk assessment and whose application for the PreCheck program has been approved, or a passenger who is a participant in another trusted or registered traveler program of the Department. (2) A passenger traveling pursuant to section 44903 of title 49, United States Code (as established under the Risk- Based Security for Members of the Armed Forces Act (Public Law 112-86)), section 44927 of such title (as established under the Helping Heroes Fly Act (Public Law 113-27)), or section 44928 of such title (as established under the Honor Flight Act (Public Law 113-221)). (3) A passenger who did not voluntarily submit biographic and biometric information for a security risk assessment but is a member of a population designated by the Administrator as known and low-risk and who may be issued a unique, known traveler number by the Administrator determining that such passenger is a member of a category of travelers designated by the Administrator as known and low-risk. (b) PreCheck Operations Maintained.--In carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall ensure that expedited airport security screening remains available to passengers at or above the level that exists on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act. (c) Frequent Fliers.--If the Administrator determines that such is appropriate, the implementation of subsection (a) may be delayed by up to one year with respect to the population of passengers who did not voluntarily submit biographic and biometric information for security risk assessments but who nevertheless receive expedited airport security screening because such passengers are designated as frequent fliers by air carriers. If the Administrator uses the authority provided by this subsection, the Administrator shall notify the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate of such phased-in implementation. (d) Alternate Methods.--The Administrator may provide access to expedited airport security screening to additional passengers pursuant to an alternate method upon the submission to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate of an independent assessment of the security effectiveness of such alternate method that is conducted by an independent entity that determines that such alternate method is designed to-- (1) reliably and effectively identify passengers who likely pose a low risk to the United States aviation system; (2) mitigate the likelihood that a passenger who may pose a security threat to the United States aviation system is selected for expedited security screening; and (3) address known and evolving security risks to the United States aviation system. (e) Information Sharing.--The Administrator shall provide to the entity conducting the independent assessment under subsection (d) effectiveness testing results that are consistent with established evaluation design practices, as identified by the Comptroller General of the United States. (f) Reporting.--Not later than three months after the date of the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Administrator shall report to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the percentage of all passengers who are provided expedited security screening, and of such passengers so provided, the percentage who are participants in the PreCheck program (who have voluntarily submitted biographic and biometric information for security risk assessments), the percentage who are participants in another trusted traveler program of the Department, the percentage who are participants in the PreCheck program due to the Administrator's issuance of known traveler numbers, and for the remaining percentage of passengers granted access to expedited security screening in PreCheck security lanes, information on the percentages attributable to each alternative method utilized by the Administration to direct passengers to expedited airport security screening at PreCheck security lanes. (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed to-- (1) authorize or direct the Administrator to reduce or limit the availability of expedited security screening at an airport; or (2) limit the authority of the Administrator to use technologies and systems, including passenger screening canines and explosives trace detection, as a part of security screening operations. SEC. 104. SECURE FLIGHT PROGRAM. Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall-- (1) develop a process for regularly evaluating the root causes of screening errors at checkpoints across airports so that corrective measures are able to be identified; (2) implement such corrective measures to address the root causes of such screening errors occurring at the checkpoint; [[Page H826]] (3) develop additional measures to address key performance aspects related to the Secure Flight program goals and ensure that such measures clearly identify activities necessary to achieve progress towards such goals; (4) develop a mechanism to systematically document the number and causes of Secure Flight program matching errors for the purpose of improving program performance and provide program managers with timely and reliable information; (5) provide job-specific privacy refresher training for Secure Flight program staff to further protect personally identifiable information in the Secure Flight system program; and (6) develop a mechanism to comprehensively document and track key Secure Flight program privacy issues and decisions to ensure the Secure Flight program has complete information for effective oversight of its privacy controls. SEC. 105. EFFICIENCY REVIEW BY TSA. (a) Review Required.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall conduct and complete a comprehensive, agency-wide efficiency review of the Administration to identify spending reductions and administrative savings through the streamlining and any necessary restructuring of agency divisions to make the Administration more efficient. In carrying out the review under this section, the Administrator shall consider each of the following: (1) The elimination of any duplicative or overlapping programs and initiatives that can be streamlined. (2) The elimination of any unnecessary or obsolete rules, regulations, directives, or procedures. (3) Any other matters the Administrator determines are appropriate. (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 30 days after the completion of the efficiency review required under subsection (a), the Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report that specifies the results and cost savings expected to be achieved through such efficiency review. Such report shall also include information relating to how the Administration may use efficiencies identified through such efficiency review to provide funding to reimburse airports that incurred eligible costs for in-line baggage screening systems. SEC. 106. DONATION OF SCREENING EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES. (a) In General.--The Administrator is authorized to donate security screening equipment to a foreign last-point-of- departure airport operator if such equipment can be reasonably expected to mitigate a specific vulnerability to the security of the United States or United States citizens. (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 30 days before any donation of equipment under this section, the Administrator shall provide to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a detailed written explanation of-- (1) the specific vulnerability to the United States that will be mitigated with such donation; (2) an explanation as to why the recipient is unable or unwilling to purchase equipment to mitigate such threat; (3) an evacuation plan for sensitive technologies in case of emergency or instability in the country to which such donation is being made; (4) how the Administration will ensure the equipment that is being donated is used and maintained over the course of its life by the recipient; and (5) the total dollar value of such donation.

In conducting such feasibility assessment, the Administrator shall consider the following: (1) Establishing an independent, not-for-profit organization, modeled after the In-Q-tel program, a venture capital partnership between the private sector and the intelligence community (as such term is defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)), to help businesses, particularly small businesses, commercialize innovative security-related technologies. (2) Enhanced engagement, either through the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security or directly, with the In-Q-tel program described in paragraph (1). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act. This critical bipartisan piece of legislation ensures several congressional oversight priorities for the Transportation Security Administration are addressed, including the authorization of the PreCheck program, the advancement of risk-based security initiatives, the enhancement of aviation worker vetting, and the improvement of airport screening technologies. H.R. 3584 also takes numerous steps toward augmenting the effectiveness and efficiency of various TSA security programs within both the surface and aviation transportation sectors, and it requires the administrator to conduct an efficiency review of the entire agency. [[Page H829]] Since assuming the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security at the beginning of this Congress, I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to conduct rigorous oversight of this troubled agency. This bill is a direct result of our bipartisan efforts, and I am pleased to stand before you and have the House consider this important legislation. If signed into law, this legislation will make a direct impact on the safety and security of the traveling public and America's transportation systems. In an era of pronounced and evolving threats to the homeland, Congress must not wait to act in the best interests of transportation security. Further, the often misdirected nature of the TSA requires that we, as legislators and overseers, fulfill our obligation to reform this fledgling agency into an intelligence-driven organization. When I came to Congress, I pledged to my constituents that I would work hard to deliver results. I am proud of all the work the Committee on Homeland Security has done over the past year. I am honored to have the privilege to sponsor so many pieces of legislation that are helping to keep our country safe. I would like to thank Ranking Member Rice and Ranking Member Thompson for their time and attention to this important piece of legislation. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the full committee, for his continued support of the subcommittee's oversight efforts and for ensuring important pieces of legislation, such as H.R. 3584, are considered on the House floor. The Committee on Homeland Security's legislative results under the leadership of Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson are proof that, by working together in a bipartisan fashion, not only can we improve the security of our country, but we can demonstrate to the American people that Congress can actually work together and deliver results. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes language authored by Ranking Member Bennie Thompson to direct TSA to move away from how it identifies low-risk passengers for expedited airport screening. In recent years, both the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general and the comptroller general have been very critical about the security risks of the so-called managed inclusion process. In response, Ranking Member Thompson introduced the Securing Expedited Screening Act, which was included in this measure. We all have an interest in TSA effectively managing airport screening. Ensuring that a robust known-traveler program for low-risk travelers is built into TSA's concept of screening operations just makes sense. That is why I support the expansion of the PreCheck program, under which expedited screening is provided to travelers who have been fully vetted prior to arriving at the airport. I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes provisions to expand the public's enrollment in the PreCheck program by, among other things, coordinating with the private sector to deploy TSA-approved online and mobile enrollment centers. Another key to the effective management of airport screening is the maintenance of the security equipment. I am pleased that H.R. 3584 includes language authored by Representative Rice, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, to ensure that TSA puts in place systems to ensure that when it comes to security-related technologies at our Nation's airports, timely maintenance is done and documented. According to the DHS inspector general, without proper maintenance and documentation thereof, the TSA could possibly have to resort to using alternate screening methods, which could lead to the traveling public being less safe. H.R. 3584 also includes language adopted in the full committee to help businesses, particularly small businesses, to be able to create innovative security technologies through public-private partnerships. {time} 1615 Over the years, we have seen the limitations of various security technologies in use at our airports. It is crucial that innovators continue to push the envelope in terms of detection and mitigation capabilities. Finally, as the Representative of a jurisdiction that relies heavily on mass transit, I am pleased that the bill seeks to ensure that frontline workers in our transportation sectors have the training needed to react in worst-case scenarios. The thwarted terrorist attack on a train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris last year underscores that mass transit continues to be a terrorist target. Mr. Speaker, these are only a few of the examples of provisions within this bill that will help to improve TSA operations and bolster the security of the American people. I urge support for this measure. I want to close by noting the bipartisan work that went into this legislation. There is still much to be done in the transportation security space, but the legislation before us represents a step in the right direction to address issues within the surface and aviation transportation sectors. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the issues addressed in H.R. 3584 are of vital concern to the safety of our Nation's security, and it is imperative that we send this bill to the Senate today. Congress cannot afford to wait to address critical issues that help advance and improve our security. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 3584, the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement Act, which would authorize, streamline, and identify efficiencies within the Transportation Security Administration. As a Senior Member of the Homeland Security Committee, I served as chair of this subcommittee and continue to support its work to improve transportation security. I currently serve as the Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. The work of the TSA is a front line Department of Homeland Security and it is not easy--it can in fact be very dangerous. Like many of my Colleagues, I recall the shooting incident at LAX last year that killed Gerardo Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty; and the machete attack at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport earlier this year that resulted in injuries to Senior Transportation Security Officer Carol Richel. Each day, TSA processes an average of 1.7 million passengers at more than 450 airports across the nation. In 2012, TSA screened 637,582,122 passengers. The Bush Intercontinental and the William P. Hobby Airports are essential hubs for domestic and international air travel for Houston and the region: Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. Hobby (HOU). More than 650 daily departures occur at IAH. IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger traffic. IAH has 12 all-cargo airlines handling more than 419,205 metric tons of cargo in 2012. I believe that Congress has not done all that it could to make employees' work easier--Sequestration, a government shutdown, and a delay in fully funding the Department of Homeland Security was not in the security interest of the nation. Reports issued by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) have identified shortcomings within the Agency, raising questions how effectively TSA is fulfilling its mission. Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful procedures, retaliation against whistleblowers, low morale, and security gaps within the Agency are causes for concern. Other issues related to inconsistent requirements between what is written and what employees are told is essential for them to successfully meet the agency's standards for good performance needs work. [[Page H830]] The need for attention to TSA administrative procedures and due process within the agency to backstop decisions regarding reprimands or negative actions toward employees can be an essential step in addressing some morale issues that are related to uncertainty regarding the successful performance of duties. In other words, the same conduct by persons holding the same level of responsibility or positions within an airport results in the same positive or negative outcome. TSA is charged with: The protection of America's transportation systems; monitoring the movement of people and supplies during their use of our transportation systems; and ensuring the effectiveness and integrity of government agencies. H.R. 3584, directs the TSA to: ensure that all screening of passengers and their accessible property will be done in a risk-based, intelligence-driven manner with consideration given to the privacy and civil liberties of such passengers; and operate the ``TSA PreCheck'' program in a manner that provides expedited screening for low-risk passengers and their accessible property based on a comprehensive and continuous analysis of factors. More needs to be done to support the men and women working on the front lines of our nation's domestic security and that includes those who work at the TSA. I will continue to seek out opportunities to promote the mission of the TSA and role that TSA professionals fill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3584, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

(2) enhanced engagement, either through the science and technology directorate of the department of homeland security or directly, with the in-q-tel program described in paragraph (1). the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from new york (mr. katko) and the gentlewoman from new jersey (mrs. watson coleman) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new york. general leave mr. katko. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? there was no objection. mr. katko. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 3584, the transportation security administration reform and improvement act. this critical bipartisan piece of legislation ensures several congressional oversight priorities for the transportation security administration are addressed, including the authorization of the precheck program, the advancement of risk-based security initiatives, the enhancement of aviation worker vetting, and the improvement of airport screening technologies. h.r. 3584 also takes numerous steps toward augmenting the effectiveness and efficiency of various tsa security programs within both the surface and aviation transportation sectors, and it requires the administrator to conduct an efficiency review of the entire agency. [[page h829]] since assuming the chairmanship of the subcommittee on transportation security at the beginning of this congress, i have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to conduct rigorous oversight of this troubled agency. this bill is a direct result of our bipartisan efforts, and i am pleased to stand before you and have the house consider this important legislation. if signed into law, this legislation will make a direct impact on the safety and security of the traveling public and america's transportation systems. in an era of pronounced and evolving threats to the homeland, congress must not wait to act in the best interests of transportation security. further, the often misdirected nature of the tsa requires that we, as legislators and overseers, fulfill our obligation to reform this fledgling agency into an intelligence-driven organization. when i came to congress, i pledged to my constituents that i would work hard to deliver results. i am proud of all the work the committee on homeland security has done over the past year. i am honored to have the privilege to sponsor so many pieces of legislation that are helping to keep our country safe. i would like to thank ranking member rice and ranking member thompson for their time and attention to this important piece of legislation. i would also like to thank the gentleman from texas (mr. mccaul), the chairman of the full committee, for his continued support of the subcommittee's oversight efforts and for ensuring important pieces of legislation, such as h.r. 3584, are considered on the house floor. the committee on homeland security's legislative results under the leadership of chairman mccaul and ranking member thompson are proof that, by working together in a bipartisan fashion, not only can we improve the security of our country, but we can demonstrate to the american people that congress can actually work together and deliver results. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume, and i rise in support of h.r. 3584, the transportation security administration reform and improvement act of 2015. mr. speaker, i am pleased that h.r. 3584 includes language authored by ranking member bennie thompson to direct tsa to move away from how it identifies low-risk passengers for expedited airport screening. in recent years, both the department of homeland security's inspector general and the comptroller general have been very critical about the security risks of the so-called managed inclusion process. in response, ranking member thompson introduced the securing expedited screening act, which was included in this measure. we all have an interest in tsa effectively managing airport screening. ensuring that a robust known-traveler program for low-risk travelers is built into tsa's concept of screening operations just makes sense. that is why i support the expansion of the precheck program, under which expedited screening is provided to travelers who have been fully vetted prior to arriving at the airport. i am pleased that h.r. 3584 includes provisions to expand the public's enrollment in the precheck program by, among other things, coordinating with the private sector to deploy tsa-approved online and mobile enrollment centers. another key to the effective management of airport screening is the maintenance of the security equipment. i am pleased that h.r. 3584 includes language authored by representative rice, the ranking member of the subcommittee on transportation security, to ensure that tsa puts in place systems to ensure that when it comes to security-related technologies at our nation's airports, timely maintenance is done and documented. according to the dhs inspector general, without proper maintenance and documentation thereof, the tsa could possibly have to resort to using alternate screening methods, which could lead to the traveling public being less safe. h.r. 3584 also includes language adopted in the full committee to help businesses, particularly small businesses, to be able to create innovative security technologies through public-private partnerships. {time} 1615 over the years, we have seen the limitations of various security technologies in use at our airports. it is crucial that innovators continue to push the envelope in terms of detection and mitigation capabilities. finally, as the representative of a jurisdiction that relies heavily on mass transit, i am pleased that the bill seeks to ensure that frontline workers in our transportation sectors have the training needed to react in worst-case scenarios. the thwarted terrorist attack on a train traveling from amsterdam to paris last year underscores that mass transit continues to be a terrorist target. mr. speaker, these are only a few of the examples of provisions within this bill that will help to improve tsa operations and bolster the security of the american people. i urge support for this measure. i want to close by noting the bipartisan work that went into this legislation. there is still much to be done in the transportation security space, but the legislation before us represents a step in the right direction to address issues within the surface and aviation transportation sectors. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. katko. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, the issues addressed in h.r. 3584 are of vital concern to the safety of our nation's security, and it is imperative that we send this bill to the senate today. congress cannot afford to wait to address critical issues that help advance and improve our security. i urge my colleagues to support the bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise to speak on h.r. 3584, the transportation security administration reform and improvement act, which would authorize, streamline, and identify efficiencies within the transportation security administration. as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i served as chair of this subcommittee and continue to support its work to improve transportation security. i currently serve as the ranking member on the house judiciary committee's subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations. the work of the tsa is a front line department of homeland security and it is not easy--it can in fact be very dangerous. like many of my colleagues, i recall the shooting incident at lax last year that killed gerardo hernandez, who became the first tsa officer killed in the line of duty; and the machete attack at the louis armstrong new orleans international airport earlier this year that resulted in injuries to senior transportation security officer carol richel. each day, tsa processes an average of 1.7 million passengers at more than 450 airports across the nation. in 2012, tsa screened 637,582,122 passengers. the bush intercontinental and the william p. hobby airports are essential hubs for domestic and international air travel for houston and the region: nearly 40 million passengers traveled through bush intercontinental airport (iah) and an additional 10 million traveled through william p. hobby (hou). more than 650 daily departures occur at iah. iah is the 11th busiest airport in the u.s. for total passenger traffic. iah has 12 all-cargo airlines handling more than 419,205 metric tons of cargo in 2012. i believe that congress has not done all that it could to make employees' work easier--sequestration, a government shutdown, and a delay in fully funding the department of homeland security was not in the security interest of the nation. reports issued by the government accountability office (gao) and department of homeland security office of inspector general (oig) have identified shortcomings within the agency, raising questions how effectively tsa is fulfilling its mission. allegations about mismanagement, wasteful procedures, retaliation against whistleblowers, low morale, and security gaps within the agency are causes for concern. other issues related to inconsistent requirements between what is written and what employees are told is essential for them to successfully meet the agency's standards for good performance needs work. [[page h830]] the need for attention to tsa administrative procedures and due process within the agency to backstop decisions regarding reprimands or negative actions toward employees can be an essential step in addressing some morale issues that are related to uncertainty regarding the successful performance of duties. in other words, the same conduct by persons holding the same level of responsibility or positions within an airport results in the same positive or negative outcome. tsa is charged with: the protection of america's transportation systems; monitoring the movement of people and supplies during their use of our transportation systems; and ensuring the effectiveness and integrity of government agencies. h.r. 3584, directs the tsa to: ensure that all screening of passengers and their accessible property will be done in a risk-based, intelligence-driven manner with consideration given to the privacy and civil liberties of such passengers; and operate the ``tsa precheck'' program in a manner that provides expedited screening for low-risk passengers and their accessible property based on a comprehensive and continuous analysis of factors. more needs to be done to support the men and women working on the front lines of our nation's domestic security and that includes those who work at the tsa. i will continue to seek out opportunities to promote the mission of the tsa and role that tsa professionals fill. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. katko) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3584, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",60324
CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgH833,CREC-2016-02-23,114,FOREIGN FIGHTER REVIEW ACT OF 2016,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H833-H834] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOREIGN FIGHTER REVIEW ACT OF 2016 Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4402) to require a review of information regarding persons who have traveled or attempted to travel from the United States to support terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4402 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT REVIEW OF CERTAIN FOREIGN FIGHTERS. (a) Review.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President, acting through the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall initiate a review of known instances since 2011 in which a person has traveled or attempted to travel to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria from the United States to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. Such review shall-- (1) include relevant unclassified and classified information held by the United States Government related to each instance; (2) ascertain which factors, including operational issues, security vulnerabilities, systemic challenges, or other issues that may have undermined efforts to prevent the travel of such persons to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria from the United States, including the timely identification of suspects, information sharing, intervention, and interdiction; and (3) identify lessons learned and areas for improvement to prevent additional travel by such persons to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria, or other terrorist safe havens abroad, to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. (b) Information Sharing.--If necessary, the President shall direct the heads of relevant Federal agencies to provide the appropriate information necessary for the Secretary of Homeland Security to complete the review required under subsection (a). (c) Submission to Congress.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with the protection of classified information, submit to the appropriate congressional committees the results of the review required under subsection (a), which may include information on travel routes of greatest concern. (d) Prohibition on Additional Funding.--No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section. (e) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means-- (A) in the House of Representatives-- (i) the Committee on Homeland Security; (ii) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; (iii) the Committee on the Judiciary; (iv) the Committee on Armed Services; (v) the Committee on Foreign Affairs; (vi) the Committee on Financial Services; and (vii) the Committee on Appropriations; and (B) in the Senate-- (i) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; (ii) the Select Committee on Intelligence; (iii) the Committee on the Judiciary; (iv) the Committee on Armed Services; (v) the Committee on Foreign Relations; (vi) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; and (vii) the Committee on Appropriations. (2) Material support or resources.--The term ``material support or resources'' has the meaning given such term in section 2339A of title 18, United States Code. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there have been over 250 cases of Americans attempting to travel to Syria and Iraq in order to support terrorist groups since 2011. Overall, 85 percent of Westerners attempting to join groups like ISIS are succeeding without being apprehended by law enforcement officials. The ability to make it to a war zone has grave consequences. Those who have been radicalized gain firsthand knowledge and training, making them an even greater threat. There is a clear breakdown in our ability to identify and then prevent these individuals from leaving the country in the first place. That is why I introduced the Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016. The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to study and identify all known foreign fighter travel in an effort to highlight the specific challenges and impediments that law enforcement faces in its attempts to stop individuals from joining terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria. DHS should already be collecting this kind of data and conducting this type of analysis. The findings from this type of study are crucial to informing Congress on additional steps we can take to improve the security of our Nation. This was a key finding in the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, of which I was a member. It is imperative that we get the right information to the right people at the right time to catch those who have been radicalized before they leave the country, not after they have gained combat experience and returned to the homeland. The Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016 is the first step towards getting our law enforcement agencies the tools that they need to do just that. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4402, the Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4402 requires the President, through the Department of Homeland Security, to review information regarding persons who have traveled or attempted to travel from the United States to Syria and Iraq since 2011 to support terrorist organizations. This legislation reflects a recommendation issued by the Committee on Homeland Security's Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel in its final report. The report found that a large number of U.S. persons have been able to travel to dangerous terrorist safe havens in Iraq and Syria and return to the United States without interdiction. I believe there is a lot to be learned from the instances where we failed to interdict persons who traveled to terrorist safe havens. These ``lessons learned'' could reveal systematic weaknesses in our security programs and highlight areas for enhancements. While many Federal agencies have completed individual reviews of cases within their purview, a coordinated and comprehensive interagency after-action review has never been undertaken. H.R. 4402 would require just such a review. [[Page H834]] H.R. 4402 has the potential to strengthen coordination across the Federal Government to help prevent U.S. persons from exploiting vulnerabilities in our security apparatus to travel under the radar to terrorist camps and safe havens in the future. As such, Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4402. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko). Mr. KATKO. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. Speaker, after having spent much of the last year heading a bipartisan task force with the author of this bill, Mr. Hurd, it became clear that we are not winning the fight to keep Americans from being recruited by terrorist groups. The majority of our citizens who have tried to go to join ISIS have succeeded in doing so. They were not stopped by law enforcement. And while authorities have worked hard and have disrupted serious plots, we have got to do more to shut down the foreign fighter pipeline. On the House Homeland Security Committee, we are constantly briefed about the new threat streams, the soaring number of terror investigations here at home, and the Americans being lured to fight in places like Syria alongside ISIS. We cannot simply listen to this information and sit on our hands. We need to act. I commend my colleague for this bill and for implementing one of our important task force recommendations. We need to conduct a top-to-bottom review of instances where Americans were recruited to fight with jihadist groups abroad, and we need to figure out where we could have done more to stop it. This is why I rise in strong support of H.R. 4402, the Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016. This legislation will ensure that our government takes a hard look at how to better deter, detect, and disrupt terrorist travel, especially when it involves our own citizens. But this will not be some review that is ordered and then forgotten. The administration is required to return to Congress with the ``lessons learned'' from these recent cases so that we can fix the problem, rather than allow it to persist. My colleague has a wealth of knowledge that proved to be invaluable during the past year on the task force when we focused on these issues. I would like to conclude by thanking Mr. Hurd for his steadfast leadership, especially on national security issues. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I again urge passage of H.R. 4402, a bill that seeks to improve the Federal Government's understanding of the circumstances surrounding travel or attempted travel from the U.S. to terrorist safe havens in Syria and Iraq. Under this measure, the review is to be submitted to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The findings of that review have the potential to inform policymakers as we work to strengthen our ability to prevent travel to terrorist sanctuaries and terrorism at large. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4402. I would like to thank both the gentleman from New York for his leadership on the task force and my colleague from New Jersey for her work on the Homeland Security Committee. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4402 the ``Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016,'' which requires the president, acting through the Homeland Security Secretary, to initiate a review of known instances since 2011 in which a person has traveled or attempted to travel from the United States to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, I take seriously threats to the security of the homeland and our responsibility to put in place adequate measures to defeat them. That is why in the first session of this Congress I introduced H.R. 48 ``No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act,'' which reviews the completeness of the Terrorist Screening Database and the terrorist watch list utilized by the Transportation Security Administration. I support H.R. 4402 because it would evaluate any flaws in existing programs or procedures that aim to prevent such travel and identify ways to improve their effectiveness. Since 2011, more than 30,000 foreign fighters from over 100 different countries have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIL. In the last 18 months, the number of foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq has more than doubled. In the first six months of 2015, more than 7,000 foreign fighters have arrived in Syria and Iraq. According to a report issued last year by the Committee on Homeland Security's Foreign Fighter Task Force, U.S. officials apprehended less than 20 percent (28/250) of Americans who sought to travel to the region. The report also found that while information sharing had improved, there is currently no comprehensive global database of foreign fighters. It is estimated that at 250 persons who have traveled to Syria or Iraq to join ISIS hold American citizenship. Since these persons who identify with the terrorist aims of ISIS can leave and enter the United States, it is critically important that American customs and security officials have the most accurate and effective terrorist screening tools available. H.R. 4402 helps address this problem by identifying areas for improvement to prevent additional travel by ``Foreign Fighters'' to conflict zones in areas such as Iraq, Syria, or other terrorist safe havens abroad, to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. Specifically, H.R. 4402 directs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a review and report to the Congress on the following: 1. Relevant unclassified and classified information held by the U.S. government related to each instance: 2. The factors including operational issues, security vulnerabilities and systemic challenges that may have undermined efforts to prevent the travel of such persons to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria, including the timely identification of suspects, information sharing, intervention and interdiction. 3. The lessons learned and areas for improvement to prevent additional travel by such persons to conflict zones or other terrorist safe havens. The bill also requires the President to direct the heads of relevant federal agencies to provide to the Homeland Security Secretary the information needed to complete the review, which is due within 120 days of enactment. Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging that progress has been made in preventing individuals inspired by the Islamic State and other Islamic extremist groups to either travel to Syria and Iraq or carry out attacks on U.S. soil, but we need to do more and remain ever vigilant to protect the security of our homeland. H.R. 4402 is a positive step in the right direction and I urge all Members to support this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4402, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H833-H834] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOREIGN FIGHTER REVIEW ACT OF 2016 Mr. HURD of Texas.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there have been over 250 cases of Americans attempting to travel to Syria and Iraq in order to support terrorist groups since 2011. Overall, 85 percent of Westerners attempting to join groups like ISIS are succeeding without being apprehended by law enforcement officials. The ability to make it to a war zone has grave consequences. Those who have been radicalized gain firsthand knowledge and training, making them an even greater threat. There is a clear breakdown in our ability to identify and then prevent these individuals from leaving the country in the first place. That is why I introduced the Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016. The bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to study and identify all known foreign fighter travel in an effort to highlight the specific challenges and impediments that law enforcement faces in its attempts to stop individuals from joining terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria. DHS should already be collecting this kind of data and conducting this type of analysis. The findings from this type of study are crucial to informing Congress on additional steps we can take to improve the security of our Nation. This was a key finding in the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel, of which I was a member. It is imperative that we get the right information to the right people at the right time to catch those who have been radicalized before they leave the country, not after they have gained combat experience and returned to the homeland. The Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016 is the first step towards getting our law enforcement agencies the tools that they need to do just that. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4402, the Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4402 requires the President, through the Department of Homeland Security, to review information regarding persons who have traveled or attempted to travel from the United States to Syria and Iraq since 2011 to support terrorist organizations. This legislation reflects a recommendation issued by the Committee on Homeland Security's Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel in its final report. The report found that a large number of U.S. persons have been able to travel to dangerous terrorist safe havens in Iraq and Syria and return to the United States without interdiction. I believe there is a lot to be learned from the instances where we failed to interdict persons who traveled to terrorist safe havens. These ``lessons learned'' could reveal systematic weaknesses in our security programs and highlight areas for enhancements. While many Federal agencies have completed individual reviews of cases within their purview, a coordinated and comprehensive interagency after-action review has never been undertaken. H.R. 4402 would require just such a review. [[Page H834]] H.R. 4402 has the potential to strengthen coordination across the Federal Government to help prevent U.S. persons from exploiting vulnerabilities in our security apparatus to travel under the radar to terrorist camps and safe havens in the future. As such, Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 4402. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko). Mr. KATKO. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. Speaker, after having spent much of the last year heading a bipartisan task force with the author of this bill, Mr. Hurd, it became clear that we are not winning the fight to keep Americans from being recruited by terrorist groups. The majority of our citizens who have tried to go to join ISIS have succeeded in doing so. They were not stopped by law enforcement. And while authorities have worked hard and have disrupted serious plots, we have got to do more to shut down the foreign fighter pipeline. On the House Homeland Security Committee, we are constantly briefed about the new threat streams, the soaring number of terror investigations here at home, and the Americans being lured to fight in places like Syria alongside ISIS. We cannot simply listen to this information and sit on our hands. We need to act. I commend my colleague for this bill and for implementing one of our important task force recommendations. We need to conduct a top-to-bottom review of instances where Americans were recruited to fight with jihadist groups abroad, and we need to figure out where we could have done more to stop it. This is why I rise in strong support of H.R. 4402, the Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016. This legislation will ensure that our government takes a hard look at how to better deter, detect, and disrupt terrorist travel, especially when it involves our own citizens. But this will not be some review that is ordered and then forgotten. The administration is required to return to Congress with the ``lessons learned'' from these recent cases so that we can fix the problem, rather than allow it to persist. My colleague has a wealth of knowledge that proved to be invaluable during the past year on the task force when we focused on these issues. I would like to conclude by thanking Mr. Hurd for his steadfast leadership, especially on national security issues. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I again urge passage of H.R. 4402, a bill that seeks to improve the Federal Government's understanding of the circumstances surrounding travel or attempted travel from the U.S. to terrorist safe havens in Syria and Iraq. Under this measure, the review is to be submitted to Congress within 120 days of enactment. The findings of that review have the potential to inform policymakers as we work to strengthen our ability to prevent travel to terrorist sanctuaries and terrorism at large. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4402. I would like to thank both the gentleman from New York for his leadership on the task force and my colleague from New Jersey for her work on the Homeland Security Committee. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4402 the ``Foreign Fighter Review Act of 2016,'' which requires the president, acting through the Homeland Security Secretary, to initiate a review of known instances since 2011 in which a person has traveled or attempted to travel from the United States to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, I take seriously threats to the security of the homeland and our responsibility to put in place adequate measures to defeat them. That is why in the first session of this Congress I introduced H.R. 48 ``No Fly for Foreign Fighters Act,'' which reviews the completeness of the Terrorist Screening Database and the terrorist watch list utilized by the Transportation Security Administration. I support H.R. 4402 because it would evaluate any flaws in existing programs or procedures that aim to prevent such travel and identify ways to improve their effectiveness. Since 2011, more than 30,000 foreign fighters from over 100 different countries have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIL. In the last 18 months, the number of foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq has more than doubled. In the first six months of 2015, more than 7,000 foreign fighters have arrived in Syria and Iraq. According to a report issued last year by the Committee on Homeland Security's Foreign Fighter Task Force, U.S. officials apprehended less than 20 percent (28/250) of Americans who sought to travel to the region. The report also found that while information sharing had improved, there is currently no comprehensive global database of foreign fighters. It is estimated that at 250 persons who have traveled to Syria or Iraq to join ISIS hold American citizenship. Since these persons who identify with the terrorist aims of ISIS can leave and enter the United States, it is critically important that American customs and security officials have the most accurate and effective terrorist screening tools available. H.R. 4402 helps address this problem by identifying areas for improvement to prevent additional travel by ``Foreign Fighters'' to conflict zones in areas such as Iraq, Syria, or other terrorist safe havens abroad, to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. Specifically, H.R. 4402 directs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a review and report to the Congress on the following: 1. Relevant unclassified and classified information held by the U.S. government related to each instance: 2. The factors including operational issues, security vulnerabilities and systemic challenges that may have undermined efforts to prevent the travel of such persons to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria, including the timely identification of suspects, information sharing, intervention and interdiction. 3. The lessons learned and areas for improvement to prevent additional travel by such persons to conflict zones or other terrorist safe havens. The bill also requires the President to direct the heads of relevant federal agencies to provide to the Homeland Security Secretary the information needed to complete the review, which is due within 120 days of enactment. Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging that progress has been made in preventing individuals inspired by the Islamic State and other Islamic extremist groups to either travel to Syria and Iraq or carry out attacks on U.S. soil, but we need to do more and remain ever vigilant to protect the security of our homeland. H.R. 4402 is a positive step in the right direction and I urge all Members to support this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4402, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H833-H834] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOREIGN FIGHTER REVIEW ACT OF 2016 Mr. HURD of Texas.

terrorism at large. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. hurd of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i once again urge my colleagues to support h.r. 4402. i would like to thank both the gentleman from new york for his leadership on the task force and my colleague from new jersey for her work on the homeland security committee. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 4402 the ``foreign fighter review act of 2016,'' which requires the president, acting through the homeland security secretary, to initiate a review of known instances since 2011 in which a person has traveled or attempted to travel from the united states to a conflict zone in iraq or syria to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. as a senior member of the house committee on homeland security and the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security and investigations, i take seriously threats to the security of the homeland and our responsibility to put in place adequate measures to defeat them. that is why in the first session of this congress i introduced h.r. 48 ``no fly for foreign fighters act,'' which reviews the completeness of the terrorist screening database and the terrorist watch list utilized by the transportation security administration. i support h.r. 4402 because it would evaluate any flaws in existing programs or procedures that aim to prevent such travel and identify ways to improve their effectiveness. since 2011, more than 30,000 foreign fighters from over 100 different countries have traveled to syria and iraq to fight for isil. in the last 18 months, the number of foreign fighters traveling to syria and iraq has more than doubled. in the first six months of 2015, more than 7,000 foreign fighters have arrived in syria and iraq. according to a report issued last year by the committee on homeland security's foreign fighter task force, u.s. officials apprehended less than 20 percent (28/250) of americans who sought to travel to the region. the report also found that while information sharing had improved, there is currently no comprehensive global database of foreign fighters. it is estimated that at 250 persons who have traveled to syria or iraq to join isis hold american citizenship. since these persons who identify with the terrorist aims of isis can leave and enter the united states, it is critically important that american customs and security officials have the most accurate and effective terrorist screening tools available. h.r. 4402 helps address this problem by identifying areas for improvement to prevent additional travel by ``foreign fighters'' to conflict zones in areas such as iraq, syria, or other terrorist safe havens abroad, to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. specifically, h.r. 4402 directs the secretary of the department of homeland security to conduct a review and report to the congress on the following: 1. relevant unclassified and classified information held by the u.s. government related to each instance: 2. the factors including operational issues, security vulnerabilities and systemic challenges that may have undermined efforts to prevent the travel of such persons to a conflict zone in iraq or syria, including the timely identification of suspects, information sharing, intervention and interdiction. 3. the lessons learned and areas for improvement to prevent additional travel by such persons to conflict zones or other terrorist safe havens. the bill also requires the president to direct the heads of relevant federal agencies to provide to the homeland security secretary the information needed to complete the review, which is due within 120 days of enactment. mr. speaker, it is encouraging that progress has been made in preventing individuals inspired by the islamic state and other islamic extremist groups to either travel to syria and iraq or carry out attacks on u.s. soil, but we need to do more and remain ever vigilant to protect the security of our homeland. h.r. 4402 is a positive step in the right direction and i urge all members to support this important legislation. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. hurd) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4402, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. hurd of texas. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",15208
CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgH830,CREC-2016-02-23,114,NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COMBAT TERRORIST TRAVEL ACT OF 2016,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H830-H831] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COMBAT TERRORIST TRAVEL ACT OF 2016 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4408) to require the development of a national strategy to combat terrorist travel, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4408 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COMBAT TERRORIST TRAVEL. (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it should be the policy of the United States to-- (1) continue to regularly assess the evolving terrorist threat to the United States; (2) catalogue existing Federal Government efforts to obstruct terrorist and foreign fighter travel into, out of, and within the United States, as well as overseas; (3) identify such efforts that may benefit from reform or consolidation, or require elimination; (4) identify potential security vulnerabilities in United States defenses against terrorist travel; and (5) prioritize resources to address in a risk-based manner any such security vulnerabilities.

(e) Prohibition on Additional Funding.--No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section. (f) Definition.--In this section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means-- (1) in the House of Representatives-- (A) the Committee on Homeland Security; (B) the Committee on Armed Services; (C) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; (D) the Committee on the Judiciary; (E) the Committee on Foreign Affairs; and (F) the Committee on Appropriations; and (2) in the Senate-- (A) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; (B) the Committee on Armed Services; (C) the Select Committee on Intelligence; (D) the Committee on the Judiciary; (E) the Committee on Foreign Relations; and (F) the Committee on Appropriations. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as a former Federal prosecutor, I have spent much of my life focusing on keeping Americans safe; but when I assumed office, I was taken aback by the lack of a coherent strategy to stop terrorists from infiltrating our country and to keep Americans from being lured to fight with jihadists overseas. That is why I gladly accepted the opportunity to lead the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel. I worked closely with my colleagues to identify our Nation's top vulnerabilities and to close them quickly. Last September, we issued the Task Force's final report, marking the most [[Page H831]] extensive public review since the 9/11 Commission of U.S. efforts to fight foreign terrorist travel. We made 32 key findings and more than 50 recommendations in that report for enhancing our security. I am proud to say that, as of today, we have acted on almost half of those already, including with several of the bills we are considering today. H.R. 4408 would implement one of our top recommendations. It would require the President to send to Congress a National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel and an actionable plan to implement it. It has been nearly 10 years since the White House produced such a strategy, and since then, the threat has changed dramatically. Terror has gone viral, and violent extremists are recruiting at the speed of a re-tweet. The consequences for U.S. and international security have been enormous. We have seen terrorist groups balloon into terrorist microstates capable of fielding their own armies. In fact, today in Syria and Iraq, we are witnessing the largest convergence of Islamist terrorists in history. Reports indicate nearly 40,000 individuals from more than 120 countries have traveled there to join jihadist groups, including thousands from Western countries, like the United States. Many of these individuals have easy access to our country and could potentially return undetected to launch attacks, just as we saw happen in Paris. Yet, many of the counterterrorism programs we created after 9/11 are not suited for this new era and have not kept pace with the evolving threat. What is worse, there is no regular process in place in the executive branch for reviewing all of our defenses against terrorist travel to find security gaps and develop a plan to close them. Agencies are operating without clear, strategic guidance, and programs to counter terrorist travel are often not fully coordinated across the government spectrum. The result is that not only are we at greater risk that terrorists will slip through the cracks, but we also are at greater risk of government waste, overlap, and duplication. This bill would force the administration to assess all of the efforts in place to stop terrorists from crossing borders, streamline them, identify security gaps, and prioritize taxpayer dollars where they are needed most. It would also, for the first time ever, require the White House to produce a plan for intercepting foreign fighters. After 9/11, we spent a lot of time focused on keeping terrorists from getting into our country, but we did not spend enough time focused on stopping terrorists from recruiting our citizens to leave it and become overseas operatives. Once they travel to terrorist safe havens, these individuals become a triple threat. They strengthen jihadist groups on the ground, incite followers back home to conduct attacks, and can return battle-hardened and prepared to carry out their own acts of violence on their homeland. Make no mistake: we are at war. ISIS has already been linked to nearly 75 plots against the West, including more than 20 against the U.S. homeland. Our adversaries are clearly dead set on attacking this country. We need to show the American people that we are dead set on defending it. I am proud of the bipartisan work of the task force and grateful for the close collaboration of Mr. Keating, Mr. Payne, and Ms. Loretta Sanchez of California on the Democratic side. I would like to especially thank Mr. Vela for his continued support and significant contributions. I am, of course, indebted to my Republican colleagues on the task force for their hard work as well. I also want to thank my personal office assistant Tim Wang and committee staff Tyler Lowe and Katy Flynn for their excellent work on this as well. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4408, the National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel Act of 2016. H.R. 4408 requires the development of a national strategy to combat terrorist travel by bolstering efforts to intercept terrorists and foreign fighters, while also constraining their domestic and international travel. I applaud the work of the Committee on Homeland Security's Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel. One of the many findings of the task force's final report was that it has been a decade since the executive branch produced a government-wide plan to constrain terrorist travel. In the years since the issuance of the last government-wide plan in 2006, many programs aimed at restricting or preventing terrorist travel have changed or ended and new programs have been created. The task force found that hundreds of programs, projects, and initiatives have sprouted up to combat terrorist travel since 9/11, but there is no overarching strategy to coordinate them. Importantly, H.R. 4408 requires that the strategy include an updated, full accounting and description of America's terror travel preventative and protective measures. This accounting should provide a valuable baseline for future efforts to prevent terrorist travel. H.R. 4408 requires the President to submit to Congress a national strategy focused on disrupting and intercepting terrorists and foreign fighters. The strategy is to include an accounting of all U.S. Government programs to constrain terrorist travel, identify gaps and how they will be closed, and describe actions to eliminate waste, overlap, and duplication of efforts. The evolving nature of the terrorist threat demands a whole-of- government approach. A national strategy with implementation plans for each Federal agency involved, as H.R. 4408 requires, has the potential to deliver real security advances. As such, I support H.R. 4408, and I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, H.R. 4408. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4408, as amended. The question was taken.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as a former Federal prosecutor, I have spent much of my life focusing on keeping Americans safe; but when I assumed office, I was taken aback by the lack of a coherent strategy to stop terrorists from infiltrating our country and to keep Americans from being lured to fight with jihadists overseas. That is why I gladly accepted the opportunity to lead the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel. I worked closely with my colleagues to identify our Nation's top vulnerabilities and to close them quickly. Last September, we issued the Task Force's final report, marking the most [[Page H831]] extensive public review since the 9/11 Commission of U.S. efforts to fight foreign terrorist travel. We made 32 key findings and more than 50 recommendations in that report for enhancing our security. I am proud to say that, as of today, we have acted on almost half of those already, including with several of the bills we are considering today. H.R. 4408 would implement one of our top recommendations. It would require the President to send to Congress a National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel and an actionable plan to implement it. It has been nearly 10 years since the White House produced such a strategy, and since then, the threat has changed dramatically. Terror has gone viral, and violent extremists are recruiting at the speed of a re-tweet. The consequences for U.S. and international security have been enormous. We have seen terrorist groups balloon into terrorist microstates capable of fielding their own armies. In fact, today in Syria and Iraq, we are witnessing the largest convergence of Islamist terrorists in history. Reports indicate nearly 40,000 individuals from more than 120 countries have traveled there to join jihadist groups, including thousands from Western countries, like the United States. Many of these individuals have easy access to our country and could potentially return undetected to launch attacks, just as we saw happen in Paris. Yet, many of the counterterrorism programs we created after 9/11 are not suited for this new era and have not kept pace with the evolving threat. What is worse, there is no regular process in place in the executive branch for reviewing all of our defenses against terrorist travel to find security gaps and develop a plan to close them. Agencies are operating without clear, strategic guidance, and programs to counter terrorist travel are often not fully coordinated across the government spectrum. The result is that not only are we at greater risk that terrorists will slip through the cracks, but we also are at greater risk of government waste, overlap, and duplication. This bill would force the administration to assess all of the efforts in place to stop terrorists from crossing borders, streamline them, identify security gaps, and prioritize taxpayer dollars where they are needed most. It would also, for the first time ever, require the White House to produce a plan for intercepting foreign fighters. After 9/11, we spent a lot of time focused on keeping terrorists from getting into our country, but we did not spend enough time focused on stopping terrorists from recruiting our citizens to leave it and become overseas operatives. Once they travel to terrorist safe havens, these individuals become a triple threat. They strengthen jihadist groups on the ground, incite followers back home to conduct attacks, and can return battle-hardened and prepared to carry out their own acts of violence on their homeland. Make no mistake: we are at war. ISIS has already been linked to nearly 75 plots against the West, including more than 20 against the U.S. homeland. Our adversaries are clearly dead set on attacking this country. We need to show the American people that we are dead set on defending it. I am proud of the bipartisan work of the task force and grateful for the close collaboration of Mr. Keating, Mr. Payne, and Ms. Loretta Sanchez of California on the Democratic side. I would like to especially thank Mr. Vela for his continued support and significant contributions. I am, of course, indebted to my Republican colleagues on the task force for their hard work as well. I also want to thank my personal office assistant Tim Wang and committee staff Tyler Lowe and Katy Flynn for their excellent work on this as well. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4408, the National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel Act of 2016. H.R. 4408 requires the development of a national strategy to combat terrorist travel by bolstering efforts to intercept terrorists and foreign fighters, while also constraining their domestic and international travel. I applaud the work of the Committee on Homeland Security's Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel. One of the many findings of the task force's final report was that it has been a decade since the executive branch produced a government-wide plan to constrain terrorist travel. In the years since the issuance of the last government-wide plan in 2006, many programs aimed at restricting or preventing terrorist travel have changed or ended and new programs have been created. The task force found that hundreds of programs, projects, and initiatives have sprouted up to combat terrorist travel since 9/11, but there is no overarching strategy to coordinate them. Importantly, H.R. 4408 requires that the strategy include an updated, full accounting and description of America's terror travel preventative and protective measures. This accounting should provide a valuable baseline for future efforts to prevent terrorist travel. H.R. 4408 requires the President to submit to Congress a national strategy focused on disrupting and intercepting terrorists and foreign fighters. The strategy is to include an accounting of all U.S. Government programs to constrain terrorist travel, identify gaps and how they will be closed, and describe actions to eliminate waste, overlap, and duplication of efforts. The evolving nature of the terrorist threat demands a whole-of- government approach. A national strategy with implementation plans for each Federal agency involved, as H.R. 4408 requires, has the potential to deliver real security advances. As such, I support H.R. 4408, and I urge its passage. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, H.R. 4408. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4408, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,14122,14122,14193,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [house] [pages h830-h831] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] national strategy to combat terrorist travel act of 2016 mr. katko. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 4408) to require the development of a national strategy to combat terrorist travel, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 4408 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``national strategy to combat terrorist travel act of 2016''. sec. 2. national strategy to combat terrorist travel.

The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4398 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION DOCUMENTATION. (a) In General.--Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 708. ACQUISITION DOCUMENTATION. ``(a) In General.--For each major acquisition program, the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Management, shall require the head of a relevant component or office to-- ``(1) maintain acquisition documentation that is complete, accurate, timely, and valid and that includes, at a minimum-- ``(A) operational requirements that are validated consistent with Departmental policy and changes to those requirements, as appropriate; ``(B) a complete lifecycle cost estimate with supporting documentation; ``(C) verification of the lifecycle cost estimate against independent cost estimates, and reconciliation of any differences; ``(D) a cost-benefit analysis with supporting documentation; and ``(E) a schedule, including, as appropriate, an integrated master schedule; ``(2) prepare cost estimates and schedules for major acquisition programs, as required [[Page H832]] under subparagraphs (B) and (E), in a manner consistent with best practices as identified by the Comptroller General of the United States; and ``(3) submit certain acquisition documentation to the Secretary to produce an annual comprehensive report on the status of departmental acquisitions for submission to Congress. ``(b) Waiver.--On a case-by-case basis, the Secretary may waive the requirement under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) for a fiscal year if either-- ``(1) the program has not-- ``(A) entered the full rate production phase in the acquisition lifecycle; ``(B) had a reasonable cost estimate established; and ``(C) had a system configuration defined fully; or ``(2) the program does not meet the definition of capital asset, as such term is defined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. ``(c) Congressional Oversight.--At the same time the President's budget is submitted for a fiscal year under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary shall make information available, as applicable, to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate information on the requirement under subsection (a) in the prior fiscal year that includes the following specific information regarding each program for which the Secretary has issued a waiver under subsection (b): ``(1) The grounds for granting a waiver for that program. ``(2) The projected cost of that program. ``(3) The proportion of a component's or office's annual acquisition budget attributed to that program, as available. ``(4) Information on the significance of the program with respect to the component's operations and execution of its mission. ``(d) Major Acquisition Program Defined.--In this section, the term `major acquisition program' means a Department acquisition program that is estimated by the Secretary to require an eventual total expenditure of at least $300,000,000 (based on fiscal year 2016 constant dollars) over its lifecycle cost.''.

Acquisition documentation.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4398, the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act. This legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to improve management of its major purchases of systems to secure the border, better screen travelers, protect our shores, and other vital missions. Too often DHS has failed to document what these programs will cost, when they will be complete, and what they will deliver. It is unacceptable to spend billions of taxpayer dollars and not document this important information. H.R. 4398 will help our committee and congressional watchdogs hold the Department accountable, and ensure taxpayers dollars are being spent in an efficient and effective manner. This bill uses language similar to H.R. 3572, the DHS Headquarters Reform and Improvement Act, which also includes language that would comprehensively reform DHS' acquisition process. H.R. 3572 passed the House unanimously in October of last year, but has yet to be acted upon in the Senate. This important, bipartisan legislation will improve the oversight and management of billions of taxpayer dollars. It would empower DHS leaders to hold programs accountable, increase transparency for Congress, and require DHS to articulate a roadmap for how it spends billion of dollars to secure America. Safeguarding Americans' hard-earned taxpayer dollars is why our constituents sent us to Washington. I urge the Senate to act swiftly on these bills to improve the management of the Department of Homeland Security. I commend Ranking Member Watson Coleman for her leadership on this issue, and I ask all Members to join me in support of this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4398, the DHS Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act of 2016. I introduced this legislation to ensure that, when it comes to managing acquisitions, the Department of Homeland Security gets the fundamentals right. H.R. 4398 would require ``complete, accurate, timely, and valid'' documentation to be maintained for each of the Department's major acquisition programs. A major acquisition program is defined as one with a life-cycle cost estimated at $300 million or more. Later this week, the subcommittee on which I serve as ranking member will be conducting an oversight hearing about an acquisition that is, to my mind, a textbook case of why my legislation is so critical. After more than 12 years of effort at delivering a Department-wide human resource IT system and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, DHS has virtually nothing to show for it. {time} 1630 That acquisition, the Human Resource Information Technology program, or HRIT, lacked basic acquisition documentation, including a valid cost estimate and schedule. Under H.R. 4398, DHS would have to maintain current cost estimates and schedules for major acquisition programs. These sources of critical information for acquisition decisionmakers would have to conform to best practices, as identified by the Government Accountability Office. Additionally, each component head within DHS would be obligated to submit acquisition documentation to the Secretary for the production of an annual comprehensive report to Congress on the status of the acquisition. Under H.R. 4398, the Secretary could only waive these requirements in very limited circumstances. Mr. Speaker, for the reasons I have outlined here, I urge support for H.R. 4398. Mr. Speaker, anything less than an up-to-date acquisition documentation increases the odds of cost and schedule overruns. It also risks delayed delivery of critical capabilities and wastefully depletes resources that could be put to better use to protect the homeland. The Homeland Security Committee favorably reported H.R. 4398 on February 2 by a unanimous vote, and I thank my colleague for being a part of that. The fact that this legislation is cosponsored by Representatives McCaul and Thompson, the chairman and ranking member of our committee, reflects a strong commitment to bolstering the effectiveness of DHS acquisition programs. I urge passage of H.R. 4398, a bill that will help ensure that DHS is a good steward of taxpayer dollars and can provide DHS operators in the field with the tools they need to protect the American people. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4398. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4398, ``DHS Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act of 2016.'' I support this bill because it requires the DHS to produce cost estimates and schedules for all major acquisition programs and to maintain complete and accurate documentation of these projects. Specifically, for all programs expected to cost $300 million or more over its lifecycle, the department must maintain complete, accurate, timely and valid acquisition documentation. This bill will set a standard for all programs under DHS to follow and will save programs money and time. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed 22 major programs in DHS and out of 22 major programs: 1. GAO was unable to access six programs (including four in Customs and Border Protection). 2. The remaining 14 programs experienced schedule slips and cost growths. On average, these program milestones slipped more than three and a half year, and their life-cycle cost estimates increased by $9.7 billion, or 18 percent. [[Page H833]] As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I believe this act will maintain a standard across the board for programs to follow the Government Accountability Office's (GAO's) best practices. The Department of Homeland Security is constantly changing to fit the needs of our ever-changing world and there is a need of transparency between the DHS and GAO. This bill further requires that cost estimates and schedules for major acquisition programs be consistent with best practices as identified by GAO. Finally this bill limits the Secretary's authority to waive acquisition documentation requirements for a report to Congress on the status of major acquisition programs. This sets forth narrow conditions where waivers could be granted for a fiscal year, and requiring the Secretary to report annually to the Congressional homeland-security committees on each use of waiver authority during the preceding fiscal year. This bill creates an accountability model for the DHS which creates transparency between GAO and DHS and saves programs time and money, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4398. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H831-H833] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DHS ACQUISITION DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY ACT OF 2016 Mr. KATKO.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4398, the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act. This legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to improve management of its major purchases of systems to secure the border, better screen travelers, protect our shores, and other vital missions. Too often DHS has failed to document what these programs will cost, when they will be complete, and what they will deliver. It is unacceptable to spend billions of taxpayer dollars and not document this important information.

taxpayer dollars is why our constituents sent us to washington. i urge the senate to act swiftly on these bills to improve the management of the department of homeland security. i commend ranking member watson coleman for her leadership on this issue, and i ask all members to join me in support of this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 4398, the dhs acquisition documentation integrity act of 2016. i introduced this legislation to ensure that, when it comes to managing acquisitions, the department of homeland security gets the fundamentals right. h.r. 4398 would require ``complete, accurate, timely, and valid'' documentation to be maintained for each of the department's major acquisition programs. a major acquisition program is defined as one with a life-cycle cost estimated at $300 million or more. later this week, the subcommittee on which i serve as ranking member will be conducting an oversight hearing about an acquisition that is, to my mind, a textbook case of why my legislation is so critical. after more than 12 years of effort at delivering a department-wide human resource it system and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, dhs has virtually nothing to show for it. {time} 1630 that acquisition, the human resource information technology program, or hrit, lacked basic acquisition documentation, including a valid cost estimate and schedule. under h.r. 4398, dhs would have to maintain current cost estimates and schedules for major acquisition programs. these sources of critical information for acquisition decisionmakers would have to conform to best practices, as identified by the government accountability office. additionally, each component head within dhs would be obligated to submit acquisition documentation to the secretary for the production of an annual comprehensive report to congress on the status of the acquisition. under h.r. 4398, the secretary could only waive these requirements in very limited circumstances. mr. speaker, for the reasons i have outlined here, i urge support for h.r. 4398. mr. speaker, anything less than an up-to-date acquisition documentation increases the odds of cost and schedule overruns. it also risks delayed delivery of critical capabilities and wastefully depletes resources that could be put to better use to protect the homeland. the homeland security committee favorably reported h.r. 4398 on february 2 by a unanimous vote, and i thank my colleague for being a part of that. the fact that this legislation is cosponsored by representatives mccaul and thompson, the chairman and ranking member of our committee, reflects a strong commitment to bolstering the effectiveness of dhs acquisition programs. i urge passage of h.r. 4398, a bill that will help ensure that dhs is a good steward of taxpayer dollars and can provide dhs operators in the field with the tools they need to protect the american people. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. katko. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i once again urge my colleagues to support h.r. 4398. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 4398, ``dhs acquisition documentation integrity act of 2016.'' i support this bill because it requires the dhs to produce cost estimates and schedules for all major acquisition programs and to maintain complete and accurate documentation of these projects. specifically, for all programs expected to cost $300 million or more over its lifecycle, the department must maintain complete, accurate, timely and valid acquisition documentation. this bill will set a standard for all programs under dhs to follow and will save programs money and time. government accountability office (gao) reviewed 22 major programs in dhs and out of 22 major programs: 1. gao was unable to access six programs (including four in customs and border protection). 2. the remaining 14 programs experienced schedule slips and cost growths. on average, these program milestones slipped more than three and a half year, and their life-cycle cost estimates increased by $9.7 billion, or 18 percent. [[page h833]] as a member of the homeland security committee, i believe this act will maintain a standard across the board for programs to follow the government accountability office's (gao's) best practices. the department of homeland security is constantly changing to fit the needs of our ever-changing world and there is a need of transparency between the dhs and gao. this bill further requires that cost estimates and schedules for major acquisition programs be consistent with best practices as identified by gao. finally this bill limits the secretary's authority to waive acquisition documentation requirements for a report to congress on the status of major acquisition programs. this sets forth narrow conditions where waivers could be granted for a fiscal year, and requiring the secretary to report annually to the congressional homeland-security committees on each use of waiver authority during the preceding fiscal year. this bill creates an accountability model for the dhs which creates transparency between gao and dhs and saves programs time and money, i urge my colleagues to support this bill. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. katko) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4398. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",11892

Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, Michigan has had some tough times lately-- Flint and now Kalamazoo--which was rocked this past weekend by terrible random acts of violence that took six lives. I rise today with my Michigan colleagues to offer support and encouragement for the victims' friends and families. We should continue to keep them in our hearts and in our minds. I want to thank the countless folks on the front lines who helped prevent this tragedy from, yes, even being worse. The swift actions of those on the ground deserve to be commended, particularly the Kalamazoo Sheriff's Department, led by Sheriff Richard Fuller, Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley, and Mayor Bobby Hopewell. I ask my colleagues and those who hear this message across the country to pray for the families of the six victims and the recovery of the two injured, including 14-year-old Abigail Kopf of Battle Creek, who is fighting for her life, and Tiana Carruthers of Richland Township, who put herself in front of two children and was shot multiple times. It is heartbreaking, but we know that our Kalamazoo community can and will recover from this tragedy. We will never forget what happened. We remember the lives of Mary Lou Nye of Baroda; Mary Jo Nye, Dorothy Brown, and Barbara Hawthorne of Battle Creek; and Tyler Smith and his dad, Richard Smith, of Mattawan. This tragedy will not define us, it will not divide us, and it will not defeat us. We are Kalamazoo. I ask that the House pause for a moment of silence in honor of those impacted by the tragic events in Kalamazoo.

Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Eden Prairie Girls Hockey Team for winning the Minnesota High School State championship last weekend. The Eagles prevailed in a tight contest over Maple Grove in the title game when Lauren Eberle scored the game-winning goal in overtime. The 3-2 victory marks the third State title for Eden Prairie in the last 11 years. Eden Prairie was led by goals from Anna Gravelle and Rachel Werdin, along with a strong performance between the pipes by Alexa Dobchuk. Madam Speaker, it takes commitment, it takes hard work, and it takes teamwork and dedication to achieve a State championship.

The story says that, during this robbery, he attempted to respond to the killer's demands. In spite of that, he was gunned down--murdered. We have listened to the sad but eloquent comments of our colleagues from Michigan of vicious gun violence--of a person with 11 guns in his home. Yes, as many say, people kill; guns don't--but they use guns to kill. It is time for this Congress, as many police officers have said to me, to get its hands around the rampage of guns and gun violence, of senseless killings, of bad guys--some good guys--killing people with guns. It is important to close the gun show loophole, to be able to use and to demand science and safety restraints. I am appalled, but I am outraged.

So, when taken as a whole, nearly 1 in 10 Americans are living with a rare disease. Nearly 50 percent of those, Mr. Speaker, are children with rare diseases. How tragic. The Guardian Hands Foundation continues to raise awareness about the unique experiences of South Floridians impacted by rare diseases, and it serves as an important voice of hope and inspiration for families across our area. So please come and enjoy some wonderful exercise this weekend. Join our community at the 3rd Annual Walk Against Rare Diseases. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Page H838] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING GUARDIAN HANDS FOUNDATION'S 3RD ANNUAL WALK AGAINST RARE DISEASES (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is our first opportunity to remember and honor the life and legacy of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, with a further tribute tonight by Congresswoman Barbara Comstock of Virginia. I am grateful for Justice Scalia's lifetime of service to our country and his dedication to protecting and defending the Constitution. In the nearly three decades he served on the Supreme Court, he was renowned for his brilliant opinion, sharp wit, and engaging debate with attorneys. His dedication to a strict interpretation of the Constitution never wavered, and he was beloved by his colleagues on the Court. He promoted the real constitutional intent, for judges to interpret the law, not legislating undermining democracy. Nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and confirmed unanimously by the Senate, Justice Scalia was the Court's voice for opinions that upheld conservative values, such as the District of Columbia v. Heller, defending the right to bear arms by the Second Amendment. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Maureen, their children, and grandchildren. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Page H838] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

You can get it screened at your doctor's office and drugstores. You could even check it yourself at home using a home blood pressure monitor. The CDC and their Million Hearts effort is aiming to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes in the United States by 2017. To do that, they are encouraging Americans to make control their goal.

The President, however, continues to try to move forward on this in spite of vocal American opposition and bipartisan legislation that this Congress has passed and that this President has signed into law which prohibits bringing these known terrorists onto American soil and closing the facility in Cuba. Mr. Speaker, nothing changes today. We will not put our national security at risk. We will not unilaterally disarm ourselves in the war on terror, voluntarily giving up intelligence-gathering capabilities and putting our communities in the cross-hairs of terrorists. What we simply ask is that the President, as Commander in Chief, execute the law and follow the Constitution. That's why, as a Congress, we must stand up and do everything in our power to stop the administration's transfer of these terrorists to American soil and to stop the President from closing the Guantanamo Bay facility. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,1626,1626,1697,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [house] [page h839] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] guantanamo bay (mr. yoder asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. yoder. mr. speaker, i rise today on behalf of the safety and security of every single american, and i stand in opposition to the president's plan to close the detention facility at guantanamo bay, cuba. let me be clear. bringing the world's most dangerous terrorists to fort leavenworth, kansas, or anywhere in the united states is a request that congress cannot and shall not honor. the president, however, continues to try to move forward on this in spite of vocal american opposition and bipartisan legislation that this congress has passed and that this president has signed into law which prohibits bringing these known terrorists onto american soil and closing the facility in cuba. mr. speaker, nothing changes today. we will not put our national security at risk. we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves in the war on terror, voluntarily giving up intelligence-gathering capabilities and putting our communities in the cross-hairs of terrorists. what we simply ask is that the president, as commander in chief, execute the law and follow the constitution. that's why, as a congress, we must stand up and do everything in our power to stop the administration's transfer of these terrorists to american soil and to stop the president from closing the guantanamo bay facility. ____________________",1626
CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgH839-3,CREC-2016-02-23,114,HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H839-H843] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poliquin). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this Special Order is meant to honor the life and three decades of service of Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia was a person of great joy, great intellect, great wit, and great faith. Our Nation suffered a tremendous loss on February 13 with the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. My husband Chip and I, my parents, and our children are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend, our neighbor, and, of course, a legal legend. He was a courageous advocate for the rule of law and the Constitution. Justice Scalia and his wife, Maureen, raised an incredible family of 9 children and 36 grandchildren, and we have been so privileged to know and love them. Justice Scalia was both a larger-than-life Justice, who leaves a profound legacy in the law, as well as a down-to-earth husband, father, grandfather, and absolutely delightful friend who loved his Lord and God, his wife and family, the law, the opera, his country, hunting, and a good laugh. We have all heard the stories of his friendship across the ideological spectrum, none more famous than his friendship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Scalia explained: ``If you can't disagree ardently with your colleagues about some issues of law and yet personally still be friends, get another job, for Pete's sake.'' Justice Ginsburg explained: ``As annoyed as you might be about his zinging dissent, he's so utterly charming, so amusing, so sometimes outrageous, you can't help but say `I'm glad that he's my friend or he's my colleague.' '' Justice Scalia was a shining example of fidelity, as he was ever- faithful to his oath to the law, to his family, and to his God. He was celebrated by so many in the legal community. He was a revered mentor to the dozens and dozens of clerks who lined the steps of the Supreme Court last Friday in his honor. And every one of them, no doubt, had a story that had profound legal discussions in it but also ended with a good laugh. He simply will be irreplaceable and leaves a legacy that will be consequential, discussed, and debated for the ages. On the personal front, his life was also a great and consequential life. Justice Scalia married his wife of over 55 years, Maureen, in 1960. They were set up on a blind date. He told one author that Maureen was ``the product of the best decision I ever made.'' His nine children--nine, how appropriate for a Supreme Court Justice--were split five and four, five boys, four girls. They became lawyers, a priest, a poet, an Army major, and parents themselves of those wonderful 36 grandchildren. Justice Scalia proudly gave the lion's share of the credit for raising this large brood to the resourceful, talented, and very smart love of his life, Maureen, who, as her son Paul said in the homily, matched him at every step. Justice Scalia said about his children ``and there's not a dullard in the bunch.'' His son, Father Paul Scalia, was the celebrant for his father's beautiful funeral mass with the assistance of dozens of priests at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception this past Saturday. Father Paul began his moving homily saying: ``We are gathered here because of one man, a man known personally to many of us, known only by reputation to many more; a man loved by many, scorned by others; a man known for great controversy and for great compassion. That man, of course, is Jesus of Nazareth.'' [[Page H840]] {time} 1930 Father Paul continued: ``In the past week, many have recounted what Dad did for them. But here today we reflect what God did for Dad, how He blessed him.'' Father Paul explained how his father understood that the deeper he went into his Catholic faith, the better a citizen and public servant he became. That faith now inspires his children and grandchildren and generations to come of the Scalia family and the so many lives he touched and influenced. Justice Scalia also had a rich tenor voice that intimidated many who came before the Court in front of him, but as his son Christopher explained, it was also perfect for reading stories to his grandchildren. His rendition of ``The Night Before Christmas'' was an annual tradition. He also led many sing-alongs at parties, played the piano, and also that singing would go on and on for their long car rides. Pictures with his children and grandchildren cover the walls and the end tables and the piano of the Scalia home, and in any picture with one or more of those children or grandchildren or with his beloved Maureen, Justice Scalia would always be beaming whenever he was around his family. An only child himself, he loved that he gave his children the gift of many brothers and sisters. No doubt that is a great solace to all of them now, as well as a source of great strength and support for their mother. May God bless Justice Antonin Scalia, a good and faithful son, and may God bless his wife, Maureen, and their entire family, and the scores and scores of their friends and his colleagues and the millions more of admirers, and may God bless the country that he so loved. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I especially thank Congresswoman Comstock for leading this tribute to Justice Scalia. The Nation's legal lights faded recently with the loss of the great Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but they will not be dimmed for long, for Justice Scalia left a legacy of illumination that will continue far beyond his mortal years. Although Justice Scalia is no longer with us on Earth, his cogent, witty, and plain-spoken writings will continue to educate law students and good citizens everywhere for centuries to come. Justice Scalia was no mere legal technician. He was a deep thinker who had an uncommon knack for crystallizing powerful ideas into trenchant, lasting prose. The journey on which he led his readers was always a joy, always compelling, because Justice Scalia always made clear where the path started. He once said: ``More important than your obligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your conscience correctly.'' And for Justice Scalia, as with morality, so it was with the law. Justice Scalia always made sure he built his argument on a solid foundation: the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. As a strong defender of the rule of law, he was a gentle legal giant. Like all great educators, Justice Scalia was respectful of others, regardless of their differing views. ``I attack ideas,'' he once said. ``I don't attack people. And some very good people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate the two, you gotta get another day job.'' That is a life lesson for all of us who engage in any debates and the ideas that undergird them. In that spirit, Justice Scalia often said: ``My best buddy on the Court is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has always been,'' and Justice Ginsburg's moving tribute to her own best buddy should reduce every bitter partisan to tears. Throughout his life, Justice Scalia correctly inveighed against the notion of a living Constitution, the misguided idea that the Constitution's text and original meaning somehow shifted this way and that with changes in popular attitudes. Justice Scalia said: That's the argument of constitutional flexibility and it goes something like this: The Constitution is over 200 years old, and societies change. It has to change with society, like a living organism, or it will become brittle and break. But . . . the Constitution is not a living organism; it is a legal document. It says some things and doesn't say other things. As a lifetime-appointed Supreme Court Justice, Justice Scalia, like all other lifetime-appointed judges, had the opportunity to effectively alter the meaning of the Constitution if he wanted and could garner the support of four of his colleagues. But like George Washington refusing the crown offered him, Justice Scalia rejected the notion the Supreme Court should impose its own preferred policies on the country through strained constitutional interpretations. Instead, Justice Scalia was an ardent defender of democracy, representative democracy. As he said: ``If you think aficionados of a living Constitution want to bring you flexibility, think again. You think the death penalty is a good idea? Persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it. You want a right to abortion? Persuade your fellow citizens and enact it. That's flexibility.'' Justice Scalia's respect for article I of the Constitution, the article that begins with these words, ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives,'' that article, which clearly sets forth the powers of the Congress to legislate, not the executive branch and not the courts, is one of Justice Scalia's greatest legacies. As much as Justice Scalia will be remembered as an able critic of the notion of a living Constitution, he will be remembered for his own living dissents, and many majority opinions, which will live forever in the hearts and minds of lovers of the law in America and around the world. Thank you, Justice Scalia. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I yield to my friend, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from Virginia, Barbara Comstock, for organizing this Special Order and for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, Father Paul Scalia said in his beautiful eulogy of his father, Justice Antonin Scalia, on Saturday: ``We give thanks that Jesus brought him to new life in baptism, nourished him with the Eucharist, and healed him in the confessional. God blessed Dad with a deep Catholic faith, the conviction that Christ's presence and power continue in the world today through His body, the Church.'' Mr. Speaker, last week our country lost one of its most outspoken and dedicated defenders of faith and liberty. For nearly 30 years, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stood as a monument to a faith-based viewpoint on the Constitution that will be sorely missed. There is no one in the history of our country who better protected the original intent of our Constitution and upheld the God-given rights of all Americans than Justice Scalia. Shown by his fierce dedication to defending our Constitution, from protecting Americans from government intrusion to protecting the rights of the unborn, Justice Scalia was a man of conviction, a man of passion, and a man of integrity. His honor and vigilance toward the original meaning of the Constitution and his historic dissents will ring throughout history. Every single ounce of Justice Scalia's heart and soul was devoted to our country, his faith, and his family. His wit, his candor, and his character will be missed on our Nation's highest Court. The legacy of Justice Scalia must never be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, I stand committed today to ensure we continue to prioritize faith and freedom in this country, protecting our natural- born rights as citizens of the United States of America. It is simply the right thing to do. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry). Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. When I was informed of the Justice's death, it came across my electronic devices. I texted my wife back home, and I said: I just want to cry. I had the extraordinary privilege of getting to know the Justice on a more personal basis. In western Nebraska there is a large outcropping. It is called [[Page H841]] Chimney Rock. Chimney Rock was the place that marks the halfway point across America. When the settlers crossed the great country, when they got to Chimney Rock, they knew that they were halfway along their journey. In the shadow of that rock, just this last December, I was in a duck blind with Justice Scalia who, as we all know, had that as an avocation. When you spend a couple of days in a duck blind with somebody, it is a bonding experience. You get to know them more personally. In my own reflections about what Chimney Rock meant to the country, a bridge between the past and the future, I thought it appropriately captured the character, the nature, the wisdom of the great Justice. He was a great student of American history, our legal system, a great protector of the Constitution and precedents. He understood how important it was to act in a consistent manner with principle while looking forward and applying that principle in ever-changing circumstances of American life. Because he did so with continuity and with consistency, he was a man of great integrity. His inner voice matched his outer voice. When we saw this beautiful outpouring of support at his funeral from people all across the political aisle, I think the common narrative there was a deep respect for this great man. Mr. Speaker, when he died, I felt like America lost her grandfather. He was a soaring intellect, had an incisive wit, and had in a certain sense a humble personality. He loved to share a joke. For me to have the privilege of spending some time in a personal intimate setting with him I count as an extraordinary privilege of my time in public service. May God rest his soul. May God grant him peace. May God continue to bless the United States of America and give us all the strength to continue to think through how we are going to elevate and form the next generation of Americans who can apply themselves in such an extraordinary, sacrificial way as Justice Scalia did. I remember one other comment I wanted to leave with you. I remember when the Justice asked me: How many children do you have? You beautifully talked about how he was so devoted to his family and faith. He asked me, knowing that I knew he had nine, he asked me how many children. I said: I have five. He paused. He said: Respectable. That was it. I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for her beautiful remarks and for giving me this moment to honor this great American. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his lovely remarks. Five is a good start, right, getting to that nine. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King). Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I especially thank her for arranging this Special Order tonight in memory of Justice Scalia, who was truly a legal giant. He was a man who surpassed all of the intellects that I have been aware of in my lifetime. Certainly no one in the legal profession has demonstrated more of a love for the law, more respect for the law, and more respect for the original intent of the Constitution. Now, I have nowhere near the personal contact with Justice Scalia that the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) did or the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry). I did meet him on a number of occasions. I had the opportunity to speak with him. Usually our conversations consisted of talking about the fact that we lived in working class neighborhoods in Queens. We grew up about a mile apart from each other. We both attended Jesuit high schools. That is about where the comparison ended as far as the Jesuit high schools, because he was valedictorian and I was far from it. He was a person who had the strength of somebody from the neighborhood, but he had the scholar's intellect. {time} 1945 He had an intellect that went beyond tremendous intelligence. It was an intellect that was shaped and framed by his deep religious faith and a belief in undiminished, lasting, and immutable principles. That is what reflected throughout his opinions. Yet he never let his own feelings or prejudices influence his thinking. That was certainly proven in the flag burning case. If there is anyone who loved his country and would oppose the concept of the act of flag burning, it was Justice Scalia. Yet he upheld the act as an expression of free speech, as much as it pained him. Something that many of us in politics and government have a hard time doing is following the letter of the law, following the intent of the law, and following the meaning of the law. Somehow, we like to put in our own feelings and beliefs. The fact is Justice Scalia told us that there is a higher principle than that. Also he had such a respect for language. There were no easy words thrown about. There were no escape clauses or phrases. There was an intent and purpose and meaning to everything that he did. To read his opinions, whether in the majority--and knowing that he was in the majority made us feel much better--or in his dissents, you realized, again, how determined he was, how forceful he was, and how committed he was to arriving at the correct decision--one which, again, followed the original intent of the Constitution. There were several references by Barbara Comstock to his funeral service on Saturday. Again, it was an expression by so many people of their love and respect for such an outstanding human being, a person whom I doubt we will ever see the likes of again--certainly, in our lifetimes. He was a giant of the law. He was a giant of his faith. He was a giant of his country. I am proud to join with all of my colleagues tonight--especially Barbara Comstock, who arranged this Special Order-- in honoring the memory of Justice Scalia and hoping that that memory lives forward to carry out his unmatched love for the law, love for his country, and love for his family and his religion. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman from New York for his kind words and for bringing a New York flavor here to such a wonderful man. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker). Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for taking the initiative to honor such a great man. In 1986, Antonin Scalia was nominated. I was a junior in high school. I am not sure it really resonated to me at the time what the next 30 years would entail. I believe it is safe to say that not only is he one of the strongest conservative voices of our day, but he could be of all time. I think of his life and I think of the example that he left for all of us, whether in politics or not. It is one thing to be conservative; it is another thing to effective. He showed with his life that he did not have to compromise his principles or his values to be effective. When I look at his peers around him, Justice Ginsburg many times talked about the friendship and the relationship she had with him. It was genuine. He took Justice Kagan hunting. He taught her how to hunt. She killed her first big deer with Justice Scalia at her side. What does that tell me? It tells me something that we need to remember: you can connect with people, you can hold your values, but you can have a genuine love for your fellow man. There is much to be said about Antonin Scalia's faith. Obviously, he lived it, but he lived it in a way that set an example for all of us. Yes, we get frustrated. It is okay to be angry--sometimes vertically, but never horizontally--with our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors, and our family. He set the mark. He set it high. He was someone that could work in, arguably, the toughest environment in the world, yet still gain the respect of his political archrivals. For that, I thank him. Tonight, I honor him for showing us how to be both conservative and effective. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam). Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Comstock for organizing this tonight. I just have a quick personal story, Mr. Speaker. Justice Scalia's daughter, Ann, lives in my neighborhood. I served in the State legislature, and I learned that this woman whose last name, obviously, was no longer Scalia, was the [[Page H842]] daughter of Justice Scalia. So I called her up, and I said: If your dad is ever in town, I would love to meet him. I was that guy, Mr. Speaker, who made that call, and she was very gracious. Sometime later, she called me up and said: Peter, my dad is coming in. Why don't you and your family stop by. So the Roskams ran around the corner. My wife, Elizabeth, myself, and my four children, who were young at the time, went over and spent a few minutes on a Sunday afternoon with Justice Scalia. He was very magnanimous and very gracious in his blue jeans and sweatshirt, getting up off the couch, but extending himself to us. A couple of years later, I won a seat in the U.S. House. I thought: Well, I have got a little bit of a connection. I will reach out and call him and try to make a courtesy call. I made some contact with his chambers and his staff and they said: Well, would you like to come over and listen to an argument? As a new Member of Congress, I said: I would love to go over. So, over I go and listen to an argument in the Supreme Court. It is very dramatic, as you know. I was walking out feeling a little bit let down because I actually wanted to say hello to Justice Scalia. But not to be disappointed, his staff said: Come on with us. So I went up to his office, and there in his chambers he set out a lunch. The two of us had lunch together. Now, who I was having lunch with was not lost on me. The magnitude, the scale, the capacity of this man and his ability to influence things on a grand scale was not lost on me. Yet he was really willing to spend some time with me that day. I have got to tell you one other quick story. A few years ago, I invited him to dinner. I said: Justice Scalia, I have got a number of my colleagues that would love to have dinner with you. Would you be willing to come out? Of course, he did. I told my wife afterward: This guy is so interesting and so charming, if he had a radio show, you would listen to it. You would set your timer so that you could listen to him. He was so interesting, so cleaver, and so quick and willing to take all kinds of questions and all kinds of debate and so forth. I just want to close by saying this. There are many, many times when we feel overwhelmed by events that are before us in our public life. There are many times when our constituents feel overwhelmed and they get this sense of: Is there anybody out there that has got some level of judgment and wisdom and capacity here? Are there any examples and role models? The answer is: Justice Scalia. He is an example. He is an example that we are all the beneficiaries of: his clear mind; his capacity to disagree without being disagreeable; his capacity to build people up; his capacity to articulate a world view; his capacity to be a faithful and vocal follower of his savior, Jesus, and not be defensive about it; and to basically invite people along to celebrate and to participate in this great gift, which is our democracy. Even in these short interactions that I had with him, you always got the sense--or, I did--that he got the joke. In other words, there was a twinkle in his eye. This is a democracy and we have got roles to play. His role on the Court was to do his thing. Our role, Mr. Speaker, is to legislate with that same sense of commitment and character and tenacity and clarity that Justice Scalia brought to his role on the judiciary. So, I want to honor Justice Scalia. I want to honor his wife, Mrs. Scalia. I want to honor his children and grandchildren. I thank them, because it is a sacrifice for them to have someone of that caliber and that capacity in that role for our country. It is not a burden that is easy, but they have been willing to bear that burden. Our country is better off for it. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for those lovely memories. In the outpouring that we saw in his passing, one of the pictures that I saw from a neighbor was a picture of Justice Scalia, who was probably coming home for a long day at work, and some children on our street had a lemonade stand. He had stopped and gotten out there to support those little entrepreneurs. The mom came out and took a picture of them. He was there beaming with those kids, in his suit, all dressed up, and these little kids are there with their lemonade stand and so proud. He really did take the time that my friend, Mr. Roskam, spoke about and really just engaged and loved life so much. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis). Mr. DeSANTIS. I thank my colleague from Virginia for organizing this fitting tribute to somebody who really, really did make a difference. Very few people who serve not only in the judiciary, but really at any level of government, leave the lasting mark that Antonin Scalia did. He will join the likes of John Marshall, Joseph Story, and Robert Jackson as one of the all-time greats in American law. I think of all the great things you can say about him. He was sharp, he was witty, and he wrote brilliantly. I think the reason why he is a titan of modern American law is because he insisted on discharging the judicial duty in a way that strengthened our overall constitutional order. He insisted on textualism when you are interpreting statutes. He had an originalist outlook when you are talking about the constitutional interpretation. Those frames of reference really vindicated the separation of powers. The judicial power under Article III is to decide cases and controversy. So you have cases before you that you have got to decide. It is not to go out and be a roving superlegislature. It is not to impose your philosophy on society. You decide cases. So, once judges free their decisionmaking from the objective meaning of the law in the Constitution, they are taking away power belonging to the American people that should be exercised through their Representatives. Justice Scalia always understood that. He was always insistent that judges have an objective standard when they are discharging their duty. When you talk about textualism, you read the statute for what it says. You don't correct the statute. You don't amend the statute. You don't find subjective views of some random legislature who happened to say something in a committee hearing. You actually apply the words as written. That is the judicial task. When you do that, you are basically vindicating the power of the Congress and of the people's elected Representatives, because they are the ones that wrote the law. If the courts depart from that, then they are departing from what the elected Representatives did. I am sure he saw countless statutes that were asinine as a matter of policy, but he said: That is not my job to correct that. So he is absolutely vindicating the separation of powers in the constitutional order. The same thing with constitutional interpretation. Before Justice Scalia took the bench, this was a freewheeling thing. Judges would say: Society matures and it is up to us to, effectively, update the meaning of the Constitution. That means you have five lawyers--unelected, unaccountable--that serve as an effective roving constitutional convention that can change the Constitution based on one case that happens to come in front of them. That was something that Justice Scalia thought was totally outside the bounds of the proper judicial role. He says the Constitution has a fixed, enduring meaning, and it is our job as judges to ascertain that meaning and apply it to the cases and controversies before us. So, if you look at a figure that has had more impact on how we think about the law and the Constitution over the last 50 years, you are not going to find one that surpasses Justice Antonin Scalia. He was a great American in every respect. He fought the good fight. He finished the race. He kept the faith. What a good guy. What a life. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus). Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from Virginia, for organizing this Special Order on behalf of this remarkable, remarkable American. On February 13 of this year, our country lost a giant. His legacy will [[Page H843]] never fade. Justice Scalia influenced countless jurists, attorneys, law students, and everyday Americans. My thoughts and prayers have been with his wife, Maureen, Father Paul, and the entire Scalia family since the passing of this outstanding American statesman. Regardless of whether one agreed with his opinions on the Supreme Court, this man's consistent integrity and admirable character cannot be denied. In both word and action, he was a man of the strongest character and deepest virtue. {time} 2000 This was evident in the commencement address he gave to the graduating class of the College of William and Mary in 1996, when he said: ``Bear in mind that brains and learning, like muscle and physical skill, are articles of commerce. They are bought and sold. You can hire them by the year or by the hour. The only thing in the world that is not for sale is character.'' The way he lived out the virtues of integrity and humility did not go unnoticed. Several weeks ago, we here in Washington had the opportunity to go to the National Prayer Breakfast, which attracted Members of Congress, the President, Senators, Ambassadors, people from all over the world, and we were treated with an appearance by famed tenor Andrea Bocelli. I think that Justice Scalia would have enjoyed his appearance and his appreciation for opera. In addition to his wonderful renditions of ``Panis Angelicus,'' which, again would have been another treat for Justice Scalia, and ``Amazing Grace,'' Mr. Bocelli lamented the dark shadow that war casts on the world and expressed concern for its victims, identifying war as a major problem in our world today. But then it was interesting. Mr. Bocelli stated: ``There is that small, hateful word, `hubris,' already known in antiquity.'' The ancient Greeks used it to define pride and the arrogance it entails. Bocelli's use of the word ``hubris'' was compelling in that he spoke it in the center of power here in the United States. That word conjures a theme that we have seen in Justice Scalia's work. Justice Scalia went about his task of considering significant constitutional and legal issues of the day with a profound and seldom seen humility about the role of courts in our country. They are not there to impose their own beliefs on the people, but to adjudicate competing claims in the context of a Constitution that has enduring meaning. To interpret the law in any other way otherwise aggrandizes power to a select few, a power that was never intended by the Founders. This humility of position that Justice Scalia had I believe will be a lasting legacy. Regardless of whether one agrees with Justice Scalia from a policy perspective, his writings reflect a profound respect for an understanding of our system of government and an unparalleled respect for an interpretation of the Constitution grounded in text and in history. For this our Nation should be forever grateful. May he rest in peace. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman, and I thank all of my colleagues for their comments. Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate this opportunity for all of our colleagues to join us in celebrating the life of this great man, Justice Scalia, who so many of us were privileged to know and count as a friend. For anyone who would like to view the beautiful mass of Christian burial for Justice Scalia that was presided over by his son, Father Paul Scalia, who gave a beautiful homily, that can be found on C-SPAN. I appreciate that that was covered. I also, again, appreciate this opportunity to celebrate this beautiful life, this family. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H839-H843] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poliquin). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this Special Order is meant to honor the life and three decades of service of Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia was a person of great joy, great intellect, great wit, and great faith. Our Nation suffered a tremendous loss on February 13 with the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. My husband Chip and I, my parents, and our children are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend, our neighbor, and, of course, a legal legend. He was a courageous advocate for the rule of law and the Constitution. Justice Scalia and his wife, Maureen, raised an incredible family of 9 children and 36 grandchildren, and we have been so privileged to know and love them. Justice Scalia was both a larger-than-life Justice, who leaves a profound legacy in the law, as well as a down-to-earth husband, father, grandfather, and absolutely delightful friend who loved his Lord and God, his wife and family, the law, the opera, his country, hunting, and a good laugh. We have all heard the stories of his friendship across the ideological spectrum, none more famous than his friendship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Scalia explained: ``If you can't disagree ardently with your colleagues about some issues of law and yet personally still be friends, get another job, for Pete's sake.'' Justice Ginsburg explained: ``As annoyed as you might be about his zinging dissent, he's so utterly charming, so amusing, so sometimes outrageous, you can't help but say `I'm glad that he's my friend or he's my colleague.' '' Justice Scalia was a shining example of fidelity, as he was ever- faithful to his oath to the law, to his family, and to his God. He was celebrated by so many in the legal community. He was a revered mentor to the dozens and dozens of clerks who lined the steps of the Supreme Court last Friday in his honor. And every one of them, no doubt, had a story that had profound legal discussions in it but also ended with a good laugh. He simply will be irreplaceable and leaves a legacy that will be consequential, discussed, and debated for the ages. On the personal front, his life was also a great and consequential life. Justice Scalia married his wife of over 55 years, Maureen, in 1960. They were set up on a blind date. He told one author that Maureen was ``the product of the best decision I ever made.'' His nine children--nine, how appropriate for a Supreme Court Justice--were split five and four, five boys, four girls. They became lawyers, a priest, a poet, an Army major, and parents themselves of those wonderful 36 grandchildren. Justice Scalia proudly gave the lion's share of the credit for raising this large brood to the resourceful, talented, and very smart love of his life, Maureen, who, as her son Paul said in the homily, matched him at every step. Justice Scalia said about his children ``and there's not a dullard in the bunch.'' His son, Father Paul Scalia, was the celebrant for his father's beautiful funeral mass with the assistance of dozens of priests at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception this past Saturday. Father Paul began his moving homily saying: ``We are gathered here because of one man, a man known personally to many of us, known only by reputation to many more; a man loved by many, scorned by others; a man known for great controversy and for great compassion. That man, of course, is Jesus of Nazareth.'' [[Page H840]] {time} 1930 Father Paul continued: ``In the past week, many have recounted what Dad did for them. But here today we reflect what God did for Dad, how He blessed him.'' Father Paul explained how his father understood that the deeper he went into his Catholic faith, the better a citizen and public servant he became. That faith now inspires his children and grandchildren and generations to come of the Scalia family and the so many lives he touched and influenced. Justice Scalia also had a rich tenor voice that intimidated many who came before the Court in front of him, but as his son Christopher explained, it was also perfect for reading stories to his grandchildren. His rendition of ``The Night Before Christmas'' was an annual tradition. He also led many sing-alongs at parties, played the piano, and also that singing would go on and on for their long car rides. Pictures with his children and grandchildren cover the walls and the end tables and the piano of the Scalia home, and in any picture with one or more of those children or grandchildren or with his beloved Maureen, Justice Scalia would always be beaming whenever he was around his family. An only child himself, he loved that he gave his children the gift of many brothers and sisters. No doubt that is a great solace to all of them now, as well as a source of great strength and support for their mother. May God bless Justice Antonin Scalia, a good and faithful son, and may God bless his wife, Maureen, and their entire family, and the scores and scores of their friends and his colleagues and the millions more of admirers, and may God bless the country that he so loved. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I especially thank Congresswoman Comstock for leading this tribute to Justice Scalia. The Nation's legal lights faded recently with the loss of the great Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but they will not be dimmed for long, for Justice Scalia left a legacy of illumination that will continue far beyond his mortal years. Although Justice Scalia is no longer with us on Earth, his cogent, witty, and plain-spoken writings will continue to educate law students and good citizens everywhere for centuries to come. Justice Scalia was no mere legal technician. He was a deep thinker who had an uncommon knack for crystallizing powerful ideas into trenchant, lasting prose. The journey on which he led his readers was always a joy, always compelling, because Justice Scalia always made clear where the path started. He once said: ``More important than your obligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your conscience correctly.'' And for Justice Scalia, as with morality, so it was with the law. Justice Scalia always made sure he built his argument on a solid foundation: the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. As a strong defender of the rule of law, he was a gentle legal giant. Like all great educators, Justice Scalia was respectful of others, regardless of their differing views. ``I attack ideas,'' he once said. ``I don't attack people. And some very good people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate the two, you gotta get another day job.'' That is a life lesson for all of us who engage in any debates and the ideas that undergird them. In that spirit, Justice Scalia often said: ``My best buddy on the Court is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has always been,'' and Justice Ginsburg's moving tribute to her own best buddy should reduce every bitter partisan to tears. Throughout his life, Justice Scalia correctly inveighed against the notion of a living Constitution, the misguided idea that the Constitution's text and original meaning somehow shifted this way and that with changes in popular attitudes. Justice Scalia said: That's the argument of constitutional flexibility and it goes something like this: The Constitution is over 200 years old, and societies change. It has to change with society, like a living organism, or it will become brittle and break. But . . . the Constitution is not a living organism; it is a legal document. It says some things and doesn't say other things. As a lifetime-appointed Supreme Court Justice, Justice Scalia, like all other lifetime-appointed judges, had the opportunity to effectively alter the meaning of the Constitution if he wanted and could garner the support of four of his colleagues. But like George Washington refusing the crown offered him, Justice Scalia rejected the notion the Supreme Court should impose its own preferred policies on the country through strained constitutional interpretations. Instead, Justice Scalia was an ardent defender of democracy, representative democracy. As he said: ``If you think aficionados of a living Constitution want to bring you flexibility, think again. You think the death penalty is a good idea? Persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it. You want a right to abortion? Persuade your fellow citizens and enact it. That's flexibility.'' Justice Scalia's respect for article I of the Constitution, the article that begins with these words, ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives,'' that article, which clearly sets forth the powers of the Congress to legislate, not the executive branch and not the courts, is one of Justice Scalia's greatest legacies. As much as Justice Scalia will be remembered as an able critic of the notion of a living Constitution, he will be remembered for his own living dissents, and many majority opinions, which will live forever in the hearts and minds of lovers of the law in America and around the world. Thank you, Justice Scalia. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I yield to my friend, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from Virginia, Barbara Comstock, for organizing this Special Order and for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, Father Paul Scalia said in his beautiful eulogy of his father, Justice Antonin Scalia, on Saturday: ``We give thanks that Jesus brought him to new life in baptism, nourished him with the Eucharist, and healed him in the confessional. God blessed Dad with a deep Catholic faith, the conviction that Christ's presence and power continue in the world today through His body, the Church.'' Mr. Speaker, last week our country lost one of its most outspoken and dedicated defenders of faith and liberty. For nearly 30 years, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stood as a monument to a faith-based viewpoint on the Constitution that will be sorely missed. There is no one in the history of our country who better protected the original intent of our Constitution and upheld the God-given rights of all Americans than Justice Scalia. Shown by his fierce dedication to defending our Constitution, from protecting Americans from government intrusion to protecting the rights of the unborn, Justice Scalia was a man of conviction, a man of passion, and a man of integrity. His honor and vigilance toward the original meaning of the Constitution and his historic dissents will ring throughout history. Every single ounce of Justice Scalia's heart and soul was devoted to our country, his faith, and his family. His wit, his candor, and his character will be missed on our Nation's highest Court. The legacy of Justice Scalia must never be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, I stand committed today to ensure we continue to prioritize faith and freedom in this country, protecting our natural- born rights as citizens of the United States of America. It is simply the right thing to do. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry). Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. When I was informed of the Justice's death, it came across my electronic devices. I texted my wife back home, and I said: I just want to cry. I had the extraordinary privilege of getting to know the Justice on a more personal basis. In western Nebraska there is a large outcropping. It is called [[Page H841]] Chimney Rock. Chimney Rock was the place that marks the halfway point across America. When the settlers crossed the great country, when they got to Chimney Rock, they knew that they were halfway along their journey. In the shadow of that rock, just this last December, I was in a duck blind with Justice Scalia who, as we all know, had that as an avocation. When you spend a couple of days in a duck blind with somebody, it is a bonding experience. You get to know them more personally. In my own reflections about what Chimney Rock meant to the country, a bridge between the past and the future, I thought it appropriately captured the character, the nature, the wisdom of the great Justice. He was a great student of American history, our legal system, a great protector of the Constitution and precedents. He understood how important it was to act in a consistent manner with principle while looking forward and applying that principle in ever-changing circumstances of American life. Because he did so with continuity and with consistency, he was a man of great integrity. His inner voice matched his outer voice. When we saw this beautiful outpouring of support at his funeral from people all across the political aisle, I think the common narrative there was a deep respect for this great man. Mr. Speaker, when he died, I felt like America lost her grandfather. He was a soaring intellect, had an incisive wit, and had in a certain sense a humble personality. He loved to share a joke. For me to have the privilege of spending some time in a personal intimate setting with him I count as an extraordinary privilege of my time in public service. May God rest his soul. May God grant him peace. May God continue to bless the United States of America and give us all the strength to continue to think through how we are going to elevate and form the next generation of Americans who can apply themselves in such an extraordinary, sacrificial way as Justice Scalia did. I remember one other comment I wanted to leave with you. I remember when the Justice asked me: How many children do you have? You beautifully talked about how he was so devoted to his family and faith. He asked me, knowing that I knew he had nine, he asked me how many children. I said: I have five. He paused. He said: Respectable. That was it. I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for her beautiful remarks and for giving me this moment to honor this great American. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his lovely remarks. Five is a good start, right, getting to that nine. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King). Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I especially thank her for arranging this Special Order tonight in memory of Justice Scalia, who was truly a legal giant. He was a man who surpassed all of the intellects that I have been aware of in my lifetime. Certainly no one in the legal profession has demonstrated more of a love for the law, more respect for the law, and more respect for the original intent of the Constitution. Now, I have nowhere near the personal contact with Justice Scalia that the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) did or the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry). I did meet him on a number of occasions. I had the opportunity to speak with him. Usually our conversations consisted of talking about the fact that we lived in working class neighborhoods in Queens. We grew up about a mile apart from each other. We both attended Jesuit high schools. That is about where the comparison ended as far as the Jesuit high schools, because he was valedictorian and I was far from it. He was a person who had the strength of somebody from the neighborhood, but he had the scholar's intellect. {time} 1945 He had an intellect that went beyond tremendous intelligence. It was an intellect that was shaped and framed by his deep religious faith and a belief in undiminished, lasting, and immutable principles. That is what reflected throughout his opinions. Yet he never let his own feelings or prejudices influence his thinking. That was certainly proven in the flag burning case. If there is anyone who loved his country and would oppose the concept of the act of flag burning, it was Justice Scalia. Yet he upheld the act as an expression of free speech, as much as it pained him. Something that many of us in politics and government have a hard time doing is following the letter of the law, following the intent of the law, and following the meaning of the law. Somehow, we like to put in our own feelings and beliefs. The fact is Justice Scalia told us that there is a higher principle than that. Also he had such a respect for language. There were no easy words thrown about. There were no escape clauses or phrases. There was an intent and purpose and meaning to everything that he did. To read his opinions, whether in the majority--and knowing that he was in the majority made us feel much better--or in his dissents, you realized, again, how determined he was, how forceful he was, and how committed he was to arriving at the correct decision--one which, again, followed the original intent of the Constitution. There were several references by Barbara Comstock to his funeral service on Saturday. Again, it was an expression by so many people of their love and respect for such an outstanding human being, a person whom I doubt we will ever see the likes of again--certainly, in our lifetimes. He was a giant of the law. He was a giant of his faith. He was a giant of his country. I am proud to join with all of my colleagues tonight--especially Barbara Comstock, who arranged this Special Order-- in honoring the memory of Justice Scalia and hoping that that memory lives forward to carry out his unmatched love for the law, love for his country, and love for his family and his religion. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman from New York for his kind words and for bringing a New York flavor here to such a wonderful man. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker). Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for taking the initiative to honor such a great man. In 1986, Antonin Scalia was nominated. I was a junior in high school. I am not sure it really resonated to me at the time what the next 30 years would entail. I believe it is safe to say that not only is he one of the strongest conservative voices of our day, but he could be of all time. I think of his life and I think of the example that he left for all of us, whether in politics or not. It is one thing to be conservative; it is another thing to effective. He showed with his life that he did not have to compromise his principles or his values to be effective. When I look at his peers around him, Justice Ginsburg many times talked about the friendship and the relationship she had with him. It was genuine. He took Justice Kagan hunting. He taught her how to hunt. She killed her first big deer with Justice Scalia at her side. What does that tell me? It tells me something that we need to remember: you can connect with people, you can hold your values, but you can have a genuine love for your fellow man. There is much to be said about Antonin Scalia's faith. Obviously, he lived it, but he lived it in a way that set an example for all of us. Yes, we get frustrated. It is okay to be angry--sometimes vertically, but never horizontally--with our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors, and our family. He set the mark. He set it high. He was someone that could work in, arguably, the toughest environment in the world, yet still gain the respect of his political archrivals. For that, I thank him. Tonight, I honor him for showing us how to be both conservative and effective. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam). Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Comstock for organizing this tonight. I just have a quick personal story, Mr. Speaker. Justice Scalia's daughter, Ann, lives in my neighborhood. I served in the State legislature, and I learned that this woman whose last name, obviously, was no longer Scalia, was the [[Page H842]] daughter of Justice Scalia. So I called her up, and I said: If your dad is ever in town, I would love to meet him. I was that guy, Mr. Speaker, who made that call, and she was very gracious. Sometime later, she called me up and said: Peter, my dad is coming in. Why don't you and your family stop by. So the Roskams ran around the corner. My wife, Elizabeth, myself, and my four children, who were young at the time, went over and spent a few minutes on a Sunday afternoon with Justice Scalia. He was very magnanimous and very gracious in his blue jeans and sweatshirt, getting up off the couch, but extending himself to us. A couple of years later, I won a seat in the U.S. House. I thought: Well, I have got a little bit of a connection. I will reach out and call him and try to make a courtesy call. I made some contact with his chambers and his staff and they said: Well, would you like to come over and listen to an argument? As a new Member of Congress, I said: I would love to go over. So, over I go and listen to an argument in the Supreme Court. It is very dramatic, as you know. I was walking out feeling a little bit let down because I actually wanted to say hello to Justice Scalia. But not to be disappointed, his staff said: Come on with us. So I went up to his office, and there in his chambers he set out a lunch. The two of us had lunch together. Now, who I was having lunch with was not lost on me. The magnitude, the scale, the capacity of this man and his ability to influence things on a grand scale was not lost on me. Yet he was really willing to spend some time with me that day. I have got to tell you one other quick story. A few years ago, I invited him to dinner. I said: Justice Scalia, I have got a number of my colleagues that would love to have dinner with you. Would you be willing to come out? Of course, he did. I told my wife afterward: This guy is so interesting and so charming, if he had a radio show, you would listen to it. You would set your timer so that you could listen to him. He was so interesting, so cleaver, and so quick and willing to take all kinds of questions and all kinds of debate and so forth. I just want to close by saying this. There are many, many times when we feel overwhelmed by events that are before us in our public life. There are many times when our constituents feel overwhelmed and they get this sense of: Is there anybody out there that has got some level of judgment and wisdom and capacity here? Are there any examples and role models? The answer is: Justice Scalia. He is an example. He is an example that we are all the beneficiaries of: his clear mind; his capacity to disagree without being disagreeable; his capacity to build people up; his capacity to articulate a world view; his capacity to be a faithful and vocal follower of his savior, Jesus, and not be defensive about it; and to basically invite people along to celebrate and to participate in this great gift, which is our democracy. Even in these short interactions that I had with him, you always got the sense--or, I did--that he got the joke. In other words, there was a twinkle in his eye. This is a democracy and we have got roles to play. His role on the Court was to do his thing. Our role, Mr. Speaker, is to legislate with that same sense of commitment and character and tenacity and clarity that Justice Scalia brought to his role on the judiciary. So, I want to honor Justice Scalia. I want to honor his wife, Mrs. Scalia. I want to honor his children and grandchildren. I thank them, because it is a sacrifice for them to have someone of that caliber and that capacity in that role for our country. It is not a burden that is easy, but they have been willing to bear that burden. Our country is better off for it. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for those lovely memories. In the outpouring that we saw in his passing, one of the pictures that I saw from a neighbor was a picture of Justice Scalia, who was probably coming home for a long day at work, and some children on our street had a lemonade stand. He had stopped and gotten out there to support those little entrepreneurs. The mom came out and took a picture of them. He was there beaming with those kids, in his suit, all dressed up, and these little kids are there with their lemonade stand and so proud. He really did take the time that my friend, Mr. Roskam, spoke about and really just engaged and loved life so much. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis). Mr. DeSANTIS. I thank my colleague from Virginia for organizing this fitting tribute to somebody who really, really did make a difference. Very few people who serve not only in the judiciary, but really at any level of government, leave the lasting mark that Antonin Scalia did. He will join the likes of John Marshall, Joseph Story, and Robert Jackson as one of the all-time greats in American law. I think of all the great things you can say about him. He was sharp, he was witty, and he wrote brilliantly. I think the reason why he is a titan of modern American law is because he insisted on discharging the judicial duty in a way that strengthened our overall constitutional order. He insisted on textualism when you are interpreting statutes. He had an originalist outlook when you are talking about the constitutional interpretation. Those frames of reference really vindicated the separation of powers. The judicial power under Article III is to decide cases and controversy. So you have cases before you that you have got to decide. It is not to go out and be a roving superlegislature. It is not to impose your philosophy on society. You decide cases. So, once judges free their decisionmaking from the objective meaning of the law in the Constitution, they are taking away power belonging to the American people that should be exercised through their Representatives. Justice Scalia always understood that. He was always insistent that judges have an objective standard when they are discharging their duty. When you talk about textualism, you read the statute for what it says. You don't correct the statute. You don't amend the statute. You don't find subjective views of some random legislature who happened to say something in a committee hearing. You actually apply the words as written. That is the judicial task. When you do that, you are basically vindicating the power of the Congress and of the people's elected Representatives, because they are the ones that wrote the law. If the courts depart from that, then they are departing from what the elected Representatives did. I am sure he saw countless statutes that were asinine as a matter of policy, but he said: That is not my job to correct that. So he is absolutely vindicating the separation of powers in the constitutional order. The same thing with constitutional interpretation. Before Justice Scalia took the bench, this was a freewheeling thing. Judges would say: Society matures and it is up to us to, effectively, update the meaning of the Constitution. That means you have five lawyers--unelected, unaccountable--that serve as an effective roving constitutional convention that can change the Constitution based on one case that happens to come in front of them. That was something that Justice Scalia thought was totally outside the bounds of the proper judicial role. He says the Constitution has a fixed, enduring meaning, and it is our job as judges to ascertain that meaning and apply it to the cases and controversies before us. So, if you look at a figure that has had more impact on how we think about the law and the Constitution over the last 50 years, you are not going to find one that surpasses Justice Antonin Scalia. He was a great American in every respect. He fought the good fight. He finished the race. He kept the faith. What a good guy. What a life. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus). Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from Virginia, for organizing this Special Order on behalf of this remarkable, remarkable American. On February 13 of this year, our country lost a giant. His legacy will [[Page H843]] never fade. Justice Scalia influenced countless jurists, attorneys, law students, and everyday Americans. My thoughts and prayers have been with his wife, Maureen, Father Paul, and the entire Scalia family since the passing of this outstanding American statesman. Regardless of whether one agreed with his opinions on the Supreme Court, this man's consistent integrity and admirable character cannot be denied. In both word and action, he was a man of the strongest character and deepest virtue. {time} 2000 This was evident in the commencement address he gave to the graduating class of the College of William and Mary in 1996, when he said: ``Bear in mind that brains and learning, like muscle and physical skill, are articles of commerce. They are bought and sold. You can hire them by the year or by the hour. The only thing in the world that is not for sale is character.'' The way he lived out the virtues of integrity and humility did not go unnoticed. Several weeks ago, we here in Washington had the opportunity to go to the National Prayer Breakfast, which attracted Members of Congress, the President, Senators, Ambassadors, people from all over the world, and we were treated with an appearance by famed tenor Andrea Bocelli. I think that Justice Scalia would have enjoyed his appearance and his appreciation for opera. In addition to his wonderful renditions of ``Panis Angelicus,'' which, again would have been another treat for Justice Scalia, and ``Amazing Grace,'' Mr. Bocelli lamented the dark shadow that war casts on the world and expressed concern for its victims, identifying war as a major problem in our world today. But then it was interesting. Mr. Bocelli stated: ``There is that small, hateful word, `hubris,' already known in antiquity.'' The ancient Greeks used it to define pride and the arrogance it entails. Bocelli's use of the word ``hubris'' was compelling in that he spoke it in the center of power here in the United States. That word conjures a theme that we have seen in Justice Scalia's work. Justice Scalia went about his task of considering significant constitutional and legal issues of the day with a profound and seldom seen humility about the role of courts in our country. They are not there to impose their own beliefs on the people, but to adjudicate competing claims in the context of a Constitution that has enduring meaning. To interpret the law in any other way otherwise aggrandizes power to a select few, a power that was never intended by the Founders. This humility of position that Justice Scalia had I believe will be a lasting legacy. Regardless of whether one agrees with Justice Scalia from a policy perspective, his writings reflect a profound respect for an understanding of our system of government and an unparalleled respect for an interpretation of the Constitution grounded in text and in history. For this our Nation should be forever grateful. May he rest in peace. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman, and I thank all of my colleagues for their comments. Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate this opportunity for all of our colleagues to join us in celebrating the life of this great man, Justice Scalia, who so many of us were privileged to know and count as a friend. For anyone who would like to view the beautiful mass of Christian burial for Justice Scalia that was presided over by his son, Father Paul Scalia, who gave a beautiful homily, that can be found on C-SPAN. I appreciate that that was covered. I also, again, appreciate this opportunity to celebrate this beautiful life, this family. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H839-H843] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poliquin). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this Special Order is meant to honor the life and three decades of service of Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia was a person of great joy, great intellect, great wit, and great faith. Our Nation suffered a tremendous loss on February 13 with the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. My husband Chip and I, my parents, and our children are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend, our neighbor, and, of course, a legal legend. He was a courageous advocate for the rule of law and the Constitution. Justice Scalia and his wife, Maureen, raised an incredible family of 9 children and 36 grandchildren, and we have been so privileged to know and love them. Justice Scalia was both a larger-than-life Justice, who leaves a profound legacy in the law, as well as a down-to-earth husband, father, grandfather, and absolutely delightful friend who loved his Lord and God, his wife and family, the law, the opera, his country, hunting, and a good laugh. We have all heard the stories of his friendship across the ideological spectrum, none more famous than his friendship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Scalia explained: ``If you can't disagree ardently with your colleagues about some issues of law and yet personally still be friends, get another job, for Pete's sake.'' Justice Ginsburg explained: ``As annoyed as you might be about his zinging dissent, he's so utterly charming, so amusing, so sometimes outrageous, you can't help but say `I'm glad that he's my friend or he's my colleague.' '' Justice Scalia was a shining example of fidelity, as he was ever- faithful to his oath to the law, to his family, and to his God. He was celebrated by so many in the legal community. He was a revered mentor to the dozens and dozens of clerks who lined the steps of the Supreme Court last Friday in his honor. And every one of them, no doubt, had a story that had profound legal discussions in it but also ended with a good laugh. He simply will be irreplaceable and leaves a legacy that will be consequential, discussed, and debated for the ages. On the personal front, his life was also a great and consequential life. Justice Scalia married his wife of over 55 years, Maureen, in 1960. They were set up on a blind date. He told one author that Maureen was ``the product of the best decision I ever made.'' His nine children--nine, how appropriate for a Supreme Court Justice--were split five and four, five boys, four girls. They became lawyers, a priest, a poet, an Army major, and parents themselves of those wonderful 36 grandchildren. Justice Scalia proudly gave the lion's share of the credit for raising this large brood to the resourceful, talented, and very smart love of his life, Maureen, who, as her son Paul said in the homily, matched him at every step. Justice Scalia said about his children ``and there's not a dullard in the bunch.'' His son, Father Paul Scalia, was the celebrant for his father's beautiful funeral mass with the assistance of dozens of priests at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception this past Saturday. Father Paul began his moving homily saying: ``We are gathered here because of one man, a man known personally to many of us, known only by reputation to many more; a man loved by many, scorned by others; a man known for great controversy and for great compassion. That man, of course, is Jesus of Nazareth.'' [[Page H840]] {time} 1930 Father Paul continued: ``In the past week, many have recounted what Dad did for them. But here today we reflect what God did for Dad, how He blessed him.'' Father Paul explained how his father understood that the deeper he went into his Catholic faith, the better a citizen and public servant he became. That faith now inspires his children and grandchildren and generations to come of the Scalia family and the so many lives he touched and influenced. Justice Scalia also had a rich tenor voice that intimidated many who came before the Court in front of him, but as his son Christopher explained, it was also perfect for reading stories to his grandchildren. His rendition of ``The Night Before Christmas'' was an annual tradition. He also led many sing-alongs at parties, played the piano, and also that singing would go on and on for their long car rides. Pictures with his children and grandchildren cover the walls and the end tables and the piano of the Scalia home, and in any picture with one or more of those children or grandchildren or with his beloved Maureen, Justice Scalia would always be beaming whenever he was around his family. An only child himself, he loved that he gave his children the gift of many brothers and sisters. No doubt that is a great solace to all of them now, as well as a source of great strength and support for their mother. May God bless Justice Antonin Scalia, a good and faithful son, and may God bless his wife, Maureen, and their entire family, and the scores and scores of their friends and his colleagues and the millions more of admirers, and may God bless the country that he so loved. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I especially thank Congresswoman Comstock for leading this tribute to Justice Scalia. The Nation's legal lights faded recently with the loss of the great Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but they will not be dimmed for long, for Justice Scalia left a legacy of illumination that will continue far beyond his mortal years. Although Justice Scalia is no longer with us on Earth, his cogent, witty, and plain-spoken writings will continue to educate law students and good citizens everywhere for centuries to come. Justice Scalia was no mere legal technician. He was a deep thinker who had an uncommon knack for crystallizing powerful ideas into trenchant, lasting prose. The journey on which he led his readers was always a joy, always compelling, because Justice Scalia always made clear where the path started. He once said: ``More important than your obligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your conscience correctly.'' And for Justice Scalia, as with morality, so it was with the law. Justice Scalia always made sure he built his argument on a solid foundation: the Constitution, the supreme law of the land. As a strong defender of the rule of law, he was a gentle legal giant. Like all great educators, Justice Scalia was respectful of others, regardless of their differing views. ``I attack ideas,'' he once said. ``I don't attack people. And some very good people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate the two, you gotta get another day job.'' That is a life lesson for all of us who engage in any debates and the ideas that undergird them. In that spirit, Justice Scalia often said: ``My best buddy on the Court is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has always been,'' and Justice Ginsburg's moving tribute to her own best buddy should reduce every bitter partisan to tears. Throughout his life, Justice Scalia correctly inveighed against the notion of a living Constitution, the misguided idea that the Constitution's text and original meaning somehow shifted this way and that with changes in popular attitudes. Justice Scalia said: That's the argument of constitutional flexibility and it goes something like this: The Constitution is over 200 years old, and societies change. It has to change with society, like a living organism, or it will become brittle and break. But . . . the Constitution is not a living organism; it is a legal document. It says some things and doesn't say other things. As a lifetime-appointed Supreme Court Justice, Justice Scalia, like all other lifetime-appointed judges, had the opportunity to effectively alter the meaning of the Constitution if he wanted and could garner the support of four of his colleagues. But like George Washington refusing the crown offered him, Justice Scalia rejected the notion the Supreme Court should impose its own preferred policies on the country through strained constitutional interpretations. Instead, Justice Scalia was an ardent defender of democracy, representative democracy. As he said: ``If you think aficionados of a living Constitution want to bring you flexibility, think again. You think the death penalty is a good idea? Persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it. You want a right to abortion? Persuade your fellow citizens and enact it. That's flexibility.'' Justice Scalia's respect for article I of the Constitution, the article that begins with these words, ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives,'' that article, which clearly sets forth the powers of the Congress to legislate, not the executive branch and not the courts, is one of Justice Scalia's greatest legacies. As much as Justice Scalia will be remembered as an able critic of the notion of a living Constitution, he will be remembered for his own living dissents, and many majority opinions, which will live forever in the hearts and minds of lovers of the law in America and around the world. Thank you, Justice Scalia. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I yield to my friend, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from Virginia, Barbara Comstock, for organizing this Special Order and for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, Father Paul Scalia said in his beautiful eulogy of his father, Justice Antonin Scalia, on Saturday: ``We give thanks that Jesus brought him to new life in baptism, nourished him with the Eucharist, and healed him in the confessional. God blessed Dad with a deep Catholic faith, the conviction that Christ's presence and power continue in the world today through His body, the Church.'' Mr. Speaker, last week our country lost one of its most outspoken and dedicated defenders of faith and liberty. For nearly 30 years, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stood as a monument to a faith-based viewpoint on the Constitution that will be sorely missed. There is no one in the history of our country who better protected the original intent of our Constitution and upheld the God-given rights of all Americans than Justice Scalia. Shown by his fierce dedication to defending our Constitution, from protecting Americans from government intrusion to protecting the rights of the unborn, Justice Scalia was a man of conviction, a man of passion, and a man of integrity. His honor and vigilance toward the original meaning of the Constitution and his historic dissents will ring throughout history. Every single ounce of Justice Scalia's heart and soul was devoted to our country, his faith, and his family. His wit, his candor, and his character will be missed on our Nation's highest Court. The legacy of Justice Scalia must never be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, I stand committed today to ensure we continue to prioritize faith and freedom in this country, protecting our natural- born rights as citizens of the United States of America. It is simply the right thing to do. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry). Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. When I was informed of the Justice's death, it came across my electronic devices. I texted my wife back home, and I said: I just want to cry. I had the extraordinary privilege of getting to know the Justice on a more personal basis. In western Nebraska there is a large outcropping. It is called [[Page H841]] Chimney Rock. Chimney Rock was the place that marks the halfway point across America. When the settlers crossed the great country, when they got to Chimney Rock, they knew that they were halfway along their journey. In the shadow of that rock, just this last December, I was in a duck blind with Justice Scalia who, as we all know, had that as an avocation. When you spend a couple of days in a duck blind with somebody, it is a bonding experience. You get to know them more personally. In my own reflections about what Chimney Rock meant to the country, a bridge between the past and the future, I thought it appropriately captured the character, the nature, the wisdom of the great Justice. He was a great student of American history, our legal system, a great protector of the Constitution and precedents. He understood how important it was to act in a consistent manner with principle while looking forward and applying that principle in ever-changing circumstances of American life. Because he did so with continuity and with consistency, he was a man of great integrity. His inner voice matched his outer voice. When we saw this beautiful outpouring of support at his funeral from people all across the political aisle, I think the common narrative there was a deep respect for this great man. Mr. Speaker, when he died, I felt like America lost her grandfather. He was a soaring intellect, had an incisive wit, and had in a certain sense a humble personality. He loved to share a joke. For me to have the privilege of spending some time in a personal intimate setting with him I count as an extraordinary privilege of my time in public service. May God rest his soul. May God grant him peace. May God continue to bless the United States of America and give us all the strength to continue to think through how we are going to elevate and form the next generation of Americans who can apply themselves in such an extraordinary, sacrificial way as Justice Scalia did. I remember one other comment I wanted to leave with you. I remember when the Justice asked me: How many children do you have? You beautifully talked about how he was so devoted to his family and faith. He asked me, knowing that I knew he had nine, he asked me how many children. I said: I have five. He paused. He said: Respectable. That was it. I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for her beautiful remarks and for giving me this moment to honor this great American. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his lovely remarks. Five is a good start, right, getting to that nine. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King). Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I especially thank her for arranging this Special Order tonight in memory of Justice Scalia, who was truly a legal giant. He was a man who surpassed all of the intellects that I have been aware of in my lifetime. Certainly no one in the legal profession has demonstrated more of a love for the law, more respect for the law, and more respect for the original intent of the Constitution. Now, I have nowhere near the personal contact with Justice Scalia that the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) did or the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry). I did meet him on a number of occasions. I had the opportunity to speak with him. Usually our conversations consisted of talking about the fact that we lived in working class neighborhoods in Queens. We grew up about a mile apart from each other. We both attended Jesuit high schools. That is about where the comparison ended as far as the Jesuit high schools, because he was valedictorian and I was far from it. He was a person who had the strength of somebody from the neighborhood, but he had the scholar's intellect. {time} 1945 He had an intellect that went beyond tremendous intelligence. It was an intellect that was shaped and framed by his deep religious faith and a belief in undiminished, lasting, and immutable principles. That is what reflected throughout his opinions. Yet he never let his own feelings or prejudices influence his thinking. That was certainly proven in the flag burning case. If there is anyone who loved his country and would oppose the concept of the act of flag burning, it was Justice Scalia. Yet he upheld the act as an expression of free speech, as much as it pained him. Something that many of us in politics and government have a hard time doing is following the letter of the law, following the intent of the law, and following the meaning of the law. Somehow, we like to put in our own feelings and beliefs. The fact is Justice Scalia told us that there is a higher principle than that. Also he had such a respect for language. There were no easy words thrown about. There were no escape clauses or phrases. There was an intent and purpose and meaning to everything that he did. To read his opinions, whether in the majority--and knowing that he was in the majority made us feel much better--or in his dissents, you realized, again, how determined he was, how forceful he was, and how committed he was to arriving at the correct decision--one which, again, followed the original intent of the Constitution. There were several references by Barbara Comstock to his funeral service on Saturday. Again, it was an expression by so many people of their love and respect for such an outstanding human being, a person whom I doubt we will ever see the likes of again--certainly, in our lifetimes. He was a giant of the law. He was a giant of his faith. He was a giant of his country. I am proud to join with all of my colleagues tonight--especially Barbara Comstock, who arranged this Special Order-- in honoring the memory of Justice Scalia and hoping that that memory lives forward to carry out his unmatched love for the law, love for his country, and love for his family and his religion. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman from New York for his kind words and for bringing a New York flavor here to such a wonderful man. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker). Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for taking the initiative to honor such a great man. In 1986, Antonin Scalia was nominated. I was a junior in high school. I am not sure it really resonated to me at the time what the next 30 years would entail. I believe it is safe to say that not only is he one of the strongest conservative voices of our day, but he could be of all time. I think of his life and I think of the example that he left for all of us, whether in politics or not. It is one thing to be conservative; it is another thing to effective. He showed with his life that he did not have to compromise his principles or his values to be effective. When I look at his peers around him, Justice Ginsburg many times talked about the friendship and the relationship she had with him. It was genuine. He took Justice Kagan hunting. He taught her how to hunt. She killed her first big deer with Justice Scalia at her side. What does that tell me? It tells me something that we need to remember: you can connect with people, you can hold your values, but you can have a genuine love for your fellow man. There is much to be said about Antonin Scalia's faith. Obviously, he lived it, but he lived it in a way that set an example for all of us. Yes, we get frustrated. It is okay to be angry--sometimes vertically, but never horizontally--with our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors, and our family. He set the mark. He set it high. He was someone that could work in, arguably, the toughest environment in the world, yet still gain the respect of his political archrivals. For that, I thank him. Tonight, I honor him for showing us how to be both conservative and effective. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam). Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Comstock for organizing this tonight. I just have a quick personal story, Mr. Speaker. Justice Scalia's daughter, Ann, lives in my neighborhood. I served in the State legislature, and I learned that this woman whose last name, obviously, was no longer Scalia, was the [[Page H842]] daughter of Justice Scalia. So I called her up, and I said: If your dad is ever in town, I would love to meet him. I was that guy, Mr. Speaker, who made that call, and she was very gracious. Sometime later, she called me up and said: Peter, my dad is coming in. Why don't you and your family stop by. So the Roskams ran around the corner. My wife, Elizabeth, myself, and my four children, who were young at the time, went over and spent a few minutes on a Sunday afternoon with Justice Scalia. He was very magnanimous and very gracious in his blue jeans and sweatshirt, getting up off the couch, but extending himself to us. A couple of years later, I won a seat in the U.S. House. I thought: Well, I have got a little bit of a connection. I will reach out and call him and try to make a courtesy call. I made some contact with his chambers and his staff and they said: Well, would you like to come over and listen to an argument? As a new Member of Congress, I said: I would love to go over. So, over I go and listen to an argument in the Supreme Court. It is very dramatic, as you know. I was walking out feeling a little bit let down because I actually wanted to say hello to Justice Scalia. But not to be disappointed, his staff said: Come on with us. So I went up to his office, and there in his chambers he set out a lunch. The two of us had lunch together. Now, who I was having lunch with was not lost on me. The magnitude, the scale, the capacity of this man and his ability to influence things on a grand scale was not lost on me. Yet he was really willing to spend some time with me that day. I have got to tell you one other quick story. A few years ago, I invited him to dinner. I said: Justice Scalia, I have got a number of my colleagues that would love to have dinner with you. Would you be willing to come out? Of course, he did. I told my wife afterward: This guy is so interesting and so charming, if he had a radio show, you would listen to it. You would set your timer so that you could listen to him. He was so interesting, so cleaver, and so quick and willing to take all kinds of questions and all kinds of debate and so forth. I just want to close by saying this. There are many, many times when we feel overwhelmed by events that are before us in our public life. There are many times when our constituents feel overwhelmed and they get this sense of: Is there anybody out there that has got some level of judgment and wisdom and capacity here? Are there any examples and role models? The answer is: Justice Scalia. He is an example. He is an example that we are all the beneficiaries of: his clear mind; his capacity to disagree without being disagreeable; his capacity to build people up; his capacity to articulate a world view; his capacity to be a faithful and vocal follower of his savior, Jesus, and not be defensive about it; and to basically invite people along to celebrate and to participate in this great gift, which is our democracy. Even in these short interactions that I had with him, you always got the sense--or, I did--that he got the joke. In other words, there was a twinkle in his eye. This is a democracy and we have got roles to play. His role on the Court was to do his thing. Our role, Mr. Speaker, is to legislate with that same sense of commitment and character and tenacity and clarity that Justice Scalia brought to his role on the judiciary. So, I want to honor Justice Scalia. I want to honor his wife, Mrs. Scalia. I want to honor his children and grandchildren. I thank them, because it is a sacrifice for them to have someone of that caliber and that capacity in that role for our country. It is not a burden that is easy, but they have been willing to bear that burden. Our country is better off for it. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman for those lovely memories. In the outpouring that we saw in his passing, one of the pictures that I saw from a neighbor was a picture of Justice Scalia, who was probably coming home for a long day at work, and some children on our street had a lemonade stand. He had stopped and gotten out there to support those little entrepreneurs. The mom came out and took a picture of them. He was there beaming with those kids, in his suit, all dressed up, and these little kids are there with their lemonade stand and so proud. He really did take the time that my friend, Mr. Roskam, spoke about and really just engaged and loved life so much. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis). Mr. DeSANTIS. I thank my colleague from Virginia for organizing this fitting tribute to somebody who really, really did make a difference. Very few people who serve not only in the judiciary, but really at any level of government, leave the lasting mark that Antonin Scalia did. He will join the likes of John Marshall, Joseph Story, and Robert Jackson as one of the all-time greats in American law. I think of all the great things you can say about him. He was sharp, he was witty, and he wrote brilliantly. I think the reason why he is a titan of modern American law is because he insisted on discharging the judicial duty in a way that strengthened our overall constitutional order. He insisted on textualism when you are interpreting statutes. He had an originalist outlook when you are talking about the constitutional interpretation. Those frames of reference really vindicated the separation of powers. The judicial power under Article III is to decide cases and controversy. So you have cases before you that you have got to decide. It is not to go out and be a roving superlegislature. It is not to impose your philosophy on society. You decide cases. So, once judges free their decisionmaking from the objective meaning of the law in the Constitution, they are taking away power belonging to the American people that should be exercised through their Representatives. Justice Scalia always understood that. He was always insistent that judges have an objective standard when they are discharging their duty. When you talk about textualism, you read the statute for what it says. You don't correct the statute. You don't amend the statute. You don't find subjective views of some random legislature who happened to say something in a committee hearing. You actually apply the words as written. That is the judicial task. When you do that, you are basically vindicating the power of the Congress and of the people's elected Representatives, because they are the ones that wrote the law. If the courts depart from that, then they are departing from what the elected Representatives did. I am sure he saw countless statutes that were asinine as a matter of policy, but he said: That is not my job to correct that. So he is absolutely vindicating the separation of powers in the constitutional order. The same thing with constitutional interpretation. Before Justice Scalia took the bench, this was a freewheeling thing. Judges would say: Society matures and it is up to us to, effectively, update the meaning of the Constitution. That means you have five lawyers--unelected, unaccountable--that serve as an effective roving constitutional convention that can change the Constitution based on one case that happens to come in front of them. That was something that Justice Scalia thought was totally outside the bounds of the proper judicial role. He says the Constitution has a fixed, enduring meaning, and it is our job as judges to ascertain that meaning and apply it to the cases and controversies before us. So, if you look at a figure that has had more impact on how we think about the law and the Constitution over the last 50 years, you are not going to find one that surpasses Justice Antonin Scalia. He was a great American in every respect. He fought the good fight. He finished the race. He kept the faith. What a good guy. What a life. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus). Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from Virginia, for organizing this Special Order on behalf of this remarkable, remarkable American. On February 13 of this year, our country lost a giant. His legacy will [[Page H843]] never fade. Justice Scalia influenced countless jurists, attorneys, law students, and everyday Americans. My thoughts and prayers have been with his wife, Maureen, Father Paul, and the entire Scalia family since the passing of this outstanding American statesman. Regardless of whether one agreed with his opinions on the Supreme Court, this man's consistent integrity and admirable character cannot be denied. In both word and action, he was a man of the strongest character and deepest virtue. {time} 2000 This was evident in the commencement address he gave to the graduating class of the College of William and Mary in 1996, when he said: ``Bear in mind that brains and learning, like muscle and physical skill, are articles of commerce. They are bought and sold. You can hire them by the year or by the hour. The only thing in the world that is not for sale is character.'' The way he lived out the virtues of integrity and humility did not go unnoticed. Several weeks ago, we here in Washington had the opportunity to go to the National Prayer Breakfast, which attracted Members of Congress, the President, Senators, Ambassadors, people from all over the world, and we were treated with an appearance by famed tenor Andrea Bocelli. I think that Justice Scalia would have enjoyed his appearance and his appreciation for opera. In addition to his wonderful renditions of ``Panis Angelicus,'' which, again would have been another treat for Justice Scalia, and ``Amazing Grace,'' Mr. Bocelli lamented the dark shadow that war casts on the world and expressed concern for its victims, identifying war as a major problem in our world today. But then it was interesting. Mr. Bocelli stated: ``There is that small, hateful word, `hubris,' already known in antiquity.'' The ancient Greeks used it to define pride and the arrogance it entails. Bocelli's use of the word ``hubris'' was compelling in that he spoke it in the center of power here in the United States. That word conjures a theme that we have seen in Justice Scalia's work. Justice Scalia went about his task of considering significant constitutional and legal issues of the day with a profound and seldom seen humility about the role of courts in our country. They are not there to impose their own beliefs on the people, but to adjudicate competing claims in the context of a Constitution that has enduring meaning. To interpret the law in any other way otherwise aggrandizes power to a select few, a power that was never intended by the Founders. This humility of position that Justice Scalia had I believe will be a lasting legacy. Regardless of whether one agrees with Justice Scalia from a policy perspective, his writings reflect a profound respect for an understanding of our system of government and an unparalleled respect for an interpretation of the Constitution grounded in text and in history. For this our Nation should be forever grateful. May he rest in peace. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the gentleman, and I thank all of my colleagues for their comments. Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate this opportunity for all of our colleagues to join us in celebrating the life of this great man, Justice Scalia, who so many of us were privileged to know and count as a friend. For anyone who would like to view the beautiful mass of Christian burial for Justice Scalia that was presided over by his son, Father Paul Scalia, who gave a beautiful homily, that can be found on C-SPAN. I appreciate that that was covered. I also, again, appreciate this opportunity to celebrate this beautiful life, this family. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,32600,32600,32671,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [house] [pages h839-h843] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring the life and service of supreme court justice antonin scalia the speaker pro tempore (mr. poliquin). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from virginia (mrs. comstock) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. general leave mrs. comstock. mr. speaker, before i begin, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the subject of this special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from virginia? there was no objection. mrs. comstock. mr. speaker, this special order is meant to honor the life and three decades of service of associate justice of the united states supreme court antonin scalia. justice scalia was a person of great joy, great intellect, great wit, and great faith. our nation suffered a tremendous loss on february 13 with the passing of justice antonin scalia. my husband chip and i, my parents, and our children are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend, our neighbor, and, of course, a legal legend. he was a courageous advocate for the rule of law and the constitution. justice scalia and his wife, maureen, raised an incredible family of 9 children and 36 grandchildren, and we have been so privileged to know and love them. justice scalia was both a larger-than-life justice, who leaves a profound legacy in the law, as well as a down-to-earth husband, father, grandfather, and absolutely delightful friend who loved his lord and god, his wife and family, the law, the opera, his country, hunting, and a good laugh. we have all heard the stories of his friendship across the ideological spectrum, none more famous than his friendship with justice ruth bader ginsburg. justice scalia explained: ``if you can't disagree ardently with your colleagues about some issues of law and yet personally still be friends, get another job, for pete's sake.'' justice ginsburg explained: ``as annoyed as you might be about his zinging dissent, he's so utterly charming, so amusing, so sometimes outrageous, you can't help but say `i'm glad that he's my friend or he's my colleague.' '' justice scalia was a shining example of fidelity, as he was ever- faithful to his oath to the law, to his family, and to his god. he was celebrated by so many in the legal community. he was a revered mentor to the dozens and dozens of clerks who lined the steps of the supreme court last friday in his honor. and every one of them, no doubt, had a story that had profound legal discussions in it but also ended with a good laugh. he simply will be irreplaceable and leaves a legacy that will be consequential, discussed, and debated for the ages. on the personal front, his life was also a great and consequential life. justice scalia married his wife of over 55 years, maureen, in 1960. they were set up on a blind date. he told one author that maureen was ``the product of the best decision i ever made.'' his nine children--nine, how appropriate for a supreme court justice--were split five and four, five boys, four girls. they became lawyers, a priest, a poet, an army major, and parents themselves of those wonderful 36 grandchildren. justice scalia proudly gave the lion's share of the credit for raising this large brood to the resourceful, talented, and very smart love of his life, maureen, who, as her son paul said in the homily, matched him at every step. justice scalia said about his children ``and there's not a dullard in the bunch.'' his son, father paul scalia, was the celebrant for his father's beautiful funeral mass with the assistance of dozens of priests at the basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception this past saturday. father paul began his moving homily saying: ``we are gathered here because of one man, a man known personally to many of us, known only by reputation to many more; a man loved by many, scorned by others; a man known for great controversy and for great compassion. that man, of course, is jesus of nazareth.'' [[page h840]] {time} 1930 father paul continued: ``in the past week, many have recounted what dad did for them. but here today we reflect what god did for dad, how he blessed him.'' father paul explained how his father understood that the deeper he went into his catholic faith, the better a citizen and public servant he became. that faith now inspires his children and grandchildren and generations to come of the scalia family and the so many lives he touched and influenced. justice scalia also had a rich tenor voice that intimidated many who came before the court in front of him, but as his son christopher explained, it was also perfect for reading stories to his grandchildren. his rendition of ``the night before christmas'' was an annual tradition. he also led many sing-alongs at parties, played the piano, and also that singing would go on and on for their long car rides. pictures with his children and grandchildren cover the walls and the end tables and the piano of the scalia home, and in any picture with one or more of those children or grandchildren or with his beloved maureen, justice scalia would always be beaming whenever he was around his family. an only child himself, he loved that he gave his children the gift of many brothers and sisters. no doubt that is a great solace to all of them now, as well as a source of great strength and support for their mother. may god bless justice antonin scalia, a good and faithful son, and may god bless his wife, maureen, and their entire family, and the scores and scores of their friends and his colleagues and the millions more of admirers, and may god bless the country that he so loved. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from virginia (mr. goodlatte), the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i especially thank congresswoman comstock for leading this tribute to justice scalia. the nation's legal lights faded recently with the loss of the great supreme court justice antonin scalia, but they will not be dimmed for long, for justice scalia left a legacy of illumination that will continue far beyond his mortal years. although justice scalia is no longer with us on earth, his cogent, witty, and plain-spoken writings will continue to educate law students and good citizens everywhere for centuries to come. justice scalia was no mere legal technician. he was a deep thinker who had an uncommon knack for crystallizing powerful ideas into trenchant, lasting prose. the journey on which he led his readers was always a joy, always compelling, because justice scalia always made clear where the path started. he once said: ``more important than your obligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your conscience correctly.'' and for justice scalia, as with morality, so it was with the law. justice scalia always made sure he built his argument on a solid foundation: the constitution, the supreme law of the land. as a strong defender of the rule of law, he was a gentle legal giant. like all great educators, justice scalia was respectful of others, regardless of their differing views. ``i attack ideas,'' he once said. ``i don't attack people. and some very good people have some very bad ideas. and if you can't separate the two, you gotta get another day job.'' that is a life lesson for all of us who engage in any debates and the ideas that undergird them. in that spirit, justice scalia often said: ``my best buddy on the court is ruth bader ginsburg, has always been,'' and justice ginsburg's moving tribute to her own best buddy should reduce every bitter partisan to tears. throughout his life, justice scalia correctly inveighed against the notion of a living constitution, the misguided idea that the constitution's text and original meaning somehow shifted this way and that with changes in popular attitudes. justice scalia said: that's the argument of constitutional flexibility and it goes something like this: the constitution is over 200 years old, and societies change. it has to change with society, like a living organism, or it will become brittle and break. but . . . the constitution is not a living organism; it is a legal document. it says some things and doesn't say other things. as a lifetime-appointed supreme court justice, justice scalia, like all other lifetime-appointed judges, had the opportunity to effectively alter the meaning of the constitution if he wanted and could garner the support of four of his colleagues. but like george washington refusing the crown offered him, justice scalia rejected the notion the supreme court should impose its own preferred policies on the country through strained constitutional interpretations. instead, justice scalia was an ardent defender of democracy, representative democracy. as he said: ``if you think aficionados of a living constitution want to bring you flexibility, think again. you think the death penalty is a good idea? persuade your fellow citizens to adopt it. you want a right to abortion? persuade your fellow citizens and enact it. that's flexibility.'' justice scalia's respect for article i of the constitution, the article that begins with these words, ``all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states, which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives,'' that article, which clearly sets forth the powers of the congress to legislate, not the executive branch and not the courts, is one of justice scalia's greatest legacies. as much as justice scalia will be remembered as an able critic of the notion of a living constitution, he will be remembered for his own living dissents, and many majority opinions, which will live forever in the hearts and minds of lovers of the law in america and around the world. thank you, justice scalia. mrs. comstock. i thank the gentleman for his remarks. i yield to my friend, the gentlewoman from missouri (mrs. wagner). mrs. wagner. mr. speaker, i thank my dear friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from virginia, barbara comstock, for organizing this special order and for yielding to me. mr. speaker, father paul scalia said in his beautiful eulogy of his father, justice antonin scalia, on saturday: ``we give thanks that jesus brought him to new life in baptism, nourished him with the eucharist, and healed him in the confessional. god blessed dad with a deep catholic faith, the conviction that christ's presence and power continue in the world today through his body, the church.'' mr. speaker, last week our country lost one of its most outspoken and dedicated defenders of faith and liberty. for nearly 30 years, supreme court justice antonin scalia stood as a monument to a faith-based viewpoint on the constitution that will be sorely missed. there is no one in the history of our country who better protected the original intent of our constitution and upheld the god-given rights of all americans than justice scalia. shown by his fierce dedication to defending our constitution, from protecting americans from government intrusion to protecting the rights of the unborn, justice scalia was a man of conviction, a man of passion, and a man of integrity. his honor and vigilance toward the original meaning of the constitution and his historic dissents will ring throughout history. every single ounce of justice scalia's heart and soul was devoted to our country, his faith, and his family. his wit, his candor, and his character will be missed on our nation's highest court. the legacy of justice scalia must never be forgotten. mr. speaker, i stand committed today to ensure we continue to prioritize faith and freedom in this country, protecting our natural- born rights as citizens of the united states of america. it is simply the right thing to do. mrs. comstock. i thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. i yield to the gentleman from nebraska (mr. fortenberry). mr. fortenberry. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. when i was informed of the justice's death, it came across my electronic devices. i texted my wife back home, and i said: i just want to cry. i had the extraordinary privilege of getting to know the justice on a more personal basis. in western nebraska there is a large outcropping. it is called [[page h841]] chimney rock. chimney rock was the place that marks the halfway point across america. when the settlers crossed the great country, when they got to chimney rock, they knew that they were halfway along their journey. in the shadow of that rock, just this last december, i was in a duck blind with justice scalia who, as we all know, had that as an avocation. when you spend a couple of days in a duck blind with somebody, it is a bonding experience. you get to know them more personally. in my own reflections about what chimney rock meant to the country, a bridge between the past and the future, i thought it appropriately captured the character, the nature, the wisdom of the great justice. he was a great student of american history, our legal system, a great protector of the constitution and precedents. he understood how important it was to act in a consistent manner with principle while looking forward and applying that principle in ever-changing circumstances of american life. because he did so with continuity and with consistency, he was a man of great integrity. his inner voice matched his outer voice. when we saw this beautiful outpouring of support at his funeral from people all across the political aisle, i think the common narrative there was a deep respect for this great man. mr. speaker, when he died, i felt like america lost her grandfather. he was a soaring intellect, had an incisive wit, and had in a certain sense a humble personality. he loved to share a joke. for me to have the privilege of spending some time in a personal intimate setting with him i count as an extraordinary privilege of my time in public service. may god rest his soul. may god grant him peace. may god continue to bless the united states of america and give us all the strength to continue to think through how we are going to elevate and form the next generation of americans who can apply themselves in such an extraordinary, sacrificial way as justice scalia did. i remember one other comment i wanted to leave with you. i remember when the justice asked me: how many children do you have? you beautifully talked about how he was so devoted to his family and faith. he asked me, knowing that i knew he had nine, he asked me how many children. i said: i have five. he paused. he said: respectable. that was it. i thank the gentlewoman from virginia for her beautiful remarks and for giving me this moment to honor this great american. mrs. comstock. i thank the gentleman for his lovely remarks. five is a good start, right, getting to that nine. i yield to the gentleman from new york (mr. king). mr. king of new york. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. i especially thank her for arranging this special order tonight in memory of justice scalia, who was truly a legal giant. he was a man who surpassed all of the intellects that i have been aware of in my lifetime. certainly no one in the legal profession has demonstrated more of a love for the law, more respect for the law, and more respect for the original intent of the constitution. now, i have nowhere near the personal contact with justice scalia that the gentlewoman from virginia (mrs. comstock) did or the gentleman from nebraska (mr. fortenberry). i did meet him on a number of occasions. i had the opportunity to speak with him. usually our conversations consisted of talking about the fact that we lived in working class neighborhoods in queens. we grew up about a mile apart from each other. we both attended jesuit high schools. that is about where the comparison ended as far as the jesuit high schools, because he was valedictorian and i was far from it. he was a person who had the strength of somebody from the neighborhood, but he had the scholar's intellect. {time} 1945 he had an intellect that went beyond tremendous intelligence. it was an intellect that was shaped and framed by his deep religious faith and a belief in undiminished, lasting, and immutable principles. that is what reflected throughout his opinions. yet he never let his own feelings or prejudices influence his thinking. that was certainly proven in the flag burning case. if there is anyone who loved his country and would oppose the concept of the act of flag burning, it was justice scalia. yet he upheld the act as an expression of free speech, as much as it pained him. something that many of us in politics and government have a hard time doing is following the letter of the law, following the intent of the law, and following the meaning of the law. somehow, we like to put in our own feelings and beliefs. the fact is justice scalia told us that there is a higher principle than that. also he had such a respect for language. there were no easy words thrown about. there were no escape clauses or phrases. there was an intent and purpose and meaning to everything that he did. to read his opinions, whether in the majority--and knowing that he was in the majority made us feel much better--or in his dissents, you realized, again, how determined he was, how forceful he was, and how committed he was to arriving at the correct decision--one which, again, followed the original intent of the constitution. there were several references by barbara comstock to his funeral service on saturday. again, it was an expression by so many people of their love and respect for such an outstanding human being, a person whom i doubt we will ever see the likes of again--certainly, in our lifetimes. he was a giant of the law. he was a giant of his faith. he was a giant of his country. i am proud to join with all of my colleagues tonight--especially barbara comstock, who arranged this special order-- in honoring the memory of justice scalia and hoping that that memory lives forward to carry out his unmatched love for the law, love for his country, and love for his family and his religion. mrs. comstock. i thank the gentleman from new york for his kind words and for bringing a new york flavor here to such a wonderful man. i yield to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. walker). mr. walker. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman from virginia for taking the initiative to honor such a great man. in 1986, antonin scalia was nominated. i was a junior in high school. i am not sure it really resonated to me at the time what the next 30 years would entail. i believe it is safe to say that not only is he one of the strongest conservative voices of our day, but he could be of all time. i think of his life and i think of the example that he left for all of us, whether in politics or not. it is one thing to be conservative; it is another thing to effective. he showed with his life that he did not have to compromise his principles or his values to be effective. when i look at his peers around him, justice ginsburg many times talked about the friendship and the relationship she had with him. it was genuine. he took justice kagan hunting. he taught her how to hunt. she killed her first big deer with justice scalia at her side. what does that tell me? it tells me something that we need to remember: you can connect with people, you can hold your values, but you can have a genuine love for your fellow man. there is much to be said about antonin scalia's faith. obviously, he lived it, but he lived it in a way that set an example for all of us. yes, we get frustrated. it is okay to be angry--sometimes vertically, but never horizontally--with our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors, and our family. he set the mark. he set it high. he was someone that could work in, arguably, the toughest environment in the world, yet still gain the respect of his political archrivals. for that, i thank him. tonight, i honor him for showing us how to be both conservative and effective. mrs. comstock. i thank the gentleman for his remarks. i yield to the gentleman from illinois (mr. roskam). mr. roskam. mr. speaker, i thank representative comstock for organizing this tonight. i just have a quick personal story, mr. speaker. justice scalia's daughter, ann, lives in my neighborhood. i served in the state legislature, and i learned that this woman whose last name, obviously, was no longer scalia, was the [[page h842]] daughter of justice scalia. so i called her up, and i said: if your dad is ever in town, i would love to meet him. i was that guy, mr. speaker, who made that call, and she was very gracious. sometime later, she called me up and said: peter, my dad is coming in. why don't you and your family stop by. so the roskams ran around the corner. my wife, elizabeth, myself, and my four children, who were young at the time, went over and spent a few minutes on a sunday afternoon with justice scalia. he was very magnanimous and very gracious in his blue jeans and sweatshirt, getting up off the couch, but extending himself to us. a couple of years later, i won a seat in the u.s. house. i thought: well, i have got a little bit of a connection. i will reach out and call him and try to make a courtesy call. i made some contact with his chambers and his staff and they said: well, would you like to come over and listen to an argument? as a new member of congress, i said: i would love to go over. so, over i go and listen to an argument in the supreme court. it is very dramatic, as you know. i was walking out feeling a little bit let down because i actually wanted to say hello to justice scalia. but not to be disappointed, his staff said: come on with us. so i went up to his office, and there in his chambers he set out a lunch. the two of us had lunch together. now, who i was having lunch with was not lost on me. the magnitude, the scale, the capacity of this man and his ability to influence things on a grand scale was not lost on me. yet he was really willing to spend some time with me that day. i have got to tell you one other quick story. a few years ago, i invited him to dinner. i said: justice scalia, i have got a number of my colleagues that would love to have dinner with you. would you be willing to come out? of course, he did. i told my wife afterward: this guy is so interesting and so charming, if he had a radio show, you would listen to it. you would set your timer so that you could listen to him. he was so interesting, so cleaver, and so quick and willing to take all kinds of questions and all kinds of debate and so forth. i just want to close by saying this. there are many, many times when we feel overwhelmed by events that are before us in our public life. there are many times when our constituents feel overwhelmed and they get this sense of: is there anybody out there that has got some level of judgment and wisdom and capacity here? are there any examples and role models? the answer is: justice scalia. he is an example. he is an example that we are all the beneficiaries of: his clear mind; his capacity to disagree without being disagreeable; his capacity to build people up; his capacity to articulate a world view; his capacity to be a faithful and vocal follower of his savior, jesus, and not be defensive about it; and to basically invite people along to celebrate and to participate in this great gift, which is our democracy. even in these short interactions that i had with him, you always got the sense--or, i did--that he got the joke. in other words, there was a twinkle in his eye. this is a democracy and we have got roles to play. his role on the court was to do his thing. our role, mr. speaker, is to legislate with that same sense of commitment and character and tenacity and clarity that justice scalia brought to his role on the judiciary. so, i want to honor justice scalia. i want to honor his wife, mrs. scalia. i want to honor his children and grandchildren. i thank them, because it is a sacrifice for them to have someone of that caliber and that capacity in that role for our country. it is not a burden that is easy, but they have been willing to bear that burden. our country is better off for it. mrs. comstock. i thank the gentleman for those lovely memories. in the outpouring that we saw in his passing, one of the pictures that i saw from a neighbor was a picture of justice scalia, who was probably coming home for a long day at work, and some children on our street had a lemonade stand. he had stopped and gotten out there to support those little entrepreneurs. the mom came out and took a picture of them. he was there beaming with those kids, in his suit, all dressed up, and these little kids are there with their lemonade stand and so proud. he really did take the time that my friend, mr. roskam, spoke about and really just engaged and loved life so much. i yield to the gentleman from florida (mr. desantis). mr. desantis. i thank my colleague from virginia for organizing this fitting tribute to somebody who really, really did make a difference. very few people who serve not only in the judiciary, but really at any level of government, leave the lasting mark that antonin scalia did. he will join the likes of john marshall, joseph story, and robert jackson as one of the all-time greats in american law. i think of all the great things you can say about him. he was sharp, he was witty, and he wrote brilliantly. i think the reason why he is a titan of modern american law is because he insisted on discharging the judicial duty in a way that strengthened our overall constitutional order. he insisted on textualism when you are interpreting statutes. he had an originalist outlook when you are talking about the constitutional interpretation. those frames of reference really vindicated the separation of powers. the judicial power under article iii is to decide cases and controversy. so you have cases before you that you have got to decide. it is not to go out and be a roving superlegislature. it is not to impose your philosophy on society. you decide cases. so, once judges free their decisionmaking from the objective meaning of the law in the constitution, they are taking away power belonging to the american people that should be exercised through their representatives. justice scalia always understood that. he was always insistent that judges have an objective standard when they are discharging their duty. when you talk about textualism, you read the statute for what it says. you don't correct the statute. you don't amend the statute. you don't find subjective views of some random legislature who happened to say something in a committee hearing. you actually apply the words as written. that is the judicial task. when you do that, you are basically vindicating the power of the congress and of the people's elected representatives, because they are the ones that wrote the law. if the courts depart from that, then they are departing from what the elected representatives did. i am sure he saw countless statutes that were asinine as a matter of policy, but he said: that is not my job to correct that. so he is absolutely vindicating the separation of powers in the constitutional order. the same thing with constitutional interpretation. before justice scalia took the bench, this was a freewheeling thing. judges would say: society matures and it is up to us to, effectively, update the meaning of the constitution. that means you have five lawyers--unelected, unaccountable--that serve as an effective roving constitutional convention that can change the constitution based on one case that happens to come in front of them. that was something that justice scalia thought was totally outside the bounds of the proper judicial role. he says the constitution has a fixed, enduring meaning, and it is our job as judges to ascertain that meaning and apply it to the cases and controversies before us. so, if you look at a figure that has had more impact on how we think about the law and the constitution over the last 50 years, you are not going to find one that surpasses justice antonin scalia. he was a great american in every respect. he fought the good fight. he finished the race. he kept the faith. what a good guy. what a life. mrs. comstock. i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. rothfus). mr. rothfus. i thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from virginia, for organizing this special order on behalf of this remarkable, remarkable american. on february 13 of this year, our country lost a giant. his legacy will [[page h843]] never fade. justice scalia influenced countless jurists, attorneys, law students, and everyday americans. my thoughts and prayers have been with his wife, maureen, father paul, and the entire scalia family since the passing of this outstanding american statesman. regardless of whether one agreed with his opinions on the supreme court, this man's consistent integrity and admirable character cannot be denied. in both word and action, he was a man of the strongest character and deepest virtue. {time} 2000 this was evident in the commencement address he gave to the graduating class of the college of william and mary in 1996, when he said: ``bear in mind that brains and learning, like muscle and physical skill, are articles of commerce. they are bought and sold. you can hire them by the year or by the hour. the only thing in the world that is not for sale is character.'' the way he lived out the virtues of integrity and humility did not go unnoticed. several weeks ago, we here in washington had the opportunity to go to the national prayer breakfast, which attracted members of congress, the president, senators, ambassadors, people from all over the world, and we were treated with an appearance by famed tenor andrea bocelli. i think that justice scalia would have enjoyed his appearance and his appreciation for opera. in addition to his wonderful renditions of ``panis angelicus,'' which, again would have been another treat for justice scalia, and ``amazing grace,'' mr. bocelli lamented the dark shadow that war casts on the world and expressed concern for its victims, identifying war as a major problem in our world today. but then it was interesting. mr. bocelli stated: ``there is that small, hateful word, `hubris,' already known in antiquity.'' the ancient greeks used it to define pride and the arrogance it entails. bocelli's use of the word ``hubris'' was compelling in that he spoke it in the center of power here in the united states. that word conjures a theme that we have seen in justice scalia's work. justice scalia went about his task of considering significant constitutional and legal issues of the day with a profound and seldom seen humility about the role of courts in our country. they are not there to impose their own beliefs on the people, but to adjudicate competing claims in the context of a constitution that has enduring meaning. to interpret the law in any other way otherwise aggrandizes power to a select few, a power that was never intended by the founders. this humility of position that justice scalia had i believe will be a lasting legacy. regardless of whether one agrees with justice scalia from a policy perspective, his writings reflect a profound respect for an understanding of our system of government and an unparalleled respect for an interpretation of the constitution grounded in text and in history. for this our nation should be forever grateful. may he rest in peace. mrs. comstock. i thank the gentleman, and i thank all of my colleagues for their comments. mr. speaker, i really appreciate this opportunity for all of our colleagues to join us in celebrating the life of this great man, justice scalia, who so many of us were privileged to know and count as a friend. for anyone who would like to view the beautiful mass of christian burial for justice scalia that was presided over by his son, father paul scalia, who gave a beautiful homily, that can be found on c-span. i appreciate that that was covered. i also, again, appreciate this opportunity to celebrate this beautiful life, this family. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",32600
CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgH843,CREC-2016-02-23,114,WATER QUALITY AND SUPPLY ISSUES IN THE UNITED STATES,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H843-H847] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WATER QUALITY AND SUPPLY ISSUES IN THE UNITED STATES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the earlier discussion about one of America's most longstanding and most noted Justices. His passing is mourned by all of us. I do, however, today want to move to a different subject. I want to talk about, I think, one of the two most essential things that a human being needs to live. That is water and air. But today we are going to take the former of those two subjects and really talk about water. Two weeks ago I put this up for all to see. This is tap water from Flint, Michigan. There has been a lot of discussion over the last month, month and a half, almost 3 months now, about Flint, Michigan, about the water supply in Flint, Michigan, lead in the pipes, lead pipes, about the public health emergency that exists there, and about what we could and should do about dealing with Flint, Michigan. However, Flint, Michigan is not unique. This is how they get water in East Porterville. In the Central Valley of California, the San Joaquin Valley, just south of Fresno, California, the water supplies in the East Porterville area ran dry, in part, because of the drought, in part, because of inadequate water systems. So the residents of East Porterville were required to get water from a cattle water trough, pretty much like I have on my ranch, although, hopefully, this water is a whole lot cleaner. Porterville, California. Now we have two examples, one from the Midwest, another one from the Far West. Any other problems about water supply? Well, yes. There are other problems about water supply. This is a list of problems that we know exist in the United States-- or most recently existed: Flint, Michigan, we just saw that picture. Toledo, Ohio, you remember, had to shut down the water system because of problems from algae blooms. Sebring, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; Brick Township, New Jersey; Washington, D.C., lead release. Wayne County, North Carolina; Greenville, North Carolina; Lakehurst Acres, Maine; Chicago, Illinois. I decided not to put them all up there because it would take the rest of the evening to list all the communities in America that have water issues. And certainly we do in California. I could put up another--well, maybe I will. Let me just put up a map of California. This is the largest population in the United States, approaching 40 million people. And far north, the Pacific Coast, San Francisco Bay, Los Angeles, down here, Santa Barbara, and way down here, San Diego, and somewhere over here, Arizona and Nevada, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the coastal range, and the great Central Valley of California, where a whole lot of America's food and food exports come from. Down here in the Tulare Lake Basin, there are well over 100 communities who have contaminated water from nitrates and other harmful substances. So the issue of clean water, you know, shortage of water down here, and contaminated wells up and down--oh. The Salinas Valley. Monterey Bay and the great Salinas Valley, many, many of the wells in that area are also contaminated. So we have got a water quality problem really throughout the United States, and we certainly have one in California. We have another problem in California. Let me put this up, a little different map. The previous map, that one, nice and green. That is not California today. We may be and probably are in the fifth year of the great California drought. This is a picture of the California drought situation. The yellow is a little less than normal. The red, far less than normal. This brown is really the way California will be as soon as this summer comes on. And that is called exceptional drought. So the great Central Valley of California, the coastal range down into Los Angeles, even over to the east side of the Sierras, an exceptional drought. So the green California is really not so green. Today we are about halfway through the rainy season in California, and the [[Page H844]] current rain for the entire State is about 75 percent of normal. That is why you see this extreme drought occurring even as of February 18, 2016. The Sierra snowpack is less than normal but is still a whole lot better than last year, when it was zero, as in no snow. So what are we going to do? Well, we need to do something. Otherwise, we are going to have a whole lot more pain in California. So what Senator Feinstein and I have been doing over the last several months is trying to develop a solution for the immediate drought, to make the most of the water that is available, while still protecting the endangered species, the great salmon runs of the Central Valley of California, and the coastal rivers, as well as the species that live in the delta of California. So we have been working, trying to put together a piece of legislation that would provide as much flexibility as possible, while still protecting the fish species and the flora and fauna of the State. We think we have done it. We think we do have a piece of legislation that will do that. We call that the operational portion of the legislation. Senator Feinstein has already introduced that legislation. I intend to do so in the very near future here in the House of Representatives so that we can have a statement from the House of Representatives about how we can solve the drought problem--well, not solve it--do the very best we can in an extreme circumstance to deliver as much water as possible to the farms and the cities of all of California, while also protecting the endangered species. Let me just put this up. This is the essence of the legislation. I am going to start here at the bottom and work towards the top. This is the short-term provision of the bill. I will go into this in more detail in a few moments. The bill also has what we call long-term infrastructure needs. Those long-term infrastructure needs are storage reservoirs, aquifers beneath the surface of the earth, where we have groundwater--or we used to have groundwater, surface storage. There are several new and expanded reservoir opportunities available in the State, some of them on the streams and rivers--and, of course, those will be controversial--and one or two that are off-stream, in the valleys and the mountains where there are no active rivers, those being somewhat less controversial. So there is surface storage. There is underground aquifer storage. That is this one right here. Authorized $600 million for water storage projects, both aquifer as well as surface storage. We also have this thing called conservation. Conservation is where you can get the most water. For every gallon of water that you conserve, that is a gallon of water that would be available for other purposes or to extend what little you have available. So conservation plays a major role. In this legislation, there is money for conservation. There is also money for this recycling. Now, much of the Midwest recycles water. In fact, the entire Mississippi River system is recycled water, water that is used upstream by some city, cleaned, put back in the river, reused again as it flows down the Mississippi River and its tributaries. California doesn't do much recycling. I don't have a map here of the--no, I don't. But if one were to take a look at the whole Pacific Coast of California and the United States and Alaska and Central America and South America--so from Alaska all the way south to Chile on the West Coast, the Pacific Coast, of the Western Hemisphere--you would find that the fifth biggest river in all of that vast stretch--the great rivers of Alaska and Canada, the Columbia River, the Sacramento River, the Colorado River down here, and the rivers of Central and South America--the fifth biggest happens to be right here, here, here, and here. {time} 2015 The fifth biggest rivers are the sanitation plants of California that take water from up and down the entire area and from the Colorado all the way from the Rockies, use it, clean it to a higher standard than the day it arrives in the great cities of California, clean it to a higher standard, and then they dump it in the ocean. This is utter foolishness. So in the Garamendi-Feinstein legislation, we have $200 million for water recycling so that we can recycle that water, reuse it, and make use of water that is already available. We know, for example, that in Los Angeles there are approximately 1 million acre-feet of water that is not now being used. In fact, it is being dumped into the ocean. With this recycling program, 1 million acre-feet of new water can be available in southern California. And, by the way, for those of you who are not familiar with California, we are talking about the Los Angeles basin here. So the recycling in this basin can deliver 1 million acre-feet of water over the next decade or so, and that water can be put back into the great aquifers of southern California and even down into the San Diego area. These aquifers are now largely contaminated with various contaminants, but they can be cleaned and the water recycled, put back in the aquifers, taken out, cleaned, and round and round it goes. One million acre-feet: What does that mean to northern California, to Colorado, our friends in Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada? It means that that is a million acre-feet that Los Angeles, the great basin down here, does not need to take from the Sacramento River in northern California or from the Colorado River, taking pressure off those rivers. And as you saw from the drought map, those rivers are in severe trouble. So that is kind of a strategy that we put in place. Now, we are not geniuses--well, maybe--no. We are not geniuses. But what we do know is that the State of California has already figured this out. So what our legislation does is to tie directly to, mirror, augment, and push forward what California did in the 2014 election, which is to pass proposition 1, an almost $7 billion proposition for the development of water supplies for California. So, look at this: Water conservation, storm water recapturing, increase local and regional supplies, $810 million. Our legislation would fit right in there with conservation and these other programs. Safe drinking water. Remember talking about Porterville and water troughs for cattle from which the kids were taking water? Here you have the Safe Drinking Water Program. And guess what. It is in the Feinstein-Garamendi legislation. Yes. There it is, money to help small communities through the Bureau of Reclamation expanding their WaterSMART and other programs so that we can mirror, augment, supplement, and advance what California already wants to do when proposition 1 goes into effect. Let's see. Water recycling. Didn't I just talk about that? Yes, I did. So in the legislation that Senator Feinstein has already introduced and what I will soon introduce here, we will be once again working with the water recycling. Not as much money, but still a major Federal effort to work with the State to maximize the water recycling. This is also not on this list, but also desalinization, which happens to work for some parts of California as well as other parts of the United States. I talked about groundwater. Yes. Our legislation mirrors the groundwater program that is in proposition 1, adds some additional money, and directs the Federal Government to work directly with the State on advancing the groundwater issues. Now, for those of you that have been following the drought in California over the last several years--actually, the last several decades--California has been excessively using its groundwater so much so that, in parts of the great Central Valley of California--maybe I will put that map back up here--in the great Central Valley of California, particularly in this part of the Central Valley and the Fresno area and south, we have seen a significant fall in the surface of the Earth. It is literally sinking as a result of the groundwater being pumped out. In many places, you can go down through this area and you will see wells that are way, way above the ground and the ground is down here maybe 10, 20 feet. You have seen subsidence in the area. So the over-drafting in this area and some in the Sacramento Valley as well as in the Salinas Valley is a serious problem. Part of what we want to do, mirroring what the State has already decided to do with proposition 1, is to [[Page H845]] have the Federal Government work with the State on addressing the aquifers in this region to find ways to recharge the aquifers. There are many different ways that that can be done. Some of it is simply pumping the water back into the ground rather than pumping it out. In other areas, the geology in various parts, particularly along the coastal mountains as well as along the Sierra Nevada mountains, there are gravel channels, old river channels that have historically recharged the groundwater basins in parts--actually, along most of the Central Valley. So it has to be done. This is what we are trying to do with this legislation: Desalination research, which I discussed earlier, $100 million; water storage, $600 million; water recycling, $200 million; and $55 million for specific protections for the fish and wildlife species. There is a whole series of projects that would fit into that. Once again, all of this infrastructure work is designed to coordinate specifically with what the State of California is doing with their multibillion-dollar proposition 1. This isn't in effect yet, but this money is now working its way through the various environmental studies and various levels of government so that very soon these projects will be underway. If we are able to pass the legislation that we want to introduce, we are going to see the Federal Government working very, very closely with the State government in addressing the California problem. Now, who cares about California? If you care about food, your fresh veggies, you had better care about California. Over here in the Salinas Valley where lettuce comes from? Drought problems. In the Central Valley, let's see. You name the crop, everything from rice to walnuts--oh, wine grapes are very, very important if you like your wine. In the central coast down here, the same thing. So what we are trying to do with the legislation is to provide a long-term fix to California so that we can increase the supply of water, increase the storage during the wet years, put the storage in reservoirs and in the aquifers so that, when the dry years come, then we will do it. There was a fellow by the name of Steinbeck. He wrote a book, ``East of Eden.'' In that book, he talked about the California droughts. This is not a new situation, although 5 years and 4 years is definitely new. Usually, the droughts would be 1 or 2 years. But now we are looking at quite possibly a 5-year drought. Steinbeck said this. It is not the exact quote, although I wish I had it. It was like this: In the dry years, they worried about where their water would come from. Then the wet years would come and they forgot about the dry years. That has been the story of California for too many--too many-- decades. Certainly Steinbeck saw that in the early part of the 20th century. We are now in the 21st century and we cannot--we cannot--relive that old adage that Steinbeck wrote about. So we need to build for the future. We need to be able to address this in the immediate as best we can and put in place the water systems. I am going to describe those water systems to you just very briefly. Here in the north we have the great Shasta Reservoir up here on the Upper Sacramento River. It could be raised. It could be increased. There are some environmental and certainly some cost issues associated with raising Shasta. That is one of the proposals of possibilities in our legislation. The other one sits right about in here off stream. The Sacramento River flows down through the middle of the valley here, but off-stream over here in my district actually is a potential reservoir that has been talked about for maybe 50 years now called Sites Reservoir. It stores about 1.8 million acre-feet of water. It could deliver annually 500,000 acre-feet of water. That is a lot of water. That is 1 foot of water across 5,000 acres. Did I say 5,000? It is 500,000 acres. So that is the Sites Reservoir over here. That reservoir also does something really unique. Since it is off- river, it will take the water flowing down the Sacramento River during the heavy storms, put that water into the reservoir, and then, when summer comes or the drought comes, that water can be released back into the Sacramento River, providing water quality issues here in the Delta of California--and I will come to that in just a few moments--creating flexibility on the great reservoirs--Shasta, the Yuba system, the Folsom Reservoir here in Sacramento, and the big California reservoir in Oroville--allowing the operations of those reservoirs to be modified in such a way that they are able to store water rather than releasing it down the river for fish and wildlife. It would then be able to release water from Sites Reservoir and keep that water back in these reservoirs. A major problem in Sacramento is that the Folsom Reservoir is at low tide. I will have tomorrow representatives from the east Sacramento area in my office, all of them saying: Oh, my goodness. We don't have enough water in Folsom Reservoir for our cities of Rancho Cordova, Roseville, and the like, east of Sacramento. So Sites Reservoir could provide more water in the Sacramento region by keeping that water in the Folsom Reservoir. Let's talk a little bit about the delta. I guess I had better finish the other reservoirs. Down here in the Fresno area on the San Joaquin River we have the big Friant Reservoir on the San Joaquin. There is a bit of a problem with Friant. It managed to dry up the San Joaquin River, creating a big, big problem for the salmon. They don't do very well in dry rivers. So there is an effort underway to try to restore some of the salmon on the rivers in the San Joaquin Valley, the Stanislaus, the Merced, and the other rivers as you move down towards the San Joaquin. There would be a new reservoir that is proposed here at Temperance Flat. Is it possible? Yes. Is it environmentally controversial? Oh, yeah. No doubt about that. And it is expensive. But, nonetheless, our legislation would authorize a continuation of the studies to see if it is worth doing. So that would be the Temperance Flat. Over here on the hills to the east of Oakland there is another storage reservoir off-stream, and that one is called Los Vaqueros. Los Vaqueros is a reservoir that is controlled by the Contra Costa Water District. They now have agreements with other water districts in the bay area to increase the size of that reservoir to store more water at that area. Again, that is off-stream. It would take the high winter flows and put that water in storage off-stream as with Sites Reservoir to the north of it, all very, very important. So these are the essential projects that would be long term for California. Again, they would be the surface storage reservoirs, two off-stream and three potentially on-stream. They would be recharging the aquifers and the various infrastructure needed to do that, recycling in the great cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, and in the bay area to recycle water and, also, dealing with the contamination that occurs in many of the cities in the Central Valley, the San Joaquin Valley particularly, a little bit up here in the Sacramento Valley, and a lot of problems in the Salinas Valley in this area. So those are the essential elements of the long term--I forgot conservation and desalination. So those are the long-term projects that are both in proposition 1 of the California water bond of 2014 and, also, in our legislation. The second piece of the legislation deals with the operation of the two great water projects. These are the largest water projects in the world, although China is building one that might actually be bigger. But, as of today, the largest water projects in the world are in California. What they basically do--maybe I will back up here a bit. It would be great if my colleagues here really had a sense of what is happening. The basic water projects of California take the water from the Sacramento Valley, the Sacramento River, Mount Shasta up here, and the Trinity River, bring that water in through the Shasta Reservoir, hold the water there, and then send the water down the Sacramento River to the delta. [[Page H846]] {time} 2030 From the delta, that water is picked up in canals--two of them, one operated by the Federal Government, the other one operated by the State of California--and brings that water--the Federal Government--down into the San Joaquin Valley, where it provides hundreds of thousands of acres of irrigated agricultural production. The other part of that project is here on the San Joaquin. That takes water down the east side of the valley, all the way to Kern County, down here in the Bakersfield area, and north up into the Madera County area here. That is called the Friant-Kern system. That is the Federal water project. The State water project, like the Federal, takes the water out of the delta here and brings it down in the canal, all the way down here, providing water to Kern County, and then pumps that water 2,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains through tunnels and canals into southern California. It flows down through the western part of the Mohave Desert down here, and then flows into the Los Angeles area, and also into the Palm Springs area all the way over here. That is the California water project. Some of that water flowing into the Metropolitan Water District is then available for the cities and water districts of southern California, all the way down to San Diego and into the Coachella Valley over here in the Palm Springs area. It is one huge water project, all of it dependent on the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. There is no other estuary anywhere from Chile to Alaska as large and as important to the aquatic species and birds as the great delta of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system. Unlike many deltas, this is an inland delta. This is the beginning of San Francisco Bay here. It goes on out. The Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco are just further to the west. Once again, the water flows southward down the Sacramento River, past the city of Sacramento, and flows down through the delta, picked up by the great pumps here at Tracy into the canals, and down the canals to the San Joaquin Valley and on to southern California. Here is the problem: the pumping has significantly altered the ecology of the delta and, when coupled with the drought, has created a situation that has led to a very serious potential of the extinction of species in the delta, particularly the delta smelt. Because of the alteration of the Sacramento River system's normal flow, the salmon, which would normally migrate up the Sacramento River all the way to Mount Shasta and beyond or down the San Joaquin River system to Fresno, that migration pattern has been seriously altered. In normal years, the management of the river is such that the salmon are able to get along, not as well as they once did when it was said you could walk across the river on the back of salmon--you can't do that today for sure--but, nonetheless, in a normal year these river systems, excluding the Lower San Joaquin, are able to produce a significant salmon run. In the delta, the delta smelt have been under great pressure since the pumps were put in. The smelt is a little, tiny fish, but it happens to be like the foundation fish--all the bigger fish eat it. And it is also what we call the canary in the coal mine. If you remember what that is all about, you use canaries in a coal mine. When the canary keels over, you have got a serious problem because you are the next to keel over--bad air. Well, here these delta smelt are considered to be the canary in the water. When they are in deep trouble--and they are today--the question arises: Is the entire ecosystem of the delta going to collapse? We think not. But California is severely stressed. California is still in drought. Today, the rainfall in California is 75 percent of normal. That is for the entire State. For the Sacramento region, February is 22 percent of normal, and I think we are rapidly approaching the end of February. What that means for the delta is extraordinary stress--extraordinary stress--and a monumental California water fight. My great-grandfather came to California in the 1860s to mine for gold. During that time, there was a fellow out there by the name of Mark Twain, who was writing about the gold rush and other things that were going on in California. He said a couple of things that are really interesting. About San Francisco, he said that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in San Francisco. I think he was referring to the fog. He also said that in California in the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, he said: ``Whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over.'' So it has been. During the Gold Rush period, it was all about water. You couldn't mine for gold unless you had water, and people fought over water. They built incredible systems to get their hands on the water that came out of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Today, it is the same. We still fight about water. What Senator Feinstein and I are trying to do is to reduce the friction, reduce the fighting that has been going on for the last decade, or last 5 years, about water as it flows through the delta. My San Joaquin Valley colleagues, Democrat and Republican, have put forth two pieces of legislation that they believe would solve the water problem for them. What they have managed to do with that legislation is to basically wipe out the environmental protection for the species-- salmon, smelt, and other species in the delta--and simply say: Turn the pumps on. We need the water. We have got the votes. We are going to get the water. Those two pieces of legislation have not become law, and they never should become law, because if they did, the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere would be in serious jeopardy. What we propose is to work within the environmental laws and the biological opinions that have been put forth by the Federal and State fish and wildlife agencies and the National Marine Fisheries Service-- the National Marine Fisheries Service concerned about the salmon; the fish and wildlife agencies concerned about the endemic species of the delta--to work within those biological opinions which are designed to protect those species and say the flexibility that is allowed under the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the biological opinions are sufficient to allow for the maximum amount of pumping to the south from the delta consistent with the protection of the species. In order to accomplish that, we need to use science. The biological opinions are based on about 13- to 15-year-old science. What we are saying in our legislation is ramp up the science. Senator Feinstein was able to deliver $100 million to California fish agencies to put in place realtime monitoring. She was not able to write how that could occur, so in the legislation we would direct the agencies to conduct real-time monitoring, daily monitoring. As the winter flows--and there have been winter flows thus far this year, not enough, but they are there. As those winter flows enter the delta from the north and the south, the fish agencies study where are the smelt, where are the salmon coming down the Sacramento River, and also from the San Joaquin River. If they are near the delta pumps, reduce the pumping, or don't pump at all, depending where those fish are. If they are not, if they have moved away from the pumps and there is water in the system, then turn the pumps on. Pretty simple: if the fish are endangered, reduce the pumping; if the fish are not endangered, then increase the pumping. That is essentially what our legislation would accomplish. There are other elements to it, for example, putting in fish screens at the Delta Cross Channel on the Georgiana Slough, and also to improve the levee system within the delta. We will see. We will see what happens here. We have a choice as Members of Congress and men and women that are supposed to solve problems. We can go the way of my San Joaquin Valley colleagues and simply push aside, negate, the environmental laws that provide for the protection of the salmon, the great fishing industry of California, the salmon runs up and down the coast. By the way, the salmon that come out of the Sacramento River provide salmon all the way to the Columbia River in Oregon. So it is not just about San Francisco Bay. It is about the salmon and the fishing industry for much of the West Coast, also south through Monterey Bay. [[Page H847]] Can we wipe out the environmental laws and simply turn the pumps on? Yes, if that legislation were to pass that has been offered by my colleagues from the San Joaquin Valley. Or we can work within the environmental laws, achieving maximum flexibility, understanding the science: Where are the salmon or the salmonoids? Those are the salmon that have hatched and are coming back down the river, little, tiny salmon. Where are they? Are they coming down the river and getting sucked to the pumps, or are they coming down the river and heading out to the bay? We don't know today. We are not doing real-time monitoring. If we did real-time monitoring, we would know where they are. We would know where the delta smelt are and other species, and we could adjust the pumping to protect the species and to take advantage of the high flows that occur during the normal winters and also this year, even though it is well below normal. I have confidence. I have confidence in the wisdom of the Californians who decided that they would pass a water bond to put in place long-range solutions for California--recycling, conservation, storage systems, underground aquifers--and to develop safe drinking water. I have confidence in the wisdom of California because they voted by over 60 percent for this project. I have confidence in the Congress. I have confidence in the Senate. Senator Feinstein has come up with a good bill. I had the honor to work with her on that bill, and I will soon introduce that bill here in the House. I have confidence that we have the wisdom and we have the understanding of the systems of California water to maximize over time the water potential of California. And in the near term, in the near term when California, this great State that we would like to see as green, when California is faced with this, I have got confidence that we are wise enough and we are smart enough politically to maneuver ourselves into a situation where we can address the current drought to the maximum extent possible, delivering water to the San Joaquin Valley and on into southern California without harming the fish, without destroying the salmon of California and the fishing, the multibillion- dollar fishing industry that goes with it, and without jeopardizing the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. That is our challenge. This is what we are going to try to accomplish. Senator Feinstein's bill has been introduced. That version will be introduced over here in the next several days as we develop a better understanding among my colleagues of what we are trying to accomplish here. {time} 2045 I have confidence that the representatives of the southern California area will see the wisdom of putting aside what Mark Twain said we always do in California: Fighting over water and getting about drinking more whiskey. Probably a pretty good idea. I think we are going to get southern California support for this. I think the San Joaquin Valley folks will look at this and say: Well, we can continue fighting as we have for the last 5 years with no progress, none, nada, zero. Let's see if we can figure out how to do this in a way that protects the species, the salmon, the other fish, that protects the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere, and that provides the maximum amount of water that is available to California, which, by the way, has an economy that is ranked seventh in the world. So water is really important. I know we can do better. I know that this Nation doesn't have to have this kind of water in Flint, Michigan. I know that this Nation doesn't have to have children in the Central Valley of California getting their water out of a cattle water trough. I know that this Nation doesn't have to destroy the largest estuary and all of the fish, all of the salmon, and all of the industry that goes with that in its quest for water and that what little is available can be shared and maximized. That is what we are going to try to do with the Feinstein-Garamendi legislation. I know we can do it. I know we have to do it. I know, at the end of the day, we are not going to destroy. We are going to build, we are going to create, and we are going to solve the problem. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H843-H847] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WATER QUALITY AND SUPPLY ISSUES IN THE UNITED STATES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the earlier discussion about one of America's most longstanding and most noted Justices. His passing is mourned by all of us. I do, however, today want to move to a different subject. I want to talk about, I think, one of the two most essential things that a human being needs to live. That is water and air. But today we are going to take the former of those two subjects and really talk about water. Two weeks ago I put this up for all to see. This is tap water from Flint, Michigan. There has been a lot of discussion over the last month, month and a half, almost 3 months now, about Flint, Michigan, about the water supply in Flint, Michigan, lead in the pipes, lead pipes, about the public health emergency that exists there, and about what we could and should do about dealing with Flint, Michigan. However, Flint, Michigan is not unique. This is how they get water in East Porterville. In the Central Valley of California, the San Joaquin Valley, just south of Fresno, California, the water supplies in the East Porterville area ran dry, in part, because of the drought, in part, because of inadequate water systems. So the residents of East Porterville were required to get water from a cattle water trough, pretty much like I have on my ranch, although, hopefully, this water is a whole lot cleaner. Porterville, California. Now we have two examples, one from the Midwest, another one from the Far West. Any other problems about water supply? Well, yes. There are other problems about water supply. This is a list of problems that we know exist in the United States-- or most recently existed: Flint, Michigan, we just saw that picture. Toledo, Ohio, you remember, had to shut down the water system because of problems from algae blooms. Sebring, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; Brick Township, New Jersey; Washington, D.C., lead release. Wayne County, North Carolina; Greenville, North Carolina; Lakehurst Acres, Maine; Chicago, Illinois. I decided not to put them all up there because it would take the rest of the evening to list all the communities in America that have water issues. And certainly we do in California. I could put up another--well, maybe I will. Let me just put up a map of California. This is the largest population in the United States, approaching 40 million people. And far north, the Pacific Coast, San Francisco Bay, Los Angeles, down here, Santa Barbara, and way down here, San Diego, and somewhere over here, Arizona and Nevada, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the coastal range, and the great Central Valley of California, where a whole lot of America's food and food exports come from. Down here in the Tulare Lake Basin, there are well over 100 communities who have contaminated water from nitrates and other harmful substances. So the issue of clean water, you know, shortage of water down here, and contaminated wells up and down--oh. The Salinas Valley. Monterey Bay and the great Salinas Valley, many, many of the wells in that area are also contaminated. So we have got a water quality problem really throughout the United States, and we certainly have one in California. We have another problem in California. Let me put this up, a little different map. The previous map, that one, nice and green. That is not California today. We may be and probably are in the fifth year of the great California drought. This is a picture of the California drought situation. The yellow is a little less than normal. The red, far less than normal. This brown is really the way California will be as soon as this summer comes on. And that is called exceptional drought. So the great Central Valley of California, the coastal range down into Los Angeles, even over to the east side of the Sierras, an exceptional drought. So the green California is really not so green. Today we are about halfway through the rainy season in California, and the [[Page H844]] current rain for the entire State is about 75 percent of normal. That is why you see this extreme drought occurring even as of February 18, 2016. The Sierra snowpack is less than normal but is still a whole lot better than last year, when it was zero, as in no snow. So what are we going to do? Well, we need to do something. Otherwise, we are going to have a whole lot more pain in California. So what Senator Feinstein and I have been doing over the last several months is trying to develop a solution for the immediate drought, to make the most of the water that is available, while still protecting the endangered species, the great salmon runs of the Central Valley of California, and the coastal rivers, as well as the species that live in the delta of California. So we have been working, trying to put together a piece of legislation that would provide as much flexibility as possible, while still protecting the fish species and the flora and fauna of the State. We think we have done it. We think we do have a piece of legislation that will do that. We call that the operational portion of the legislation. Senator Feinstein has already introduced that legislation. I intend to do so in the very near future here in the House of Representatives so that we can have a statement from the House of Representatives about how we can solve the drought problem--well, not solve it--do the very best we can in an extreme circumstance to deliver as much water as possible to the farms and the cities of all of California, while also protecting the endangered species. Let me just put this up. This is the essence of the legislation. I am going to start here at the bottom and work towards the top. This is the short-term provision of the bill. I will go into this in more detail in a few moments. The bill also has what we call long-term infrastructure needs. Those long-term infrastructure needs are storage reservoirs, aquifers beneath the surface of the earth, where we have groundwater--or we used to have groundwater, surface storage. There are several new and expanded reservoir opportunities available in the State, some of them on the streams and rivers--and, of course, those will be controversial--and one or two that are off-stream, in the valleys and the mountains where there are no active rivers, those being somewhat less controversial. So there is surface storage. There is underground aquifer storage. That is this one right here. Authorized $600 million for water storage projects, both aquifer as well as surface storage. We also have this thing called conservation. Conservation is where you can get the most water. For every gallon of water that you conserve, that is a gallon of water that would be available for other purposes or to extend what little you have available. So conservation plays a major role. In this legislation, there is money for conservation. There is also money for this recycling. Now, much of the Midwest recycles water. In fact, the entire Mississippi River system is recycled water, water that is used upstream by some city, cleaned, put back in the river, reused again as it flows down the Mississippi River and its tributaries. California doesn't do much recycling. I don't have a map here of the--no, I don't. But if one were to take a look at the whole Pacific Coast of California and the United States and Alaska and Central America and South America--so from Alaska all the way south to Chile on the West Coast, the Pacific Coast, of the Western Hemisphere--you would find that the fifth biggest river in all of that vast stretch--the great rivers of Alaska and Canada, the Columbia River, the Sacramento River, the Colorado River down here, and the rivers of Central and South America--the fifth biggest happens to be right here, here, here, and here. {time} 2015 The fifth biggest rivers are the sanitation plants of California that take water from up and down the entire area and from the Colorado all the way from the Rockies, use it, clean it to a higher standard than the day it arrives in the great cities of California, clean it to a higher standard, and then they dump it in the ocean. This is utter foolishness. So in the Garamendi-Feinstein legislation, we have $200 million for water recycling so that we can recycle that water, reuse it, and make use of water that is already available. We know, for example, that in Los Angeles there are approximately 1 million acre-feet of water that is not now being used. In fact, it is being dumped into the ocean. With this recycling program, 1 million acre-feet of new water can be available in southern California. And, by the way, for those of you who are not familiar with California, we are talking about the Los Angeles basin here. So the recycling in this basin can deliver 1 million acre-feet of water over the next decade or so, and that water can be put back into the great aquifers of southern California and even down into the San Diego area. These aquifers are now largely contaminated with various contaminants, but they can be cleaned and the water recycled, put back in the aquifers, taken out, cleaned, and round and round it goes. One million acre-feet: What does that mean to northern California, to Colorado, our friends in Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada? It means that that is a million acre-feet that Los Angeles, the great basin down here, does not need to take from the Sacramento River in northern California or from the Colorado River, taking pressure off those rivers. And as you saw from the drought map, those rivers are in severe trouble. So that is kind of a strategy that we put in place. Now, we are not geniuses--well, maybe--no. We are not geniuses. But what we do know is that the State of California has already figured this out. So what our legislation does is to tie directly to, mirror, augment, and push forward what California did in the 2014 election, which is to pass proposition 1, an almost $7 billion proposition for the development of water supplies for California. So, look at this: Water conservation, storm water recapturing, increase local and regional supplies, $810 million. Our legislation would fit right in there with conservation and these other programs. Safe drinking water. Remember talking about Porterville and water troughs for cattle from which the kids were taking water? Here you have the Safe Drinking Water Program. And guess what. It is in the Feinstein-Garamendi legislation. Yes. There it is, money to help small communities through the Bureau of Reclamation expanding their WaterSMART and other programs so that we can mirror, augment, supplement, and advance what California already wants to do when proposition 1 goes into effect. Let's see. Water recycling. Didn't I just talk about that? Yes, I did. So in the legislation that Senator Feinstein has already introduced and what I will soon introduce here, we will be once again working with the water recycling. Not as much money, but still a major Federal effort to work with the State to maximize the water recycling. This is also not on this list, but also desalinization, which happens to work for some parts of California as well as other parts of the United States. I talked about groundwater. Yes. Our legislation mirrors the groundwater program that is in proposition 1, adds some additional money, and directs the Federal Government to work directly with the State on advancing the groundwater issues. Now, for those of you that have been following the drought in California over the last several years--actually, the last several decades--California has been excessively using its groundwater so much so that, in parts of the great Central Valley of California--maybe I will put that map back up here--in the great Central Valley of California, particularly in this part of the Central Valley and the Fresno area and south, we have seen a significant fall in the surface of the Earth. It is literally sinking as a result of the groundwater being pumped out. In many places, you can go down through this area and you will see wells that are way, way above the ground and the ground is down here maybe 10, 20 feet. You have seen subsidence in the area. So the over-drafting in this area and some in the Sacramento Valley as well as in the Salinas Valley is a serious problem. Part of what we want to do, mirroring what the State has already decided to do with proposition 1, is to [[Page H845]] have the Federal Government work with the State on addressing the aquifers in this region to find ways to recharge the aquifers. There are many different ways that that can be done. Some of it is simply pumping the water back into the ground rather than pumping it out. In other areas, the geology in various parts, particularly along the coastal mountains as well as along the Sierra Nevada mountains, there are gravel channels, old river channels that have historically recharged the groundwater basins in parts--actually, along most of the Central Valley. So it has to be done. This is what we are trying to do with this legislation: Desalination research, which I discussed earlier, $100 million; water storage, $600 million; water recycling, $200 million; and $55 million for specific protections for the fish and wildlife species. There is a whole series of projects that would fit into that. Once again, all of this infrastructure work is designed to coordinate specifically with what the State of California is doing with their multibillion-dollar proposition 1. This isn't in effect yet, but this money is now working its way through the various environmental studies and various levels of government so that very soon these projects will be underway. If we are able to pass the legislation that we want to introduce, we are going to see the Federal Government working very, very closely with the State government in addressing the California problem. Now, who cares about California? If you care about food, your fresh veggies, you had better care about California. Over here in the Salinas Valley where lettuce comes from? Drought problems. In the Central Valley, let's see. You name the crop, everything from rice to walnuts--oh, wine grapes are very, very important if you like your wine. In the central coast down here, the same thing. So what we are trying to do with the legislation is to provide a long-term fix to California so that we can increase the supply of water, increase the storage during the wet years, put the storage in reservoirs and in the aquifers so that, when the dry years come, then we will do it. There was a fellow by the name of Steinbeck. He wrote a book, ``East of Eden.'' In that book, he talked about the California droughts. This is not a new situation, although 5 years and 4 years is definitely new. Usually, the droughts would be 1 or 2 years. But now we are looking at quite possibly a 5-year drought. Steinbeck said this. It is not the exact quote, although I wish I had it. It was like this: In the dry years, they worried about where their water would come from. Then the wet years would come and they forgot about the dry years. That has been the story of California for too many--too many-- decades. Certainly Steinbeck saw that in the early part of the 20th century. We are now in the 21st century and we cannot--we cannot--relive that old adage that Steinbeck wrote about. So we need to build for the future. We need to be able to address this in the immediate as best we can and put in place the water systems. I am going to describe those water systems to you just very briefly. Here in the north we have the great Shasta Reservoir up here on the Upper Sacramento River. It could be raised. It could be increased. There are some environmental and certainly some cost issues associated with raising Shasta. That is one of the proposals of possibilities in our legislation. The other one sits right about in here off stream. The Sacramento River flows down through the middle of the valley here, but off-stream over here in my district actually is a potential reservoir that has been talked about for maybe 50 years now called Sites Reservoir. It stores about 1.8 million acre-feet of water. It could deliver annually 500,000 acre-feet of water. That is a lot of water. That is 1 foot of water across 5,000 acres. Did I say 5,000? It is 500,000 acres. So that is the Sites Reservoir over here. That reservoir also does something really unique. Since it is off- river, it will take the water flowing down the Sacramento River during the heavy storms, put that water into the reservoir, and then, when summer comes or the drought comes, that water can be released back into the Sacramento River, providing water quality issues here in the Delta of California--and I will come to that in just a few moments--creating flexibility on the great reservoirs--Shasta, the Yuba system, the Folsom Reservoir here in Sacramento, and the big California reservoir in Oroville--allowing the operations of those reservoirs to be modified in such a way that they are able to store water rather than releasing it down the river for fish and wildlife. It would then be able to release water from Sites Reservoir and keep that water back in these reservoirs. A major problem in Sacramento is that the Folsom Reservoir is at low tide. I will have tomorrow representatives from the east Sacramento area in my office, all of them saying: Oh, my goodness. We don't have enough water in Folsom Reservoir for our cities of Rancho Cordova, Roseville, and the like, east of Sacramento. So Sites Reservoir could provide more water in the Sacramento region by keeping that water in the Folsom Reservoir. Let's talk a little bit about the delta. I guess I had better finish the other reservoirs. Down here in the Fresno area on the San Joaquin River we have the big Friant Reservoir on the San Joaquin. There is a bit of a problem with Friant. It managed to dry up the San Joaquin River, creating a big, big problem for the salmon. They don't do very well in dry rivers. So there is an effort underway to try to restore some of the salmon on the rivers in the San Joaquin Valley, the Stanislaus, the Merced, and the other rivers as you move down towards the San Joaquin. There would be a new reservoir that is proposed here at Temperance Flat. Is it possible? Yes. Is it environmentally controversial? Oh, yeah. No doubt about that. And it is expensive. But, nonetheless, our legislation would authorize a continuation of the studies to see if it is worth doing. So that would be the Temperance Flat. Over here on the hills to the east of Oakland there is another storage reservoir off-stream, and that one is called Los Vaqueros. Los Vaqueros is a reservoir that is controlled by the Contra Costa Water District. They now have agreements with other water districts in the bay area to increase the size of that reservoir to store more water at that area. Again, that is off-stream. It would take the high winter flows and put that water in storage off-stream as with Sites Reservoir to the north of it, all very, very important. So these are the essential projects that would be long term for California. Again, they would be the surface storage reservoirs, two off-stream and three potentially on-stream. They would be recharging the aquifers and the various infrastructure needed to do that, recycling in the great cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, and in the bay area to recycle water and, also, dealing with the contamination that occurs in many of the cities in the Central Valley, the San Joaquin Valley particularly, a little bit up here in the Sacramento Valley, and a lot of problems in the Salinas Valley in this area. So those are the essential elements of the long term--I forgot conservation and desalination. So those are the long-term projects that are both in proposition 1 of the California water bond of 2014 and, also, in our legislation. The second piece of the legislation deals with the operation of the two great water projects. These are the largest water projects in the world, although China is building one that might actually be bigger. But, as of today, the largest water projects in the world are in California. What they basically do--maybe I will back up here a bit. It would be great if my colleagues here really had a sense of what is happening. The basic water projects of California take the water from the Sacramento Valley, the Sacramento River, Mount Shasta up here, and the Trinity River, bring that water in through the Shasta Reservoir, hold the water there, and then send the water down the Sacramento River to the delta. [[Page H846]] {time} 2030 From the delta, that water is picked up in canals--two of them, one operated by the Federal Government, the other one operated by the State of California--and brings that water--the Federal Government--down into the San Joaquin Valley, where it provides hundreds of thousands of acres of irrigated agricultural production. The other part of that project is here on the San Joaquin. That takes water down the east side of the valley, all the way to Kern County, down here in the Bakersfield area, and north up into the Madera County area here. That is called the Friant-Kern system. That is the Federal water project. The State water project, like the Federal, takes the water out of the delta here and brings it down in the canal, all the way down here, providing water to Kern County, and then pumps that water 2,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains through tunnels and canals into southern California. It flows down through the western part of the Mohave Desert down here, and then flows into the Los Angeles area, and also into the Palm Springs area all the way over here. That is the California water project. Some of that water flowing into the Metropolitan Water District is then available for the cities and water districts of southern California, all the way down to San Diego and into the Coachella Valley over here in the Palm Springs area. It is one huge water project, all of it dependent on the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. There is no other estuary anywhere from Chile to Alaska as large and as important to the aquatic species and birds as the great delta of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system. Unlike many deltas, this is an inland delta. This is the beginning of San Francisco Bay here. It goes on out. The Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco are just further to the west. Once again, the water flows southward down the Sacramento River, past the city of Sacramento, and flows down through the delta, picked up by the great pumps here at Tracy into the canals, and down the canals to the San Joaquin Valley and on to southern California. Here is the problem: the pumping has significantly altered the ecology of the delta and, when coupled with the drought, has created a situation that has led to a very serious potential of the extinction of species in the delta, particularly the delta smelt. Because of the alteration of the Sacramento River system's normal flow, the salmon, which would normally migrate up the Sacramento River all the way to Mount Shasta and beyond or down the San Joaquin River system to Fresno, that migration pattern has been seriously altered. In normal years, the management of the river is such that the salmon are able to get along, not as well as they once did when it was said you could walk across the river on the back of salmon--you can't do that today for sure--but, nonetheless, in a normal year these river systems, excluding the Lower San Joaquin, are able to produce a significant salmon run. In the delta, the delta smelt have been under great pressure since the pumps were put in. The smelt is a little, tiny fish, but it happens to be like the foundation fish--all the bigger fish eat it. And it is also what we call the canary in the coal mine. If you remember what that is all about, you use canaries in a coal mine. When the canary keels over, you have got a serious problem because you are the next to keel over--bad air. Well, here these delta smelt are considered to be the canary in the water. When they are in deep trouble--and they are today--the question arises: Is the entire ecosystem of the delta going to collapse? We think not. But California is severely stressed. California is still in drought. Today, the rainfall in California is 75 percent of normal. That is for the entire State. For the Sacramento region, February is 22 percent of normal, and I think we are rapidly approaching the end of February. What that means for the delta is extraordinary stress--extraordinary stress--and a monumental California water fight. My great-grandfather came to California in the 1860s to mine for gold. During that time, there was a fellow out there by the name of Mark Twain, who was writing about the gold rush and other things that were going on in California. He said a couple of things that are really interesting. About San Francisco, he said that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in San Francisco. I think he was referring to the fog. He also said that in California in the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, he said: ``Whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over.'' So it has been. During the Gold Rush period, it was all about water. You couldn't mine for gold unless you had water, and people fought over water. They built incredible systems to get their hands on the water that came out of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Today, it is the same. We still fight about water. What Senator Feinstein and I are trying to do is to reduce the friction, reduce the fighting that has been going on for the last decade, or last 5 years, about water as it flows through the delta. My San Joaquin Valley colleagues, Democrat and Republican, have put forth two pieces of legislation that they believe would solve the water problem for them. What they have managed to do with that legislation is to basically wipe out the environmental protection for the species-- salmon, smelt, and other species in the delta--and simply say: Turn the pumps on. We need the water. We have got the votes. We are going to get the water. Those two pieces of legislation have not become law, and they never should become law, because if they did, the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere would be in serious jeopardy. What we propose is to work within the environmental laws and the biological opinions that have been put forth by the Federal and State fish and wildlife agencies and the National Marine Fisheries Service-- the National Marine Fisheries Service concerned about the salmon; the fish and wildlife agencies concerned about the endemic species of the delta--to work within those biological opinions which are designed to protect those species and say the flexibility that is allowed under the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the biological opinions are sufficient to allow for the maximum amount of pumping to the south from the delta consistent with the protection of the species. In order to accomplish that, we need to use science. The biological opinions are based on about 13- to 15-year-old science. What we are saying in our legislation is ramp up the science. Senator Feinstein was able to deliver $100 million to California fish agencies to put in place realtime monitoring. She was not able to write how that could occur, so in the legislation we would direct the agencies to conduct real-time monitoring, daily monitoring. As the winter flows--and there have been winter flows thus far this year, not enough, but they are there. As those winter flows enter the delta from the north and the south, the fish agencies study where are the smelt, where are the salmon coming down the Sacramento River, and also from the San Joaquin River. If they are near the delta pumps, reduce the pumping, or don't pump at all, depending where those fish are. If they are not, if they have moved away from the pumps and there is water in the system, then turn the pumps on. Pretty simple: if the fish are endangered, reduce the pumping; if the fish are not endangered, then increase the pumping. That is essentially what our legislation would accomplish. There are other elements to it, for example, putting in fish screens at the Delta Cross Channel on the Georgiana Slough, and also to improve the levee system within the delta. We will see. We will see what happens here. We have a choice as Members of Congress and men and women that are supposed to solve problems. We can go the way of my San Joaquin Valley colleagues and simply push aside, negate, the environmental laws that provide for the protection of the salmon, the great fishing industry of California, the salmon runs up and down the coast. By the way, the salmon that come out of the Sacramento River provide salmon all the way to the Columbia River in Oregon. So it is not just about San Francisco Bay. It is about the salmon and the fishing industry for much of the West Coast, also south through Monterey Bay. [[Page H847]] Can we wipe out the environmental laws and simply turn the pumps on? Yes, if that legislation were to pass that has been offered by my colleagues from the San Joaquin Valley. Or we can work within the environmental laws, achieving maximum flexibility, understanding the science: Where are the salmon or the salmonoids? Those are the salmon that have hatched and are coming back down the river, little, tiny salmon. Where are they? Are they coming down the river and getting sucked to the pumps, or are they coming down the river and heading out to the bay? We don't know today. We are not doing real-time monitoring. If we did real-time monitoring, we would know where they are. We would know where the delta smelt are and other species, and we could adjust the pumping to protect the species and to take advantage of the high flows that occur during the normal winters and also this year, even though it is well below normal. I have confidence. I have confidence in the wisdom of the Californians who decided that they would pass a water bond to put in place long-range solutions for California--recycling, conservation, storage systems, underground aquifers--and to develop safe drinking water. I have confidence in the wisdom of California because they voted by over 60 percent for this project. I have confidence in the Congress. I have confidence in the Senate. Senator Feinstein has come up with a good bill. I had the honor to work with her on that bill, and I will soon introduce that bill here in the House. I have confidence that we have the wisdom and we have the understanding of the systems of California water to maximize over time the water potential of California. And in the near term, in the near term when California, this great State that we would like to see as green, when California is faced with this, I have got confidence that we are wise enough and we are smart enough politically to maneuver ourselves into a situation where we can address the current drought to the maximum extent possible, delivering water to the San Joaquin Valley and on into southern California without harming the fish, without destroying the salmon of California and the fishing, the multibillion- dollar fishing industry that goes with it, and without jeopardizing the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. That is our challenge. This is what we are going to try to accomplish. Senator Feinstein's bill has been introduced. That version will be introduced over here in the next several days as we develop a better understanding among my colleagues of what we are trying to accomplish here. {time} 2045 I have confidence that the representatives of the southern California area will see the wisdom of putting aside what Mark Twain said we always do in California: Fighting over water and getting about drinking more whiskey. Probably a pretty good idea. I think we are going to get southern California support for this. I think the San Joaquin Valley folks will look at this and say: Well, we can continue fighting as we have for the last 5 years with no progress, none, nada, zero. Let's see if we can figure out how to do this in a way that protects the species, the salmon, the other fish, that protects the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere, and that provides the maximum amount of water that is available to California, which, by the way, has an economy that is ranked seventh in the world. So water is really important. I know we can do better. I know that this Nation doesn't have to have this kind of water in Flint, Michigan. I know that this Nation doesn't have to have children in the Central Valley of California getting their water out of a cattle water trough. I know that this Nation doesn't have to destroy the largest estuary and all of the fish, all of the salmon, and all of the industry that goes with that in its quest for water and that what little is available can be shared and maximized. That is what we are going to try to do with the Feinstein-Garamendi legislation. I know we can do it. I know we have to do it. I know, at the end of the day, we are not going to destroy. We are going to build, we are going to create, and we are going to solve the problem. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H843-H847] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WATER QUALITY AND SUPPLY ISSUES IN THE UNITED STATES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the earlier discussion about one of America's most longstanding and most noted Justices. His passing is mourned by all of us. I do, however, today want to move to a different subject. I want to talk about, I think, one of the two most essential things that a human being needs to live. That is water and air. But today we are going to take the former of those two subjects and really talk about water. Two weeks ago I put this up for all to see. This is tap water from Flint, Michigan. There has been a lot of discussion over the last month, month and a half, almost 3 months now, about Flint, Michigan, about the water supply in Flint, Michigan, lead in the pipes, lead pipes, about the public health emergency that exists there, and about what we could and should do about dealing with Flint, Michigan. However, Flint, Michigan is not unique. This is how they get water in East Porterville. In the Central Valley of California, the San Joaquin Valley, just south of Fresno, California, the water supplies in the East Porterville area ran dry, in part, because of the drought, in part, because of inadequate water systems. So the residents of East Porterville were required to get water from a cattle water trough, pretty much like I have on my ranch, although, hopefully, this water is a whole lot cleaner. Porterville, California. Now we have two examples, one from the Midwest, another one from the Far West. Any other problems about water supply? Well, yes. There are other problems about water supply. This is a list of problems that we know exist in the United States-- or most recently existed: Flint, Michigan, we just saw that picture. Toledo, Ohio, you remember, had to shut down the water system because of problems from algae blooms. Sebring, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; Brick Township, New Jersey; Washington, D.C., lead release. Wayne County, North Carolina; Greenville, North Carolina; Lakehurst Acres, Maine; Chicago, Illinois. I decided not to put them all up there because it would take the rest of the evening to list all the communities in America that have water issues. And certainly we do in California. I could put up another--well, maybe I will. Let me just put up a map of California. This is the largest population in the United States, approaching 40 million people. And far north, the Pacific Coast, San Francisco Bay, Los Angeles, down here, Santa Barbara, and way down here, San Diego, and somewhere over here, Arizona and Nevada, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the coastal range, and the great Central Valley of California, where a whole lot of America's food and food exports come from. Down here in the Tulare Lake Basin, there are well over 100 communities who have contaminated water from nitrates and other harmful substances. So the issue of clean water, you know, shortage of water down here, and contaminated wells up and down--oh. The Salinas Valley. Monterey Bay and the great Salinas Valley, many, many of the wells in that area are also contaminated. So we have got a water quality problem really throughout the United States, and we certainly have one in California. We have another problem in California. Let me put this up, a little different map. The previous map, that one, nice and green. That is not California today. We may be and probably are in the fifth year of the great California drought. This is a picture of the California drought situation. The yellow is a little less than normal. The red, far less than normal. This brown is really the way California will be as soon as this summer comes on. And that is called exceptional drought. So the great Central Valley of California, the coastal range down into Los Angeles, even over to the east side of the Sierras, an exceptional drought. So the green California is really not so green. Today we are about halfway through the rainy season in California, and the [[Page H844]] current rain for the entire State is about 75 percent of normal. That is why you see this extreme drought occurring even as of February 18, 2016. The Sierra snowpack is less than normal but is still a whole lot better than last year, when it was zero, as in no snow. So what are we going to do? Well, we need to do something. Otherwise, we are going to have a whole lot more pain in California. So what Senator Feinstein and I have been doing over the last several months is trying to develop a solution for the immediate drought, to make the most of the water that is available, while still protecting the endangered species, the great salmon runs of the Central Valley of California, and the coastal rivers, as well as the species that live in the delta of California. So we have been working, trying to put together a piece of legislation that would provide as much flexibility as possible, while still protecting the fish species and the flora and fauna of the State. We think we have done it. We think we do have a piece of legislation that will do that. We call that the operational portion of the legislation. Senator Feinstein has already introduced that legislation. I intend to do so in the very near future here in the House of Representatives so that we can have a statement from the House of Representatives about how we can solve the drought problem--well, not solve it--do the very best we can in an extreme circumstance to deliver as much water as possible to the farms and the cities of all of California, while also protecting the endangered species. Let me just put this up. This is the essence of the legislation. I am going to start here at the bottom and work towards the top. This is the short-term provision of the bill. I will go into this in more detail in a few moments. The bill also has what we call long-term infrastructure needs. Those long-term infrastructure needs are storage reservoirs, aquifers beneath the surface of the earth, where we have groundwater--or we used to have groundwater, surface storage. There are several new and expanded reservoir opportunities available in the State, some of them on the streams and rivers--and, of course, those will be controversial--and one or two that are off-stream, in the valleys and the mountains where there are no active rivers, those being somewhat less controversial. So there is surface storage. There is underground aquifer storage. That is this one right here. Authorized $600 million for water storage projects, both aquifer as well as surface storage. We also have this thing called conservation. Conservation is where you can get the most water. For every gallon of water that you conserve, that is a gallon of water that would be available for other purposes or to extend what little you have available. So conservation plays a major role. In this legislation, there is money for conservation. There is also money for this recycling. Now, much of the Midwest recycles water. In fact, the entire Mississippi River system is recycled water, water that is used upstream by some city, cleaned, put back in the river, reused again as it flows down the Mississippi River and its tributaries. California doesn't do much recycling. I don't have a map here of the--no, I don't. But if one were to take a look at the whole Pacific Coast of California and the United States and Alaska and Central America and South America--so from Alaska all the way south to Chile on the West Coast, the Pacific Coast, of the Western Hemisphere--you would find that the fifth biggest river in all of that vast stretch--the great rivers of Alaska and Canada, the Columbia River, the Sacramento River, the Colorado River down here, and the rivers of Central and South America--the fifth biggest happens to be right here, here, here, and here. {time} 2015 The fifth biggest rivers are the sanitation plants of California that take water from up and down the entire area and from the Colorado all the way from the Rockies, use it, clean it to a higher standard than the day it arrives in the great cities of California, clean it to a higher standard, and then they dump it in the ocean. This is utter foolishness. So in the Garamendi-Feinstein legislation, we have $200 million for water recycling so that we can recycle that water, reuse it, and make use of water that is already available. We know, for example, that in Los Angeles there are approximately 1 million acre-feet of water that is not now being used. In fact, it is being dumped into the ocean. With this recycling program, 1 million acre-feet of new water can be available in southern California. And, by the way, for those of you who are not familiar with California, we are talking about the Los Angeles basin here. So the recycling in this basin can deliver 1 million acre-feet of water over the next decade or so, and that water can be put back into the great aquifers of southern California and even down into the San Diego area. These aquifers are now largely contaminated with various contaminants, but they can be cleaned and the water recycled, put back in the aquifers, taken out, cleaned, and round and round it goes. One million acre-feet: What does that mean to northern California, to Colorado, our friends in Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada? It means that that is a million acre-feet that Los Angeles, the great basin down here, does not need to take from the Sacramento River in northern California or from the Colorado River, taking pressure off those rivers. And as you saw from the drought map, those rivers are in severe trouble. So that is kind of a strategy that we put in place. Now, we are not geniuses--well, maybe--no. We are not geniuses. But what we do know is that the State of California has already figured this out. So what our legislation does is to tie directly to, mirror, augment, and push forward what California did in the 2014 election, which is to pass proposition 1, an almost $7 billion proposition for the development of water supplies for California. So, look at this: Water conservation, storm water recapturing, increase local and regional supplies, $810 million. Our legislation would fit right in there with conservation and these other programs. Safe drinking water. Remember talking about Porterville and water troughs for cattle from which the kids were taking water? Here you have the Safe Drinking Water Program. And guess what. It is in the Feinstein-Garamendi legislation. Yes. There it is, money to help small communities through the Bureau of Reclamation expanding their WaterSMART and other programs so that we can mirror, augment, supplement, and advance what California already wants to do when proposition 1 goes into effect. Let's see. Water recycling. Didn't I just talk about that? Yes, I did. So in the legislation that Senator Feinstein has already introduced and what I will soon introduce here, we will be once again working with the water recycling. Not as much money, but still a major Federal effort to work with the State to maximize the water recycling. This is also not on this list, but also desalinization, which happens to work for some parts of California as well as other parts of the United States. I talked about groundwater. Yes. Our legislation mirrors the groundwater program that is in proposition 1, adds some additional money, and directs the Federal Government to work directly with the State on advancing the groundwater issues. Now, for those of you that have been following the drought in California over the last several years--actually, the last several decades--California has been excessively using its groundwater so much so that, in parts of the great Central Valley of California--maybe I will put that map back up here--in the great Central Valley of California, particularly in this part of the Central Valley and the Fresno area and south, we have seen a significant fall in the surface of the Earth. It is literally sinking as a result of the groundwater being pumped out. In many places, you can go down through this area and you will see wells that are way, way above the ground and the ground is down here maybe 10, 20 feet. You have seen subsidence in the area. So the over-drafting in this area and some in the Sacramento Valley as well as in the Salinas Valley is a serious problem. Part of what we want to do, mirroring what the State has already decided to do with proposition 1, is to [[Page H845]] have the Federal Government work with the State on addressing the aquifers in this region to find ways to recharge the aquifers. There are many different ways that that can be done. Some of it is simply pumping the water back into the ground rather than pumping it out. In other areas, the geology in various parts, particularly along the coastal mountains as well as along the Sierra Nevada mountains, there are gravel channels, old river channels that have historically recharged the groundwater basins in parts--actually, along most of the Central Valley. So it has to be done. This is what we are trying to do with this legislation: Desalination research, which I discussed earlier, $100 million; water storage, $600 million; water recycling, $200 million; and $55 million for specific protections for the fish and wildlife species. There is a whole series of projects that would fit into that. Once again, all of this infrastructure work is designed to coordinate specifically with what the State of California is doing with their multibillion-dollar proposition 1. This isn't in effect yet, but this money is now working its way through the various environmental studies and various levels of government so that very soon these projects will be underway. If we are able to pass the legislation that we want to introduce, we are going to see the Federal Government working very, very closely with the State government in addressing the California problem. Now, who cares about California? If you care about food, your fresh veggies, you had better care about California. Over here in the Salinas Valley where lettuce comes from? Drought problems. In the Central Valley, let's see. You name the crop, everything from rice to walnuts--oh, wine grapes are very, very important if you like your wine. In the central coast down here, the same thing. So what we are trying to do with the legislation is to provide a long-term fix to California so that we can increase the supply of water, increase the storage during the wet years, put the storage in reservoirs and in the aquifers so that, when the dry years come, then we will do it. There was a fellow by the name of Steinbeck. He wrote a book, ``East of Eden.'' In that book, he talked about the California droughts. This is not a new situation, although 5 years and 4 years is definitely new. Usually, the droughts would be 1 or 2 years. But now we are looking at quite possibly a 5-year drought. Steinbeck said this. It is not the exact quote, although I wish I had it. It was like this: In the dry years, they worried about where their water would come from. Then the wet years would come and they forgot about the dry years. That has been the story of California for too many--too many-- decades. Certainly Steinbeck saw that in the early part of the 20th century. We are now in the 21st century and we cannot--we cannot--relive that old adage that Steinbeck wrote about. So we need to build for the future. We need to be able to address this in the immediate as best we can and put in place the water systems. I am going to describe those water systems to you just very briefly. Here in the north we have the great Shasta Reservoir up here on the Upper Sacramento River. It could be raised. It could be increased. There are some environmental and certainly some cost issues associated with raising Shasta. That is one of the proposals of possibilities in our legislation. The other one sits right about in here off stream. The Sacramento River flows down through the middle of the valley here, but off-stream over here in my district actually is a potential reservoir that has been talked about for maybe 50 years now called Sites Reservoir. It stores about 1.8 million acre-feet of water. It could deliver annually 500,000 acre-feet of water. That is a lot of water. That is 1 foot of water across 5,000 acres. Did I say 5,000? It is 500,000 acres. So that is the Sites Reservoir over here. That reservoir also does something really unique. Since it is off- river, it will take the water flowing down the Sacramento River during the heavy storms, put that water into the reservoir, and then, when summer comes or the drought comes, that water can be released back into the Sacramento River, providing water quality issues here in the Delta of California--and I will come to that in just a few moments--creating flexibility on the great reservoirs--Shasta, the Yuba system, the Folsom Reservoir here in Sacramento, and the big California reservoir in Oroville--allowing the operations of those reservoirs to be modified in such a way that they are able to store water rather than releasing it down the river for fish and wildlife. It would then be able to release water from Sites Reservoir and keep that water back in these reservoirs. A major problem in Sacramento is that the Folsom Reservoir is at low tide. I will have tomorrow representatives from the east Sacramento area in my office, all of them saying: Oh, my goodness. We don't have enough water in Folsom Reservoir for our cities of Rancho Cordova, Roseville, and the like, east of Sacramento. So Sites Reservoir could provide more water in the Sacramento region by keeping that water in the Folsom Reservoir. Let's talk a little bit about the delta. I guess I had better finish the other reservoirs. Down here in the Fresno area on the San Joaquin River we have the big Friant Reservoir on the San Joaquin. There is a bit of a problem with Friant. It managed to dry up the San Joaquin River, creating a big, big problem for the salmon. They don't do very well in dry rivers. So there is an effort underway to try to restore some of the salmon on the rivers in the San Joaquin Valley, the Stanislaus, the Merced, and the other rivers as you move down towards the San Joaquin. There would be a new reservoir that is proposed here at Temperance Flat. Is it possible? Yes. Is it environmentally controversial? Oh, yeah. No doubt about that. And it is expensive. But, nonetheless, our legislation would authorize a continuation of the studies to see if it is worth doing. So that would be the Temperance Flat. Over here on the hills to the east of Oakland there is another storage reservoir off-stream, and that one is called Los Vaqueros. Los Vaqueros is a reservoir that is controlled by the Contra Costa Water District. They now have agreements with other water districts in the bay area to increase the size of that reservoir to store more water at that area. Again, that is off-stream. It would take the high winter flows and put that water in storage off-stream as with Sites Reservoir to the north of it, all very, very important. So these are the essential projects that would be long term for California. Again, they would be the surface storage reservoirs, two off-stream and three potentially on-stream. They would be recharging the aquifers and the various infrastructure needed to do that, recycling in the great cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, and in the bay area to recycle water and, also, dealing with the contamination that occurs in many of the cities in the Central Valley, the San Joaquin Valley particularly, a little bit up here in the Sacramento Valley, and a lot of problems in the Salinas Valley in this area. So those are the essential elements of the long term--I forgot conservation and desalination. So those are the long-term projects that are both in proposition 1 of the California water bond of 2014 and, also, in our legislation. The second piece of the legislation deals with the operation of the two great water projects. These are the largest water projects in the world, although China is building one that might actually be bigger. But, as of today, the largest water projects in the world are in California. What they basically do--maybe I will back up here a bit. It would be great if my colleagues here really had a sense of what is happening. The basic water projects of California take the water from the Sacramento Valley, the Sacramento River, Mount Shasta up here, and the Trinity River, bring that water in through the Shasta Reservoir, hold the water there, and then send the water down the Sacramento River to the delta. [[Page H846]] {time} 2030 From the delta, that water is picked up in canals--two of them, one operated by the Federal Government, the other one operated by the State of California--and brings that water--the Federal Government--down into the San Joaquin Valley, where it provides hundreds of thousands of acres of irrigated agricultural production. The other part of that project is here on the San Joaquin. That takes water down the east side of the valley, all the way to Kern County, down here in the Bakersfield area, and north up into the Madera County area here. That is called the Friant-Kern system. That is the Federal water project. The State water project, like the Federal, takes the water out of the delta here and brings it down in the canal, all the way down here, providing water to Kern County, and then pumps that water 2,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains through tunnels and canals into southern California. It flows down through the western part of the Mohave Desert down here, and then flows into the Los Angeles area, and also into the Palm Springs area all the way over here. That is the California water project. Some of that water flowing into the Metropolitan Water District is then available for the cities and water districts of southern California, all the way down to San Diego and into the Coachella Valley over here in the Palm Springs area. It is one huge water project, all of it dependent on the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. There is no other estuary anywhere from Chile to Alaska as large and as important to the aquatic species and birds as the great delta of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system. Unlike many deltas, this is an inland delta. This is the beginning of San Francisco Bay here. It goes on out. The Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco are just further to the west. Once again, the water flows southward down the Sacramento River, past the city of Sacramento, and flows down through the delta, picked up by the great pumps here at Tracy into the canals, and down the canals to the San Joaquin Valley and on to southern California. Here is the problem: the pumping has significantly altered the ecology of the delta and, when coupled with the drought, has created a situation that has led to a very serious potential of the extinction of species in the delta, particularly the delta smelt. Because of the alteration of the Sacramento River system's normal flow, the salmon, which would normally migrate up the Sacramento River all the way to Mount Shasta and beyond or down the San Joaquin River system to Fresno, that migration pattern has been seriously altered. In normal years, the management of the river is such that the salmon are able to get along, not as well as they once did when it was said you could walk across the river on the back of salmon--you can't do that today for sure--but, nonetheless, in a normal year these river systems, excluding the Lower San Joaquin, are able to produce a significant salmon run. In the delta, the delta smelt have been under great pressure since the pumps were put in. The smelt is a little, tiny fish, but it happens to be like the foundation fish--all the bigger fish eat it. And it is also what we call the canary in the coal mine. If you remember what that is all about, you use canaries in a coal mine. When the canary keels over, you have got a serious problem because you are the next to keel over--bad air. Well, here these delta smelt are considered to be the canary in the water. When they are in deep trouble--and they are today--the question arises: Is the entire ecosystem of the delta going to collapse? We think not. But California is severely stressed. California is still in drought. Today, the rainfall in California is 75 percent of normal. That is for the entire State. For the Sacramento region, February is 22 percent of normal, and I think we are rapidly approaching the end of February. What that means for the delta is extraordinary stress--extraordinary stress--and a monumental California water fight. My great-grandfather came to California in the 1860s to mine for gold. During that time, there was a fellow out there by the name of Mark Twain, who was writing about the gold rush and other things that were going on in California. He said a couple of things that are really interesting. About San Francisco, he said that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in San Francisco. I think he was referring to the fog. He also said that in California in the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, he said: ``Whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over.'' So it has been. During the Gold Rush period, it was all about water. You couldn't mine for gold unless you had water, and people fought over water. They built incredible systems to get their hands on the water that came out of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Today, it is the same. We still fight about water. What Senator Feinstein and I are trying to do is to reduce the friction, reduce the fighting that has been going on for the last decade, or last 5 years, about water as it flows through the delta. My San Joaquin Valley colleagues, Democrat and Republican, have put forth two pieces of legislation that they believe would solve the water problem for them. What they have managed to do with that legislation is to basically wipe out the environmental protection for the species-- salmon, smelt, and other species in the delta--and simply say: Turn the pumps on. We need the water. We have got the votes. We are going to get the water. Those two pieces of legislation have not become law, and they never should become law, because if they did, the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere would be in serious jeopardy. What we propose is to work within the environmental laws and the biological opinions that have been put forth by the Federal and State fish and wildlife agencies and the National Marine Fisheries Service-- the National Marine Fisheries Service concerned about the salmon; the fish and wildlife agencies concerned about the endemic species of the delta--to work within those biological opinions which are designed to protect those species and say the flexibility that is allowed under the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the biological opinions are sufficient to allow for the maximum amount of pumping to the south from the delta consistent with the protection of the species. In order to accomplish that, we need to use science. The biological opinions are based on about 13- to 15-year-old science. What we are saying in our legislation is ramp up the science. Senator Feinstein was able to deliver $100 million to California fish agencies to put in place realtime monitoring. She was not able to write how that could occur, so in the legislation we would direct the agencies to conduct real-time monitoring, daily monitoring. As the winter flows--and there have been winter flows thus far this year, not enough, but they are there. As those winter flows enter the delta from the north and the south, the fish agencies study where are the smelt, where are the salmon coming down the Sacramento River, and also from the San Joaquin River. If they are near the delta pumps, reduce the pumping, or don't pump at all, depending where those fish are. If they are not, if they have moved away from the pumps and there is water in the system, then turn the pumps on. Pretty simple: if the fish are endangered, reduce the pumping; if the fish are not endangered, then increase the pumping. That is essentially what our legislation would accomplish. There are other elements to it, for example, putting in fish screens at the Delta Cross Channel on the Georgiana Slough, and also to improve the levee system within the delta. We will see. We will see what happens here. We have a choice as Members of Congress and men and women that are supposed to solve problems. We can go the way of my San Joaquin Valley colleagues and simply push aside, negate, the environmental laws that provide for the protection of the salmon, the great fishing industry of California, the salmon runs up and down the coast. By the way, the salmon that come out of the Sacramento River provide salmon all the way to the Columbia River in Oregon. So it is not just about San Francisco Bay. It is about the salmon and the fishing industry for much of the West Coast, also south through Monterey Bay. [[Page H847]] Can we wipe out the environmental laws and simply turn the pumps on? Yes, if that legislation were to pass that has been offered by my colleagues from the San Joaquin Valley. Or we can work within the environmental laws, achieving maximum flexibility, understanding the science: Where are the salmon or the salmonoids? Those are the salmon that have hatched and are coming back down the river, little, tiny salmon. Where are they? Are they coming down the river and getting sucked to the pumps, or are they coming down the river and heading out to the bay? We don't know today. We are not doing real-time monitoring. If we did real-time monitoring, we would know where they are. We would know where the delta smelt are and other species, and we could adjust the pumping to protect the species and to take advantage of the high flows that occur during the normal winters and also this year, even though it is well below normal. I have confidence. I have confidence in the wisdom of the Californians who decided that they would pass a water bond to put in place long-range solutions for California--recycling, conservation, storage systems, underground aquifers--and to develop safe drinking water. I have confidence in the wisdom of California because they voted by over 60 percent for this project. I have confidence in the Congress. I have confidence in the Senate. Senator Feinstein has come up with a good bill. I had the honor to work with her on that bill, and I will soon introduce that bill here in the House. I have confidence that we have the wisdom and we have the understanding of the systems of California water to maximize over time the water potential of California. And in the near term, in the near term when California, this great State that we would like to see as green, when California is faced with this, I have got confidence that we are wise enough and we are smart enough politically to maneuver ourselves into a situation where we can address the current drought to the maximum extent possible, delivering water to the San Joaquin Valley and on into southern California without harming the fish, without destroying the salmon of California and the fishing, the multibillion- dollar fishing industry that goes with it, and without jeopardizing the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. That is our challenge. This is what we are going to try to accomplish. Senator Feinstein's bill has been introduced. That version will be introduced over here in the next several days as we develop a better understanding among my colleagues of what we are trying to accomplish here. {time} 2045 I have confidence that the representatives of the southern California area will see the wisdom of putting aside what Mark Twain said we always do in California: Fighting over water and getting about drinking more whiskey. Probably a pretty good idea. I think we are going to get southern California support for this. I think the San Joaquin Valley folks will look at this and say: Well, we can continue fighting as we have for the last 5 years with no progress, none, nada, zero. Let's see if we can figure out how to do this in a way that protects the species, the salmon, the other fish, that protects the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere, and that provides the maximum amount of water that is available to California, which, by the way, has an economy that is ranked seventh in the world. So water is really important. I know we can do better. I know that this Nation doesn't have to have this kind of water in Flint, Michigan. I know that this Nation doesn't have to have children in the Central Valley of California getting their water out of a cattle water trough. I know that this Nation doesn't have to destroy the largest estuary and all of the fish, all of the salmon, and all of the industry that goes with that in its quest for water and that what little is available can be shared and maximized. That is what we are going to try to do with the Feinstein-Garamendi legislation. I know we can do it. I know we have to do it. I know, at the end of the day, we are not going to destroy. We are going to build, we are going to create, and we are going to solve the problem. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,33773,33773,33844,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [house] [pages h843-h847] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] water quality and supply issues in the united states the speaker pro tempore (mr. loudermilk). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from california (mr. garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, i appreciate the earlier discussion about one of america's most longstanding and most noted justices. his passing is mourned by all of us. i do, however, today want to move to a different subject. i want to talk about, i think, one of the two most essential things that a human being needs to live. that is water and air. but today we are going to take the former of those two subjects and really talk about water. two weeks ago i put this up for all to see. this is tap water from flint, michigan. there has been a lot of discussion over the last month, month and a half, almost 3 months now, about flint, michigan, about the water supply in flint, michigan, lead in the pipes, lead pipes, about the public health emergency that exists there, and about what we could and should do about dealing with flint, michigan. however, flint, michigan is not unique. this is how they get water in east porterville. in the central valley of california, the san joaquin valley, just south of fresno, california, the water supplies in the east porterville area ran dry, in part, because of the drought, in part, because of inadequate water systems. so the residents of east porterville were required to get water from a cattle water trough, pretty much like i have on my ranch, although, hopefully, this water is a whole lot cleaner. porterville, california. now we have two examples, one from the midwest, another one from the far west. any other problems about water supply? well, yes. there are other problems about water supply. this is a list of problems that we know exist in the united states-- or most recently existed: flint, michigan, we just saw that picture. toledo, ohio, you remember, had to shut down the water system because of problems from algae blooms. sebring, ohio; baltimore, maryland; brick township, new jersey; washington, d.c., lead release. wayne county, north carolina; greenville, north carolina; lakehurst acres, maine; chicago, illinois. i decided not to put them all up there because it would take the rest of the evening to list all the communities in america that have water issues. and certainly we do in california. i could put up another--well, maybe i will. let me just put up a map of california. this is the largest population in the united states, approaching 40 million people. and far north, the pacific coast, san francisco bay, los angeles, down here, santa barbara, and way down here, san diego, and somewhere over here, arizona and nevada, the sierra nevada mountains, the coastal range, and the great central valley of california, where a whole lot of america's food and food exports come from. down here in the tulare lake basin, there are well over 100 communities who have contaminated water from nitrates and other harmful substances. so the issue of clean water, you know, shortage of water down here, and contaminated wells up and down--oh. the salinas valley. monterey bay and the great salinas valley, many, many of the wells in that area are also contaminated. so we have got a water quality problem really throughout the united states, and we certainly have one in california. we have another problem in california. let me put this up, a little different map. the previous map, that one, nice and green. that is not california today. we may be and probably are in the fifth year of the great california drought. this is a picture of the california drought situation. the yellow is a little less than normal. the red, far less than normal. this brown is really the way california will be as soon as this summer comes on. and that is called exceptional drought. so the great central valley of california, the coastal range down into los angeles, even over to the east side of the sierras, an exceptional drought. so the green california is really not so green. today we are about halfway through the rainy season in california, and the [[page h844]] current rain for the entire state is about 75 percent of normal. that is why you see this extreme drought occurring even as of february 18, 2016. the sierra snowpack is less than normal but is still a whole lot better than last year, when it was zero, as in no snow. so what are we going to do? well, we need to do something. otherwise, we are going to have a whole lot more pain in california. so what senator feinstein and i have been doing over the last several months is trying to develop a solution for the immediate drought, to make the most of the water that is available, while still protecting the endangered species, the great salmon runs of the central valley of california, and the coastal rivers, as well as the species that live in the delta of california. so we have been working, trying to put together a piece of legislation that would provide as much flexibility as possible, while still protecting the fish species and the flora and fauna of the state. we think we have done it. we think we do have a piece of legislation that will do that. we call that the operational portion of the legislation. senator feinstein has already introduced that legislation. i intend to do so in the very near future here in the house of representatives so that we can have a statement from the house of representatives about how we can solve the drought problem--well, not solve it--do the very best we can in an extreme circumstance to deliver as much water as possible to the farms and the cities of all of california, while also protecting the endangered species. let me just put this up. this is the essence of the legislation. i am going to start here at the bottom and work towards the top. this is the short-term provision of the bill. i will go into this in more detail in a few moments. the bill also has what we call long-term infrastructure needs. those long-term infrastructure needs are storage reservoirs, aquifers beneath the surface of the earth, where we have groundwater--or we used to have groundwater, surface storage. there are several new and expanded reservoir opportunities available in the state, some of them on the streams and rivers--and, of course, those will be controversial--and one or two that are off-stream, in the valleys and the mountains where there are no active rivers, those being somewhat less controversial. so there is surface storage. there is underground aquifer storage. that is this one right here. authorized $600 million for water storage projects, both aquifer as well as surface storage. we also have this thing called conservation. conservation is where you can get the most water. for every gallon of water that you conserve, that is a gallon of water that would be available for other purposes or to extend what little you have available. so conservation plays a major role. in this legislation, there is money for conservation. there is also money for this recycling. now, much of the midwest recycles water. in fact, the entire mississippi river system is recycled water, water that is used upstream by some city, cleaned, put back in the river, reused again as it flows down the mississippi river and its tributaries. california doesn't do much recycling. i don't have a map here of the--no, i don't. but if one were to take a look at the whole pacific coast of california and the united states and alaska and central america and south america--so from alaska all the way south to chile on the west coast, the pacific coast, of the western hemisphere--you would find that the fifth biggest river in all of that vast stretch--the great rivers of alaska and canada, the columbia river, the sacramento river, the colorado river down here, and the rivers of central and south america--the fifth biggest happens to be right here, here, here, and here. {time} 2015 the fifth biggest rivers are the sanitation plants of california that take water from up and down the entire area and from the colorado all the way from the rockies, use it, clean it to a higher standard than the day it arrives in the great cities of california, clean it to a higher standard, and then they dump it in the ocean. this is utter foolishness. so in the garamendi-feinstein legislation, we have $200 million for water recycling so that we can recycle that water, reuse it, and make use of water that is already available. we know, for example, that in los angeles there are approximately 1 million acre-feet of water that is not now being used. in fact, it is being dumped into the ocean. with this recycling program, 1 million acre-feet of new water can be available in southern california. and, by the way, for those of you who are not familiar with california, we are talking about the los angeles basin here. so the recycling in this basin can deliver 1 million acre-feet of water over the next decade or so, and that water can be put back into the great aquifers of southern california and even down into the san diego area. these aquifers are now largely contaminated with various contaminants, but they can be cleaned and the water recycled, put back in the aquifers, taken out, cleaned, and round and round it goes. one million acre-feet: what does that mean to northern california, to colorado, our friends in arizona, new mexico, and nevada? it means that that is a million acre-feet that los angeles, the great basin down here, does not need to take from the sacramento river in northern california or from the colorado river, taking pressure off those rivers. and as you saw from the drought map, those rivers are in severe trouble. so that is kind of a strategy that we put in place. now, we are not geniuses--well, maybe--no. we are not geniuses. but what we do know is that the state of california has already figured this out. so what our legislation does is to tie directly to, mirror, augment, and push forward what california did in the 2014 election, which is to pass proposition 1, an almost $7 billion proposition for the development of water supplies for california. so, look at this: water conservation, storm water recapturing, increase local and regional supplies, $810 million. our legislation would fit right in there with conservation and these other programs. safe drinking water. remember talking about porterville and water troughs for cattle from which the kids were taking water? here you have the safe drinking water program. and guess what. it is in the feinstein-garamendi legislation. yes. there it is, money to help small communities through the bureau of reclamation expanding their watersmart and other programs so that we can mirror, augment, supplement, and advance what california already wants to do when proposition 1 goes into effect. let's see. water recycling. didn't i just talk about that? yes, i did. so in the legislation that senator feinstein has already introduced and what i will soon introduce here, we will be once again working with the water recycling. not as much money, but still a major federal effort to work with the state to maximize the water recycling. this is also not on this list, but also desalinization, which happens to work for some parts of california as well as other parts of the united states. i talked about groundwater. yes. our legislation mirrors the groundwater program that is in proposition 1, adds some additional money, and directs the federal government to work directly with the state on advancing the groundwater issues. now, for those of you that have been following the drought in california over the last several years--actually, the last several decades--california has been excessively using its groundwater so much so that, in parts of the great central valley of california--maybe i will put that map back up here--in the great central valley of california, particularly in this part of the central valley and the fresno area and south, we have seen a significant fall in the surface of the earth. it is literally sinking as a result of the groundwater being pumped out. in many places, you can go down through this area and you will see wells that are way, way above the ground and the ground is down here maybe 10, 20 feet. you have seen subsidence in the area. so the over-drafting in this area and some in the sacramento valley as well as in the salinas valley is a serious problem. part of what we want to do, mirroring what the state has already decided to do with proposition 1, is to [[page h845]] have the federal government work with the state on addressing the aquifers in this region to find ways to recharge the aquifers. there are many different ways that that can be done. some of it is simply pumping the water back into the ground rather than pumping it out. in other areas, the geology in various parts, particularly along the coastal mountains as well as along the sierra nevada mountains, there are gravel channels, old river channels that have historically recharged the groundwater basins in parts--actually, along most of the central valley. so it has to be done. this is what we are trying to do with this legislation: desalination research, which i discussed earlier, $100 million; water storage, $600 million; water recycling, $200 million; and $55 million for specific protections for the fish and wildlife species. there is a whole series of projects that would fit into that. once again, all of this infrastructure work is designed to coordinate specifically with what the state of california is doing with their multibillion-dollar proposition 1. this isn't in effect yet, but this money is now working its way through the various environmental studies and various levels of government so that very soon these projects will be underway. if we are able to pass the legislation that we want to introduce, we are going to see the federal government working very, very closely with the state government in addressing the california problem. now, who cares about california? if you care about food, your fresh veggies, you had better care about california. over here in the salinas valley where lettuce comes from? drought problems. in the central valley, let's see. you name the crop, everything from rice to walnuts--oh, wine grapes are very, very important if you like your wine. in the central coast down here, the same thing. so what we are trying to do with the legislation is to provide a long-term fix to california so that we can increase the supply of water, increase the storage during the wet years, put the storage in reservoirs and in the aquifers so that, when the dry years come, then we will do it. there was a fellow by the name of steinbeck. he wrote a book, ``east of eden.'' in that book, he talked about the california droughts. this is not a new situation, although 5 years and 4 years is definitely new. usually, the droughts would be 1 or 2 years. but now we are looking at quite possibly a 5-year drought. steinbeck said this. it is not the exact quote, although i wish i had it. it was like this: in the dry years, they worried about where their water would come from. then the wet years would come and they forgot about the dry years. that has been the story of california for too many--too many-- decades. certainly steinbeck saw that in the early part of the 20th century. we are now in the 21st century and we cannot--we cannot--relive that old adage that steinbeck wrote about. so we need to build for the future. we need to be able to address this in the immediate as best we can and put in place the water systems. i am going to describe those water systems to you just very briefly. here in the north we have the great shasta reservoir up here on the upper sacramento river. it could be raised. it could be increased. there are some environmental and certainly some cost issues associated with raising shasta. that is one of the proposals of possibilities in our legislation. the other one sits right about in here off stream. the sacramento river flows down through the middle of the valley here, but off-stream over here in my district actually is a potential reservoir that has been talked about for maybe 50 years now called sites reservoir. it stores about 1.8 million acre-feet of water. it could deliver annually 500,000 acre-feet of water. that is a lot of water. that is 1 foot of water across 5,000 acres. did i say 5,000? it is 500,000 acres. so that is the sites reservoir over here. that reservoir also does something really unique. since it is off- river, it will take the water flowing down the sacramento river during the heavy storms, put that water into the reservoir, and then, when summer comes or the drought comes, that water can be released back into the sacramento river, providing water quality issues here in the delta of california--and i will come to that in just a few moments--creating flexibility on the great reservoirs--shasta, the yuba system, the folsom reservoir here in sacramento, and the big california reservoir in oroville--allowing the operations of those reservoirs to be modified in such a way that they are able to store water rather than releasing it down the river for fish and wildlife. it would then be able to release water from sites reservoir and keep that water back in these reservoirs. a major problem in sacramento is that the folsom reservoir is at low tide. i will have tomorrow representatives from the east sacramento area in my office, all of them saying: oh, my goodness. we don't have enough water in folsom reservoir for our cities of rancho cordova, roseville, and the like, east of sacramento. so sites reservoir could provide more water in the sacramento region by keeping that water in the folsom reservoir. let's talk a little bit about the delta. i guess i had better finish the other reservoirs. down here in the fresno area on the san joaquin river we have the big friant reservoir on the san joaquin. there is a bit of a problem with friant. it managed to dry up the san joaquin river, creating a big, big problem for the salmon. they don't do very well in dry rivers. so there is an effort underway to try to restore some of the salmon on the rivers in the san joaquin valley, the stanislaus, the merced, and the other rivers as you move down towards the san joaquin. there would be a new reservoir that is proposed here at temperance flat. is it possible? yes. is it environmentally controversial? oh, yeah. no doubt about that. and it is expensive. but, nonetheless, our legislation would authorize a continuation of the studies to see if it is worth doing. so that would be the temperance flat. over here on the hills to the east of oakland there is another storage reservoir off-stream, and that one is called los vaqueros. los vaqueros is a reservoir that is controlled by the contra costa water district. they now have agreements with other water districts in the bay area to increase the size of that reservoir to store more water at that area. again, that is off-stream. it would take the high winter flows and put that water in storage off-stream as with sites reservoir to the north of it, all very, very important. so these are the essential projects that would be long term for california. again, they would be the surface storage reservoirs, two off-stream and three potentially on-stream. they would be recharging the aquifers and the various infrastructure needed to do that, recycling in the great cities of los angeles, san diego, and in the bay area to recycle water and, also, dealing with the contamination that occurs in many of the cities in the central valley, the san joaquin valley particularly, a little bit up here in the sacramento valley, and a lot of problems in the salinas valley in this area. so those are the essential elements of the long term--i forgot conservation and desalination. so those are the long-term projects that are both in proposition 1 of the california water bond of 2014 and, also, in our legislation. the second piece of the legislation deals with the operation of the two great water projects. these are the largest water projects in the world, although china is building one that might actually be bigger. but, as of today, the largest water projects in the world are in california. what they basically do--maybe i will back up here a bit. it would be great if my colleagues here really had a sense of what is happening. the basic water projects of california take the water from the sacramento valley, the sacramento river, mount shasta up here, and the trinity river, bring that water in through the shasta reservoir, hold the water there, and then send the water down the sacramento river to the delta. [[page h846]] {time} 2030 from the delta, that water is picked up in canals--two of them, one operated by the federal government, the other one operated by the state of california--and brings that water--the federal government--down into the san joaquin valley, where it provides hundreds of thousands of acres of irrigated agricultural production. the other part of that project is here on the san joaquin. that takes water down the east side of the valley, all the way to kern county, down here in the bakersfield area, and north up into the madera county area here. that is called the friant-kern system. that is the federal water project. the state water project, like the federal, takes the water out of the delta here and brings it down in the canal, all the way down here, providing water to kern county, and then pumps that water 2,000 feet over the tehachapi mountains through tunnels and canals into southern california. it flows down through the western part of the mohave desert down here, and then flows into the los angeles area, and also into the palm springs area all the way over here. that is the california water project. some of that water flowing into the metropolitan water district is then available for the cities and water districts of southern california, all the way down to san diego and into the coachella valley over here in the palm springs area. it is one huge water project, all of it dependent on the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere. there is no other estuary anywhere from chile to alaska as large and as important to the aquatic species and birds as the great delta of the sacramento-san joaquin river system. unlike many deltas, this is an inland delta. this is the beginning of san francisco bay here. it goes on out. the golden gate bridge and san francisco are just further to the west. once again, the water flows southward down the sacramento river, past the city of sacramento, and flows down through the delta, picked up by the great pumps here at tracy into the canals, and down the canals to the san joaquin valley and on to southern california. here is the problem: the pumping has significantly altered the ecology of the delta and, when coupled with the drought, has created a situation that has led to a very serious potential of the extinction of species in the delta, particularly the delta smelt. because of the alteration of the sacramento river system's normal flow, the salmon, which would normally migrate up the sacramento river all the way to mount shasta and beyond or down the san joaquin river system to fresno, that migration pattern has been seriously altered. in normal years, the management of the river is such that the salmon are able to get along, not as well as they once did when it was said you could walk across the river on the back of salmon--you can't do that today for sure--but, nonetheless, in a normal year these river systems, excluding the lower san joaquin, are able to produce a significant salmon run. in the delta, the delta smelt have been under great pressure since the pumps were put in. the smelt is a little, tiny fish, but it happens to be like the foundation fish--all the bigger fish eat it. and it is also what we call the canary in the coal mine. if you remember what that is all about, you use canaries in a coal mine. when the canary keels over, you have got a serious problem because you are the next to keel over--bad air. well, here these delta smelt are considered to be the canary in the water. when they are in deep trouble--and they are today--the question arises: is the entire ecosystem of the delta going to collapse? we think not. but california is severely stressed. california is still in drought. today, the rainfall in california is 75 percent of normal. that is for the entire state. for the sacramento region, february is 22 percent of normal, and i think we are rapidly approaching the end of february. what that means for the delta is extraordinary stress--extraordinary stress--and a monumental california water fight. my great-grandfather came to california in the 1860s to mine for gold. during that time, there was a fellow out there by the name of mark twain, who was writing about the gold rush and other things that were going on in california. he said a couple of things that are really interesting. about san francisco, he said that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in san francisco. i think he was referring to the fog. he also said that in california in the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, he said: ``whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over.'' so it has been. during the gold rush period, it was all about water. you couldn't mine for gold unless you had water, and people fought over water. they built incredible systems to get their hands on the water that came out of the sierra nevada mountains. today, it is the same. we still fight about water. what senator feinstein and i are trying to do is to reduce the friction, reduce the fighting that has been going on for the last decade, or last 5 years, about water as it flows through the delta. my san joaquin valley colleagues, democrat and republican, have put forth two pieces of legislation that they believe would solve the water problem for them. what they have managed to do with that legislation is to basically wipe out the environmental protection for the species-- salmon, smelt, and other species in the delta--and simply say: turn the pumps on. we need the water. we have got the votes. we are going to get the water. those two pieces of legislation have not become law, and they never should become law, because if they did, the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere would be in serious jeopardy. what we propose is to work within the environmental laws and the biological opinions that have been put forth by the federal and state fish and wildlife agencies and the national marine fisheries service-- the national marine fisheries service concerned about the salmon; the fish and wildlife agencies concerned about the endemic species of the delta--to work within those biological opinions which are designed to protect those species and say the flexibility that is allowed under the endangered species act, the clean water act, and the biological opinions are sufficient to allow for the maximum amount of pumping to the south from the delta consistent with the protection of the species. in order to accomplish that, we need to use science. the biological opinions are based on about 13- to 15-year-old science. what we are saying in our legislation is ramp up the science. senator feinstein was able to deliver $100 million to california fish agencies to put in place realtime monitoring. she was not able to write how that could occur, so in the legislation we would direct the agencies to conduct real-time monitoring, daily monitoring. as the winter flows--and there have been winter flows thus far this year, not enough, but they are there. as those winter flows enter the delta from the north and the south, the fish agencies study where are the smelt, where are the salmon coming down the sacramento river, and also from the san joaquin river. if they are near the delta pumps, reduce the pumping, or don't pump at all, depending where those fish are. if they are not, if they have moved away from the pumps and there is water in the system, then turn the pumps on. pretty simple: if the fish are endangered, reduce the pumping; if the fish are not endangered, then increase the pumping. that is essentially what our legislation would accomplish. there are other elements to it, for example, putting in fish screens at the delta cross channel on the georgiana slough, and also to improve the levee system within the delta. we will see. we will see what happens here. we have a choice as members of congress and men and women that are supposed to solve problems. we can go the way of my san joaquin valley colleagues and simply push aside, negate, the environmental laws that provide for the protection of the salmon, the great fishing industry of california, the salmon runs up and down the coast. by the way, the salmon that come out of the sacramento river provide salmon all the way to the columbia river in oregon. so it is not just about san francisco bay. it is about the salmon and the fishing industry for much of the west coast, also south through monterey bay. [[page h847]] can we wipe out the environmental laws and simply turn the pumps on? yes, if that legislation were to pass that has been offered by my colleagues from the san joaquin valley. or we can work within the environmental laws, achieving maximum flexibility, understanding the science: where are the salmon or the salmonoids? those are the salmon that have hatched and are coming back down the river, little, tiny salmon. where are they? are they coming down the river and getting sucked to the pumps, or are they coming down the river and heading out to the bay? we don't know today. we are not doing real-time monitoring. if we did real-time monitoring, we would know where they are. we would know where the delta smelt are and other species, and we could adjust the pumping to protect the species and to take advantage of the high flows that occur during the normal winters and also this year, even though it is well below normal. i have confidence. i have confidence in the wisdom of the californians who decided that they would pass a water bond to put in place long-range solutions for california--recycling, conservation, storage systems, underground aquifers--and to develop safe drinking water. i have confidence in the wisdom of california because they voted by over 60 percent for this project. i have confidence in the congress. i have confidence in the senate. senator feinstein has come up with a good bill. i had the honor to work with her on that bill, and i will soon introduce that bill here in the house. i have confidence that we have the wisdom and we have the understanding of the systems of california water to maximize over time the water potential of california. and in the near term, in the near term when california, this great state that we would like to see as green, when california is faced with this, i have got confidence that we are wise enough and we are smart enough politically to maneuver ourselves into a situation where we can address the current drought to the maximum extent possible, delivering water to the san joaquin valley and on into southern california without harming the fish, without destroying the salmon of california and the fishing, the multibillion- dollar fishing industry that goes with it, and without jeopardizing the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere. that is our challenge. this is what we are going to try to accomplish. senator feinstein's bill has been introduced. that version will be introduced over here in the next several days as we develop a better understanding among my colleagues of what we are trying to accomplish here. {time} 2045 i have confidence that the representatives of the southern california area will see the wisdom of putting aside what mark twain said we always do in california: fighting over water and getting about drinking more whiskey. probably a pretty good idea. i think we are going to get southern california support for this. i think the san joaquin valley folks will look at this and say: well, we can continue fighting as we have for the last 5 years with no progress, none, nada, zero. let's see if we can figure out how to do this in a way that protects the species, the salmon, the other fish, that protects the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere, and that provides the maximum amount of water that is available to california, which, by the way, has an economy that is ranked seventh in the world. so water is really important. i know we can do better. i know that this nation doesn't have to have this kind of water in flint, michigan. i know that this nation doesn't have to have children in the central valley of california getting their water out of a cattle water trough. i know that this nation doesn't have to destroy the largest estuary and all of the fish, all of the salmon, and all of the industry that goes with that in its quest for water and that what little is available can be shared and maximized. that is what we are going to try to do with the feinstein-garamendi legislation. i know we can do it. i know we have to do it. i know, at the end of the day, we are not going to destroy. we are going to build, we are going to create, and we are going to solve the problem. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",33773

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgH847,CREC-2016-02-23,114,"IN TRIBUTE TO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA, A PREEMINENT MIND","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H847-H850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN TRIBUTE TO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA, A PREEMINENT MIND The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in tribute to one of the greatest jurists in this Nation's history. Justice Antonin Scalia had a preeminent mind following an excellent education. He has a beautiful family and has already been very sorely missed. I thought it might be helpful, Mr. Speaker, to get a sense of the man and how profoundly concerned he was with the place in which this country finds itself after world wars, after depressions, after all kinds of threats: a massive civil war in the 1860s, all kinds of things that have threatened this Nation, even the War of 1812 during which this Capitol was set on fire. There were all of these threats; yet, at this time in which we live, he could see and he tried to sound the warning alarms for what the majority of the Supreme Court was doing to this country. It seemed to be encapsulated rather well back in the June 12, 2008, decision in the case of Boumediene vs. George W. Bush, President of the United States, combined with another case. The decision of the majority of the Court, as Justice Scalia pointed out, was so totally inconsistent with the majority's own majority opinion in a prior case regarding people who were captured on the battlefield and who were clearly at war with the United States. Throughout the history of warfare at least among civilized nations during the period of warfare, the civilized thing to do was to hold those who were at war with you until such time as the groups they represent, they come from, declare they are no longer at war with you. Then they can be released unless they have committed some heinous crime for which they should account beyond that of being part of the war against the Nation. The Supreme Court majority had previously said basically that, of course, the Constitution gives the Congress the power to create tribunals, to create courts. As my former constitutional law professor said, there is only one Court in the whole country's Federal system that owes its creation to the U.S. Constitution, and that is the U.S. Supreme Court. All other Federal courts, tribunals, owe their existences and their jurisdictions to the United States Congress. So the majority Court had previously said, in effect, that Congress could, in cases where enemy combatants are seized on the battlefield, hold them without right of writ of habeas corpus, because that has basically been the history of civilized warfare. Obviously, in uncivilized warfare, people were taken, abused, tortured, made slaves. That has happened throughout the history of mankind. But for nations that were civilized, you simply held them, hopefully, in humanitarian conditions. In the Boumediene case, Justice Scalia starts his dissent by writing: ``I shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to the legal errors contained in the opinion of the Court. Contrary to my usual practice, however, I think it appropriate to begin with a description of the disastrous consequences of what the Court has done today.'' Justice Scalia goes on: ``America is at war with radical Islamists. The enemy began by killing Americans and American allies abroad: 241 at the Marine barracks in Lebanon, 19 at the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, 224 at our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and 17 on the USS Cole in Yemen. ``On September 11, 2001, the enemy brought the battle to American soil, killing 2,749 at the Twin Towers in New York City, 184 at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and 40 in Pennsylvania. ``It has threatened further attacks against our homeland; one need only [[Page H848]] walk about buttressed and barricaded Washington or board a plane anywhere in the country to know that the threat is a serious one. Our Armed Forces are now in the field against the enemy, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed. ``The game of bait-and-switch that today's opinion plays upon the Nation's Commander in Chief will make the war harder on us.'' What comes next is, perhaps, one of the most profound statements that any Justice on the Supreme Court ever put in writing, but he was right. And being right in his discernment of the Supreme Court's decision, he knew he needed to put this next sentence in print. So, in talking about the majority opinion, Justice Scalia wrote this: ``It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.'' He wrote: ``That consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time-honored legal principle vital to our constitutional Republic. But it is this Court's blatant abandonment of such a principle that produces the decision today. The President relied on our settled precedent in Johnson vs. Eisentrager''--this was back in 1950--``when he established the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy aliens. Citing that case, the President's Office of Legal Counsel advised him `that the great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district court could not properly exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien detained at Guantanamo Bay.''' Further down, the Justice writes: ``In the short term, however, the decision is devastating. At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to the battlefield. ``But others have succeeded in carrying on their atrocities against innocent civilians. In one case, a detainee released from Guantanamo Bay masterminded the kidnapping of two Chinese dam workers, one of whom was later shot to death when used as a human shield against Pakistani commandos. ``Another former detainee promptly resumed his post as a senior Taliban commander and murdered a United Nations engineer and three Afghan soldiers. Still another murdered an Afghan judge. It was reported only last month that a released detainee carried out a suicide bombing against Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, Iraq. ``Their return to the kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of assessing who is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign theater of operations where the environment does not lend itself to rigorous evidence collection.'' Justice Scalia goes on: ``During the 1995 prosecution of Omar Abdel Rahman, federal prosecutors gave the names of 200 unindicted coconspirators to the `Blind Sheikh's' defense lawyers; that information was in the hands of Osama Bin Laden within two weeks.'' Justice Scalia went on to write page after page, explaining the perils that the overzealous and underthinking majority of the Court had imposed on the United States, on our military. Justice Scalia made clear, when it comes to war, the decision that the majority made was to basically tell our military: Instead of protecting yourselves and protecting your brothers and sisters in arms, we are going to require you to go out there, gather up DNA evidence, get blood evidence, maybe just drive a forensic wagon out there onto the field of battle. Start gathering evidence because some moronic person in a palace in Washington--``palace'' being what some of the Justices who first went through the new Supreme Court building said about it back in 1935, that palace in which they reside--has said that, in a time of war, we have lost our mind in America, and we are going to now start putting our military at risk of their very lives so they can go gather up evidence to satisfy some bloated judge in a palace in Washington. That is why he made the profound statement that he did in this dissent. {time} 2100 His words will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed. That is extraordinary. Dear Justice Scalia finished the dissenting opinion by saying: ``Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that goes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the Suspension Clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable `functional' test for the extra territorial reach of habeas corpus (and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well). It blatantly misdescribes important precedents, most conspicuously Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court in Johnson v. Eisentrager. It breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law that prohibits judicial inquiry into the detention of aliens abroad absent statutory authorization. And, most tragically, it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court, under whatever standards this Court devises in the future, that evidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner. ``The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done today. I dissent.'' What a magnificent man. What a brilliant man with extraordinary common sense. So, Mr. Speaker, my staff helped me. We have all been picking out favorite quotes that Justice Scalia has provided, both in written opinion and in speeches. One of Justice Scalia's statements was: ``Never compromise your principles, unless, of course, your principles are Adolph Hitler's, in which case you would be well-advised to compromise them as much as you can.'' Another statement by Justice Scalia was: ``More important than your obligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your conscience correctly.'' Justice Scalia said: ``You think there ought to be a right to abortion? No problem. The Constitution says nothing about it. Create it the way most rights are created in a democratic society. Pass a law. And that law, unlike a constitutional right to abortion created by a court can compromise.'' Justice Scalia said: ``A Constitution is not meant to facilitate change. It is meant to impede change, to make it difficult to change.'' Brilliant statement. Some think the Constitution is a living, breathing document. I have discussed this over at the Supreme Court palace with him, and I have discussed it with him at lunches, breakfasts. There are a handful of special privileges that I count myself blessed to have been able to enjoy, and one of those handful has been time spent with Justice Scalia. He had an incredible sense of humor. He could crack me up. Most of the time, he meant to. Sometimes his sarcasm was just too humorous not to laugh. And he attacked himself with self- effacing humor. He said this: ``I attack ideas. I don't attack people. And some very good people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate the two, you've gotta get another day job.'' He was a funny man, but a brilliant man. God blessed that man with wisdom. Justice Scalia said: ``I love to argue. I've always loved to argue. And I love to point out the weaknesses of the opposing arguments. It may well be that I'm something of a shin kicker. It may well be that I'm something of a contrarian.'' He said: ``Well, we didn't set out to have nine children''--talking about his beautiful family. He said: ``We're just old-fashioned Catholics, you know.'' Justice Scalia said: ``I think Thomas Jefferson would have said the more speech, the better. That's what the First Amendment is all about.'' Today I see around our college campuses conservatives like me are often shunned. I am grateful to have been invited to speak at Oxford in England and at Cambridge. But it is amazing that places like my conservative Texas A&M, there are students there--much fewer there, but all over the country at what are supposed to be enlightened universities--that don't want to hear any view different from themselves. When I was at A&M, I mean, I helped host Ralph Nader. I didn't agree with him on much, but I loved the exchange with him, the thoughts that went back and forth. He was a very intriguing man. We weren't afraid of discussions with liberals. It is one of the things I loved about Justice Scalia. He was so brilliant, so [[Page H849]] grounded. His faith was so strongly standing on God's Word, the Bible. He knew who he was. He knew whose he was, and he knew whose was his, and he loved his family dearly. Justice Scalia said: ``Undoubtedly, some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.'' It was absolutely a great dissent. Pointing out the hypocrisy, the flawed thinking, the incredible poor quality of the writing in the majority opinion in the ObamaCare decision, Justice Scalia said: ``This Court, however, concludes that this limitation would prevent the rest of the act from working as well as hoped. So it rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law SCOTUSCare instead of ObamaCare.'' The Supreme Court of the U.S. care, how about that? He went on to say: ``Under all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the government should lose this case. But normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of this Court: The Affordable Care Act must be saved.'' He goes on. It says: ``If a bill is about to pass that really comes down hard on some minority and they think it's terribly unfair, it doesn't take much to throw a monkey wrench into this complex system. Americans should appreciate that; they should learn to love the gridlock. It's there so the legislation that does get out is good legislation.'' Mr. Speaker, it brings to mind a discussion I heard him have with some people from my district, some senior citizens that were coming to Washington, 50 or 60. They had asked me: They say you are friends with Justice Scalia. Do you think we could meet him? I felt comfortable enough to call him. He said: Sure. Bring them. So we worked it out, brought them through the side entrance, came into a meeting room. They were all seated there when Justice Scalia came walking in. He leans up against the table in front of them, and they were kind of in awe because they knew how brilliant Justice Scalia was. He said: Well, you wanted to meet me. Here I am. What questions have you got? It kind of took the group aback, so people were struggling to try to come up with a question. Finally, one of them said: Well, Justice Scalia, wouldn't you say that we are the freest Nation in the history of the world because we have the best Bill of Rights? In typical Scalia style, he said: Oh, gosh, no. The Soviet Union had a much better bill of rights than we have got. It guaranteed a lot more freedoms than we have. And I've forgotten, but in college I made an A on a paper that discussed the Soviet constitution and the bill of rights. He was right. That old Soviet bill of rights guaranteed all kinds of rights, but it didn't protect them. He went on to say--and I am not quoting exactly--but the gist of what he had to say is, now, the reason America is the most free Nation in the history of the world is because the Founders didn't trust the government, so they made it as difficult as they could to pass a law. It wasn't enough to have one House; they wanted two Houses, and not like England where one of them doesn't have all that much authority. They wanted two Houses where either one of them could stop a law from being passed. So even if one House were successful in finally getting a majority of people to agree on a law, then the other House would have to agree, and they could stop it completely in its tracks. That wasn't good enough. They wanted another check and balance, another way to stop law. They wanted to create gridlock. So they said: You know what? We don't want a parliamentarian system where the legislators elect a prime minister. No. We want an executive elected totally different from the legislature. So we will have him elected in a whole different way, and then he can stop any law they may try to pass. And that is not good enough. Let's create another branch, the judiciary branch, and then they can nix anything that is passed. No, we are the most free Nation in history because the Founders didn't trust government and they made it as hard as possible to pass laws. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. GOHMERT. Justice Scalia says in one of his dissents: ``I have exceeded the speed limit on occasion.'' He said: ``A man who has no enemies is probably not a very good man.'' He said: ``If you read the rest of the section, you would say, to find a way to find a meaning that the language will bear that will uphold the constitutionality. You don't interpret a penalty to be a pig. It can't be a pig.'' He did know how to bring things back to tangible terms. He said: ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.'' I've experienced that myself. There were times I disagreed with the law, but it was constitutionally made and passed, and I followed the law as a judge and chief justice. That is exactly what he did. In a dissent in 1996, Justice Scalia said: ``The Court must be living in an another world. Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution for a country I do not recognize.'' Ten years later, in 2006, he says: ``So the question comes up, is there a constitutional right to have homosexual conduct? Not a hard question for me. It's absolutely clear that nobody ever thought when the Bill of Rights was adopted that it gave a right to homosexual conduct. Homosexual conduct was criminal for 200 years in every State. Easy question.'' He made those statements in remarks at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, back in 2006. In 2009, he said: ``The Court today continues its quixotic quest to right all wrongs and repair all imperfections through the Constitution. Alas, the quest cannot succeed.'' He also said: ``This case, involving legal requirements of the content and labeling of meat products such as frankfurters affords a rare opportunity to explore simultaneously both parts of Bismarck's aphorism that `no man should see how laws or sausages are made.''' He said: ``God has been very good to us. One of the reasons God has been good to us is that we have done him honor.'' Certainly, Justice Scalia did God honor. A lot of people don't realize what a tenderhearted man he was as well. After the horrendous murder of Justice Michael Luttig's father and the assault and attempted murder of his mother in their own garage, two streets over from my house, the family did not want to call Michael and describe the horrors that had been inflicted on his father and mother. {time} 2115 Middle of the night, Justice Scalia is in bed. Justice Scalia gets called, would he go out to Michael Luttig, Judge Luttig's house, and let him know in the wee hours of the morning that his father had been killed. Justice Scalia, for whom Judge Luttig had clerked, he knew Michael Luttig loved him. He put on his warmup suit and went out in the middle of the night many miles away because he cared. As I conclude, Mr. Speaker, I thought about the words of John Quincy Adams in the Amistad case. He didn't think he had won the case. He was finishing. He was afraid he had not done an adequate job defending these Africans who should be free and should be free to go where they wanted without chains, without bondage. So he finished his argument by saying, and this is John Quincy Adams, 1841, in the Supreme Court: ``As I cast my eyes along those seats of honor and public trust, now occupied by you, they seek in vain for one of those honored and honorable persons whose indulgence listened then to my voice. Marshall, Cushing, Chase, Washington, Johnson, Livingston, Todd--where are they? Where is that eloquent [[Page H850]] statesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in the management of that cause, Robert Goodloe Harper? Where is that brilliant luminary, so long the pride of Maryland and of the American Bar, then my opposing counsel, Luther Martin? Where is the excellent clerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of Africa, as a monument of his abhorrence of the African slave trade Elias B. Caldwell? Where is the marshal? Where are the criers of the Court? Alas, where is one of the very judges of the Court, arbiters of life and death, before whom I commenced the anxious argument, even now prematurely closed? Where are they all? Gone. Gone. All gone. Gone from the services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully rendered to their country. I humbly hope, and fondly trust, that they have gone to receive the rewards of blessedness on high.'' In taking, then, his final leave of the bar there at the Supreme Court, John Quincy Adams said he hoped that every member of the Supreme Court may go to his final account with as little of earthly frailty to answer for as those illustrious dead. And he said: ``That you may, every one, after the close of a long and virtuous career in this world, be received at the portals of the next with the approving sentence: `Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' '' Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt whatsoever that Justice Antonin Scalia, my friend, our friend, the luminary of the Supreme Court, heard those words days ago: ``Well done, good and faithful servant.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H847-H850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN TRIBUTE TO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA, A PREEMINENT MIND The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in tribute to one of the greatest jurists in this Nation's history. Justice Antonin Scalia had a preeminent mind following an excellent education. He has a beautiful family and has already been very sorely missed. I thought it might be helpful, Mr. Speaker, to get a sense of the man and how profoundly concerned he was with the place in which this country finds itself after world wars, after depressions, after all kinds of threats: a massive civil war in the 1860s, all kinds of things that have threatened this Nation, even the War of 1812 during which this Capitol was set on fire. There were all of these threats; yet, at this time in which we live, he could see and he tried to sound the warning alarms for what the majority of the Supreme Court was doing to this country. It seemed to be encapsulated rather well back in the June 12, 2008, decision in the case of Boumediene vs. George W. Bush, President of the United States, combined with another case. The decision of the majority of the Court, as Justice Scalia pointed out, was so totally inconsistent with the majority's own majority opinion in a prior case regarding people who were captured on the battlefield and who were clearly at war with the United States. Throughout the history of warfare at least among civilized nations during the period of warfare, the civilized thing to do was to hold those who were at war with you until such time as the groups they represent, they come from, declare they are no longer at war with you. Then they can be released unless they have committed some heinous crime for which they should account beyond that of being part of the war against the Nation. The Supreme Court majority had previously said basically that, of course, the Constitution gives the Congress the power to create tribunals, to create courts. As my former constitutional law professor said, there is only one Court in the whole country's Federal system that owes its creation to the U.S. Constitution, and that is the U.S. Supreme Court. All other Federal courts, tribunals, owe their existences and their jurisdictions to the United States Congress. So the majority Court had previously said, in effect, that Congress could, in cases where enemy combatants are seized on the battlefield, hold them without right of writ of habeas corpus, because that has basically been the history of civilized warfare. Obviously, in uncivilized warfare, people were taken, abused, tortured, made slaves. That has happened throughout the history of mankind. But for nations that were civilized, you simply held them, hopefully, in humanitarian conditions. In the Boumediene case, Justice Scalia starts his dissent by writing: ``I shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to the legal errors contained in the opinion of the Court. Contrary to my usual practice, however, I think it appropriate to begin with a description of the disastrous consequences of what the Court has done today.'' Justice Scalia goes on: ``America is at war with radical Islamists. The enemy began by killing Americans and American allies abroad: 241 at the Marine barracks in Lebanon, 19 at the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, 224 at our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and 17 on the USS Cole in Yemen. ``On September 11, 2001, the enemy brought the battle to American soil, killing 2,749 at the Twin Towers in New York City, 184 at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and 40 in Pennsylvania. ``It has threatened further attacks against our homeland; one need only [[Page H848]] walk about buttressed and barricaded Washington or board a plane anywhere in the country to know that the threat is a serious one. Our Armed Forces are now in the field against the enemy, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed. ``The game of bait-and-switch that today's opinion plays upon the Nation's Commander in Chief will make the war harder on us.'' What comes next is, perhaps, one of the most profound statements that any Justice on the Supreme Court ever put in writing, but he was right. And being right in his discernment of the Supreme Court's decision, he knew he needed to put this next sentence in print. So, in talking about the majority opinion, Justice Scalia wrote this: ``It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.'' He wrote: ``That consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time-honored legal principle vital to our constitutional Republic. But it is this Court's blatant abandonment of such a principle that produces the decision today. The President relied on our settled precedent in Johnson vs. Eisentrager''--this was back in 1950--``when he established the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy aliens. Citing that case, the President's Office of Legal Counsel advised him `that the great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district court could not properly exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien detained at Guantanamo Bay.''' Further down, the Justice writes: ``In the short term, however, the decision is devastating. At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to the battlefield. ``But others have succeeded in carrying on their atrocities against innocent civilians. In one case, a detainee released from Guantanamo Bay masterminded the kidnapping of two Chinese dam workers, one of whom was later shot to death when used as a human shield against Pakistani commandos. ``Another former detainee promptly resumed his post as a senior Taliban commander and murdered a United Nations engineer and three Afghan soldiers. Still another murdered an Afghan judge. It was reported only last month that a released detainee carried out a suicide bombing against Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, Iraq. ``Their return to the kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of assessing who is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign theater of operations where the environment does not lend itself to rigorous evidence collection.'' Justice Scalia goes on: ``During the 1995 prosecution of Omar Abdel Rahman, federal prosecutors gave the names of 200 unindicted coconspirators to the `Blind Sheikh's' defense lawyers; that information was in the hands of Osama Bin Laden within two weeks.'' Justice Scalia went on to write page after page, explaining the perils that the overzealous and underthinking majority of the Court had imposed on the United States, on our military. Justice Scalia made clear, when it comes to war, the decision that the majority made was to basically tell our military: Instead of protecting yourselves and protecting your brothers and sisters in arms, we are going to require you to go out there, gather up DNA evidence, get blood evidence, maybe just drive a forensic wagon out there onto the field of battle. Start gathering evidence because some moronic person in a palace in Washington--``palace'' being what some of the Justices who first went through the new Supreme Court building said about it back in 1935, that palace in which they reside--has said that, in a time of war, we have lost our mind in America, and we are going to now start putting our military at risk of their very lives so they can go gather up evidence to satisfy some bloated judge in a palace in Washington. That is why he made the profound statement that he did in this dissent. {time} 2100 His words will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed. That is extraordinary. Dear Justice Scalia finished the dissenting opinion by saying: ``Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that goes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the Suspension Clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable `functional' test for the extra territorial reach of habeas corpus (and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well). It blatantly misdescribes important precedents, most conspicuously Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court in Johnson v. Eisentrager. It breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law that prohibits judicial inquiry into the detention of aliens abroad absent statutory authorization. And, most tragically, it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court, under whatever standards this Court devises in the future, that evidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner. ``The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done today. I dissent.'' What a magnificent man. What a brilliant man with extraordinary common sense. So, Mr. Speaker, my staff helped me. We have all been picking out favorite quotes that Justice Scalia has provided, both in written opinion and in speeches. One of Justice Scalia's statements was: ``Never compromise your principles, unless, of course, your principles are Adolph Hitler's, in which case you would be well-advised to compromise them as much as you can.'' Another statement by Justice Scalia was: ``More important than your obligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your conscience correctly.'' Justice Scalia said: ``You think there ought to be a right to abortion? No problem. The Constitution says nothing about it. Create it the way most rights are created in a democratic society. Pass a law. And that law, unlike a constitutional right to abortion created by a court can compromise.'' Justice Scalia said: ``A Constitution is not meant to facilitate change. It is meant to impede change, to make it difficult to change.'' Brilliant statement. Some think the Constitution is a living, breathing document. I have discussed this over at the Supreme Court palace with him, and I have discussed it with him at lunches, breakfasts. There are a handful of special privileges that I count myself blessed to have been able to enjoy, and one of those handful has been time spent with Justice Scalia. He had an incredible sense of humor. He could crack me up. Most of the time, he meant to. Sometimes his sarcasm was just too humorous not to laugh. And he attacked himself with self- effacing humor. He said this: ``I attack ideas. I don't attack people. And some very good people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate the two, you've gotta get another day job.'' He was a funny man, but a brilliant man. God blessed that man with wisdom. Justice Scalia said: ``I love to argue. I've always loved to argue. And I love to point out the weaknesses of the opposing arguments. It may well be that I'm something of a shin kicker. It may well be that I'm something of a contrarian.'' He said: ``Well, we didn't set out to have nine children''--talking about his beautiful family. He said: ``We're just old-fashioned Catholics, you know.'' Justice Scalia said: ``I think Thomas Jefferson would have said the more speech, the better. That's what the First Amendment is all about.'' Today I see around our college campuses conservatives like me are often shunned. I am grateful to have been invited to speak at Oxford in England and at Cambridge. But it is amazing that places like my conservative Texas A&M, there are students there--much fewer there, but all over the country at what are supposed to be enlightened universities--that don't want to hear any view different from themselves.

His faith was so strongly standing on God's Word, the Bible. He knew who he was. He knew whose he was, and he knew whose was his, and he loved his family dearly. Justice Scalia said: ``Undoubtedly, some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.'' It was absolutely a great dissent. Pointing out the hypocrisy, the flawed thinking, the incredible poor quality of the writing in the majority opinion in the ObamaCare decision, Justice Scalia said: ``This Court, however, concludes that this limitation would prevent the rest of the act from working as well as hoped. So it rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law SCOTUSCare instead of ObamaCare.'' The Supreme Court of the U.S. care, how about that? He went on to say: ``Under all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the government should lose this case. But normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of this Court: The Affordable Care Act must be saved.'' He goes on. It says: ``If a bill is about to pass that really comes down hard on some minority and they think it's terribly unfair, it doesn't take much to throw a monkey wrench into this complex system. Americans should appreciate that; they should learn to love the gridlock. It's there so the legislation that does get out is good legislation.'' Mr. Speaker, it brings to mind a discussion I heard him have with some people from my district, some senior citizens that were coming to Washington, 50 or 60. They had asked me: They say you are friends with Justice Scalia. Do you think we could meet him? I felt comfortable enough to call him. He said: Sure. Bring them. So we worked it out, brought them through the side entrance, came into a meeting room. They were all seated there when Justice Scalia came walking in.

What questions have you got? It kind of took the group aback, so people were struggling to try to come up with a question. Finally, one of them said: Well, Justice Scalia, wouldn't you say that we are the freest Nation in the history of the world because we have the best Bill of Rights? In typical Scalia style, he said: Oh, gosh, no. The Soviet Union had a much better bill of rights than we have got. It guaranteed a lot more freedoms than we have. And I've forgotten, but in college I made an A on a paper that discussed the Soviet constitution and the bill of rights. He was right.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H847-H850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN TRIBUTE TO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA, A PREEMINENT MIND The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in tribute to one of the greatest jurists in this Nation's history. Justice Antonin Scalia had a preeminent mind following an excellent education. He has a beautiful family and has already been very sorely missed. I thought it might be helpful, Mr. Speaker, to get a sense of the man and how profoundly concerned he was with the place in which this country finds itself after world wars, after depressions, after all kinds of threats: a massive civil war in the 1860s, all kinds of things that have threatened this Nation, even the War of 1812 during which this Capitol was set on fire. There were all of these threats; yet, at this time in which we live, he could see and he tried to sound the warning alarms for what the majority of the Supreme Court was doing to this country. It seemed to be encapsulated rather well back in the June 12, 2008, decision in the case of Boumediene vs. George W. Bush, President of the United States, combined with another case. The decision of the majority of the Court, as Justice Scalia pointed out, was so totally inconsistent with the majority's own majority opinion in a prior case regarding people who were captured on the battlefield and who were clearly at war with the United States. Throughout the history of warfare at least among civilized nations during the period of warfare, the civilized thing to do was to hold those who were at war with you until such time as the groups they represent, they come from, declare they are no longer at war with you. Then they can be released unless they have committed some heinous crime for which they should account beyond that of being part of the war against the Nation. The Supreme Court majority had previously said basically that, of course, the Constitution gives the Congress the power to create tribunals, to create courts. As my former constitutional law professor said, there is only one Court in the whole country's Federal system that owes its creation to the U.S. Constitution, and that is the U.S. Supreme Court. All other Federal courts, tribunals, owe their existences and their jurisdictions to the United States Congress. So the majority Court had previously said, in effect, that Congress could, in cases where enemy combatants are seized on the battlefield, hold them without right of writ of habeas corpus, because that has basically been the history of civilized warfare. Obviously, in uncivilized warfare, people were taken, abused, tortured, made slaves. That has happened throughout the history of mankind. But for nations that were civilized, you simply held them, hopefully, in humanitarian conditions. In the Boumediene case, Justice Scalia starts his dissent by writing: ``I shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to the legal errors contained in the opinion of the Court. Contrary to my usual practice, however, I think it appropriate to begin with a description of the disastrous consequences of what the Court has done today.'' Justice Scalia goes on: ``America is at war with radical Islamists. The enemy began by killing Americans and American allies abroad: 241 at the Marine barracks in Lebanon, 19 at the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, 224 at our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, and 17 on the USS Cole in Yemen. ``On September 11, 2001, the enemy brought the battle to American soil, killing 2,749 at the Twin Towers in New York City, 184 at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and 40 in Pennsylvania. ``It has threatened further attacks against our homeland; one need only [[Page H848]] walk about buttressed and barricaded Washington or board a plane anywhere in the country to know that the threat is a serious one. Our Armed Forces are now in the field against the enemy, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed. ``The game of bait-and-switch that today's opinion plays upon the Nation's Commander in Chief will make the war harder on us.'' What comes next is, perhaps, one of the most profound statements that any Justice on the Supreme Court ever put in writing, but he was right. And being right in his discernment of the Supreme Court's decision, he knew he needed to put this next sentence in print. So, in talking about the majority opinion, Justice Scalia wrote this: ``It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.'' He wrote: ``That consequence would be tolerable if necessary to preserve a time-honored legal principle vital to our constitutional Republic. But it is this Court's blatant abandonment of such a principle that produces the decision today. The President relied on our settled precedent in Johnson vs. Eisentrager''--this was back in 1950--``when he established the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy aliens. Citing that case, the President's Office of Legal Counsel advised him `that the great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district court could not properly exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien detained at Guantanamo Bay.''' Further down, the Justice writes: ``In the short term, however, the decision is devastating. At least 30 of those prisoners hitherto released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to the battlefield. ``But others have succeeded in carrying on their atrocities against innocent civilians. In one case, a detainee released from Guantanamo Bay masterminded the kidnapping of two Chinese dam workers, one of whom was later shot to death when used as a human shield against Pakistani commandos. ``Another former detainee promptly resumed his post as a senior Taliban commander and murdered a United Nations engineer and three Afghan soldiers. Still another murdered an Afghan judge. It was reported only last month that a released detainee carried out a suicide bombing against Iraqi soldiers in Mosul, Iraq. ``Their return to the kill illustrates the incredible difficulty of assessing who is and who is not an enemy combatant in a foreign theater of operations where the environment does not lend itself to rigorous evidence collection.'' Justice Scalia goes on: ``During the 1995 prosecution of Omar Abdel Rahman, federal prosecutors gave the names of 200 unindicted coconspirators to the `Blind Sheikh's' defense lawyers; that information was in the hands of Osama Bin Laden within two weeks.'' Justice Scalia went on to write page after page, explaining the perils that the overzealous and underthinking majority of the Court had imposed on the United States, on our military. Justice Scalia made clear, when it comes to war, the decision that the majority made was to basically tell our military: Instead of protecting yourselves and protecting your brothers and sisters in arms, we are going to require you to go out there, gather up DNA evidence, get blood evidence, maybe just drive a forensic wagon out there onto the field of battle. Start gathering evidence because some moronic person in a palace in Washington--``palace'' being what some of the Justices who first went through the new Supreme Court building said about it back in 1935, that palace in which they reside--has said that, in a time of war, we have lost our mind in America, and we are going to now start putting our military at risk of their very lives so they can go gather up evidence to satisfy some bloated judge in a palace in Washington. That is why he made the profound statement that he did in this dissent. {time} 2100 His words will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed. That is extraordinary. Dear Justice Scalia finished the dissenting opinion by saying: ``Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that goes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the Suspension Clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable `functional' test for the extra territorial reach of habeas corpus (and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well). It blatantly misdescribes important precedents, most conspicuously Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court in Johnson v. Eisentrager. It breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law that prohibits judicial inquiry into the detention of aliens abroad absent statutory authorization. And, most tragically, it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court, under whatever standards this Court devises in the future, that evidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner. ``The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done today. I dissent.'' What a magnificent man. What a brilliant man with extraordinary common sense. So, Mr. Speaker, my staff helped me. We have all been picking out favorite quotes that Justice Scalia has provided, both in written opinion and in speeches. One of Justice Scalia's statements was: ``Never compromise your principles, unless, of course, your principles are Adolph Hitler's, in which case you would be well-advised to compromise them as much as you can.'' Another statement by Justice Scalia was: ``More important than your obligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your conscience correctly.'' Justice Scalia said: ``You think there ought to be a right to abortion? No problem. The Constitution says nothing about it. Create it the way most rights are created in a democratic society. Pass a law. And that law, unlike a constitutional right to abortion created by a court can compromise.'' Justice Scalia said: ``A Constitution is not meant to facilitate change. It is meant to impede change, to make it difficult to change.'' Brilliant statement. Some think the Constitution is a living, breathing document. I have discussed this over at the Supreme Court palace with him, and I have discussed it with him at lunches, breakfasts. There are a handful of special privileges that I count myself blessed to have been able to enjoy, and one of those handful has been time spent with Justice Scalia. He had an incredible sense of humor. He could crack me up. Most of the time, he meant to. Sometimes his sarcasm was just too humorous not to laugh. And he attacked himself with self- effacing humor. He said this: ``I attack ideas. I don't attack people. And some very good people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate the two, you've gotta get another day job.'' He was a funny man, but a brilliant man. God blessed that man with wisdom. Justice Scalia said: ``I love to argue. I've always loved to argue. And I love to point out the weaknesses of the opposing arguments. It may well be that I'm something of a shin kicker. It may well be that I'm something of a contrarian.'' He said: ``Well, we didn't set out to have nine children''--talking about his beautiful family. He said: ``We're just old-fashioned Catholics, you know.'' Justice Scalia said: ``I think Thomas Jefferson would have said the more speech, the better. That's what the First Amendment is all about.'' Today I see around our college campuses conservatives like me are often shunned. I am grateful to have been invited to speak at Oxford in England and at Cambridge. But it is amazing that places like my conservative Texas A&M, there are students there--much fewer there, but all over the country at what are supposed to be enlightened universities--that don't want to hear any view different from themselves. When I was at A&M, I mean, I helped host Ralph Nader. I didn't agree with him on much, but I loved the exchange with him, the thoughts that went back and forth. He was a very intriguing man. We weren't afraid of discussions with liberals. It is one of the things I loved about Justice Scalia. He was so brilliant, so [[Page H849]] grounded. His faith was so strongly standing on God's Word, the Bible. He knew who he was. He knew whose he was, and he knew whose was his, and he loved his family dearly. Justice Scalia said: ``Undoubtedly, some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.'' It was absolutely a great dissent. Pointing out the hypocrisy, the flawed thinking, the incredible poor quality of the writing in the majority opinion in the ObamaCare decision, Justice Scalia said: ``This Court, however, concludes that this limitation would prevent the rest of the act from working as well as hoped. So it rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law SCOTUSCare instead of ObamaCare.'' The Supreme Court of the U.S. care, how about that? He went on to say: ``Under all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the government should lose this case. But normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of this Court: The Affordable Care Act must be saved.'' He goes on. It says: ``If a bill is about to pass that really comes down hard on some minority and they think it's terribly unfair, it doesn't take much to throw a monkey wrench into this complex system. Americans should appreciate that; they should learn to love the gridlock. It's there so the legislation that does get out is good legislation.'' Mr. Speaker, it brings to mind a discussion I heard him have with some people from my district, some senior citizens that were coming to Washington, 50 or 60. They had asked me: They say you are friends with Justice Scalia. Do you think we could meet him? I felt comfortable enough to call him. He said: Sure. Bring them. So we worked it out, brought them through the side entrance, came into a meeting room. They were all seated there when Justice Scalia came walking in. He leans up against the table in front of them, and they were kind of in awe because they knew how brilliant Justice Scalia was. He said: Well, you wanted to meet me. Here I am. What questions have you got? It kind of took the group aback, so people were struggling to try to come up with a question. Finally, one of them said: Well, Justice Scalia, wouldn't you say that we are the freest Nation in the history of the world because we have the best Bill of Rights? In typical Scalia style, he said: Oh, gosh, no. The Soviet Union had a much better bill of rights than we have got. It guaranteed a lot more freedoms than we have. And I've forgotten, but in college I made an A on a paper that discussed the Soviet constitution and the bill of rights. He was right. That old Soviet bill of rights guaranteed all kinds of rights, but it didn't protect them. He went on to say--and I am not quoting exactly--but the gist of what he had to say is, now, the reason America is the most free Nation in the history of the world is because the Founders didn't trust the government, so they made it as difficult as they could to pass a law. It wasn't enough to have one House; they wanted two Houses, and not like England where one of them doesn't have all that much authority. They wanted two Houses where either one of them could stop a law from being passed. So even if one House were successful in finally getting a majority of people to agree on a law, then the other House would have to agree, and they could stop it completely in its tracks. That wasn't good enough. They wanted another check and balance, another way to stop law. They wanted to create gridlock. So they said: You know what? We don't want a parliamentarian system where the legislators elect a prime minister. No. We want an executive elected totally different from the legislature. So we will have him elected in a whole different way, and then he can stop any law they may try to pass. And that is not good enough. Let's create another branch, the judiciary branch, and then they can nix anything that is passed. No, we are the most free Nation in history because the Founders didn't trust government and they made it as hard as possible to pass laws. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. GOHMERT. Justice Scalia says in one of his dissents: ``I have exceeded the speed limit on occasion.'' He said: ``A man who has no enemies is probably not a very good man.'' He said: ``If you read the rest of the section, you would say, to find a way to find a meaning that the language will bear that will uphold the constitutionality. You don't interpret a penalty to be a pig. It can't be a pig.'' He did know how to bring things back to tangible terms. He said: ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.'' I've experienced that myself. There were times I disagreed with the law, but it was constitutionally made and passed, and I followed the law as a judge and chief justice. That is exactly what he did. In a dissent in 1996, Justice Scalia said: ``The Court must be living in an another world. Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution for a country I do not recognize.'' Ten years later, in 2006, he says: ``So the question comes up, is there a constitutional right to have homosexual conduct? Not a hard question for me. It's absolutely clear that nobody ever thought when the Bill of Rights was adopted that it gave a right to homosexual conduct. Homosexual conduct was criminal for 200 years in every State. Easy question.'' He made those statements in remarks at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, back in 2006. In 2009, he said: ``The Court today continues its quixotic quest to right all wrongs and repair all imperfections through the Constitution. Alas, the quest cannot succeed.'' He also said: ``This case, involving legal requirements of the content and labeling of meat products such as frankfurters affords a rare opportunity to explore simultaneously both parts of Bismarck's aphorism that `no man should see how laws or sausages are made.''' He said: ``God has been very good to us. One of the reasons God has been good to us is that we have done him honor.'' Certainly, Justice Scalia did God honor. A lot of people don't realize what a tenderhearted man he was as well. After the horrendous murder of Justice Michael Luttig's father and the assault and attempted murder of his mother in their own garage, two streets over from my house, the family did not want to call Michael and describe the horrors that had been inflicted on his father and mother. {time} 2115 Middle of the night, Justice Scalia is in bed. Justice Scalia gets called, would he go out to Michael Luttig, Judge Luttig's house, and let him know in the wee hours of the morning that his father had been killed. Justice Scalia, for whom Judge Luttig had clerked, he knew Michael Luttig loved him. He put on his warmup suit and went out in the middle of the night many miles away because he cared. As I conclude, Mr. Speaker, I thought about the words of John Quincy Adams in the Amistad case. He didn't think he had won the case. He was finishing. He was afraid he had not done an adequate job defending these Africans who should be free and should be free to go where they wanted without chains, without bondage. So he finished his argument by saying, and this is John Quincy Adams, 1841, in the Supreme Court: ``As I cast my eyes along those seats of honor and public trust, now occupied by you, they seek in vain for one of those honored and honorable persons whose indulgence listened then to my voice. Marshall, Cushing, Chase, Washington, Johnson, Livingston, Todd--where are they? Where is that eloquent [[Page H850]] statesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in the management of that cause, Robert Goodloe Harper? Where is that brilliant luminary, so long the pride of Maryland and of the American Bar, then my opposing counsel, Luther Martin? Where is the excellent clerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of Africa, as a monument of his abhorrence of the African slave trade Elias B. Caldwell? Where is the marshal? Where are the criers of the Court? Alas, where is one of the very judges of the Court, arbiters of life and death, before whom I commenced the anxious argument, even now prematurely closed? Where are they all? Gone. Gone. All gone. Gone from the services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully rendered to their country. I humbly hope, and fondly trust, that they have gone to receive the rewards of blessedness on high.'' In taking, then, his final leave of the bar there at the Supreme Court, John Quincy Adams said he hoped that every member of the Supreme Court may go to his final account with as little of earthly frailty to answer for as those illustrious dead. And he said: ``That you may, every one, after the close of a long and virtuous career in this world, be received at the portals of the next with the approving sentence: `Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' '' Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt whatsoever that Justice Antonin Scalia, my friend, our friend, the luminary of the Supreme Court, heard those words days ago: ``Well done, good and faithful servant.'' Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,21890,21890,21961,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [house] [pages h847-h850] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in tribute to united states supreme court justice antonin scalia, a preeminent mind the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) for 30 minutes. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i rise tonight in tribute to one of the greatest jurists in this nation's history. justice antonin scalia had a preeminent mind following an excellent education. he has a beautiful family and has already been very sorely missed. i thought it might be helpful, mr. speaker, to get a sense of the man and how profoundly concerned he was with the place in which this country finds itself after world wars, after depressions, after all kinds of threats: a massive civil war in the 1860s, all kinds of things that have threatened this nation, even the war of 1812 during which this capitol was set on fire. there were all of these threats; yet, at this time in which we live, he could see and he tried to sound the warning alarms for what the majority of the supreme court was doing to this country. it seemed to be encapsulated rather well back in the june 12, 2008, decision in the case of boumediene vs. george w. bush, president of the united states, combined with another case. the decision of the majority of the court, as justice scalia pointed out, was so totally inconsistent with the majority's own majority opinion in a prior case regarding people who were captured on the battlefield and who were clearly at war with the united states. throughout the history of warfare at least among civilized nations during the period of warfare, the civilized thing to do was to hold those who were at war with you until such time as the groups they represent, they come from, declare they are no longer at war with you. then they can be released unless they have committed some heinous crime for which they should account beyond that of being part of the war against the nation. the supreme court majority had previously said basically that, of course, the constitution gives the congress the power to create tribunals, to create courts. as my former constitutional law professor said, there is only one court in the whole country's federal system that owes its creation to the u.s. constitution, and that is the u.s. supreme court. all other federal courts, tribunals, owe their existences and their jurisdictions to the united states congress. so the majority court had previously said, in effect, that congress could, in cases where enemy combatants are seized on the battlefield, hold them without right of writ of habeas corpus, because that has basically been the history of civilized warfare. obviously, in uncivilized warfare, people were taken, abused, tortured, made slaves. that has happened throughout the history of mankind. but for nations that were civilized, you simply held them, hopefully, in humanitarian conditions. in the boumediene case, justice scalia starts his dissent by writing: ``i shall devote most of what will be a lengthy opinion to the legal errors contained in the opinion of the court. contrary to my usual practice, however, i think it appropriate to begin with a description of the disastrous consequences of what the court has done today.'' justice scalia goes on: ``america is at war with radical islamists. the enemy began by killing americans and american allies abroad: 241 at the marine barracks in lebanon, 19 at the khobar towers in dhahran, 224 at our embassies in dar es salaam and nairobi, and 17 on the uss cole in yemen. ``on september 11, 2001, the enemy brought the battle to american soil, killing 2,749 at the twin towers in new york city, 184 at the pentagon in washington, d.c., and 40 in pennsylvania. ``it has threatened further attacks against our homeland; one need only [[page h848]] walk about buttressed and barricaded washington or board a plane anywhere in the country to know that the threat is a serious one. our armed forces are now in the field against the enemy, in afghanistan and iraq. last week, 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed. ``the game of bait-and-switch that today's opinion plays upon the nation's commander in chief will make the war harder on us.'' what comes next is, perhaps, one of the most profound statements that any justice on the supreme court ever put in writing, but he was right. and being right in his discernment of the supreme court's decision, he knew he needed to put this next sentence in print. so, in talking about the majority opinion, justice scalia wrote this: ``it will almost certainly cause more americans to be killed.'' he wrote: ``that consequence would be tolerable if

the battlefield. ``but others have succeeded in carrying on their atrocities against innocent civilians. in one case, a detainee released from guantanamo bay masterminded the kidnapping of two chinese dam workers, one of whom was later shot to death when used as a human shield against pakistani commandos. ``another former detainee promptly resumed his post as a senior taliban commander and murdered a united nations engineer and three afghan soldiers. still another murdered an afghan judge. it was reported only last month that a released detainee carried out a suicide bombing against iraqi

to the `blind sheikh's' defense lawyers; that information was in the hands of osama bin laden within two weeks.'' justice scalia went on to write page after page, explaining the perils that the overzealous and underthinking majority of the court had imposed on the united states, on our military. justice scalia made clear, when it comes to war, the decision that the majority made was to basically tell our military: instead of protecting yourselves and protecting your brothers and sisters in arms, we are going to require you to go out there, gather up dna evidence, get blood evidence, maybe just drive a forensic wagon out there onto the field of battle. start gathering evidence because some moronic person in a palace in washington--``palace'' being what some of the justices who first went through the new supreme court building said about it back in 1935, that palace in which they reside--has said that, in a time of war, we have lost our mind in america, and we are going to now start putting our military at risk of their very lives so they can go gather up evidence to satisfy some bloated judge in a palace in washington. that is why he made the profound statement that he did in this dissent. {time} 2100 his words will almost certainly cause more americans to be killed. that is extraordinary. dear justice scalia finished the dissenting opinion by saying: ``today the court warps our constitution in a way that goes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the suspension clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable `functional' test for the extra territorial reach of habeas corpus (and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well). it blatantly misdescribes

man. what a brilliant man with extraordinary common sense. so, mr. speaker, my staff helped me. we have all been picking out favorite quotes that justice scalia has provided, both in written opinion and in speeches. one of justice scalia's statements was: ``never compromise your principles, unless, of course, your principles are adolph hitler's, in which case you would be well-advised to compromise them as much as you can.'' another statement by justice scalia was: ``more important than your obligation to follow your conscience, or at least prior to it, is your obligation to form your

legislation that does get out is good legislation.'' mr. speaker, it brings to mind a discussion i heard him have with some people from my district, some senior citizens that were coming to

gridlock. so they said: you know what? we don't want a parliamentarian system where the legislators elect a prime minister. no. we want an executive elected totally different from the legislature. so we will have him elected in a whole different way, and then he can stop any law they may try to pass. and that is not good enough. let's create another branch, the judiciary branch, and then they can nix anything that is passed. no, we are the most free nation in history because the founders didn't trust government and they made it as hard as possible to pass laws. mr. speaker, how much time do i have remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas has 7 minutes remaining. mr. gohmert. justice scalia says in one of his dissents: ``i have exceeded the speed limit on occasion.'' he said: ``a man who has no enemies is probably not a very good man.'' he said: ``if you read the rest of the section, you would say, to find a way to find a meaning that the language will bear that will uphold the constitutionality. you don't interpret a penalty to be a pig. it can't be a pig.'' he did know how to bring things back to tangible terms. he said: ``if you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. if you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.'' i've experienced that myself. there were times i disagreed with the law, but it was constitutionally made and passed, and i followed the law as a judge and chief justice. that is exactly what he did. in a dissent in 1996, justice scalia said: ``the court must be living in an another world. day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a constitution for a country i do not recognize.'' ten years later, in 2006, he says: ``so the question comes up, is there a constitutional right to have homosexual conduct? not a hard question for me. it's absolutely clear that nobody ever thought when the bill of rights was adopted that it gave a right to homosexual conduct. homosexual conduct was criminal for 200 years in every state. easy question.'' he made those statements in remarks at the university of fribourg, switzerland, back in 2006. in 2009, he said: ``the court today continues its quixotic quest to right all wrongs and repair all imperfections through the constitution. alas, the quest cannot succeed.'' he also said: ``this case, involving legal requirements of the content and labeling of meat products such as frankfurters affords a rare opportunity to explore simultaneously both parts of bismarck's aphorism that `no man should see how laws or sausages are made.''' he said: ``god has been very good to us. one of the reasons god has been good to us is that we have done him honor.'' certainly, justice scalia did god honor. a lot of people don't realize what a tenderhearted man he was as well. after the horrendous murder of justice michael luttig's father and the assault and attempted murder of his mother in their own garage, two streets over from my house, the family did not want to call michael and describe the horrors that had been inflicted on his father and mother. {time} 2115 middle of the night, justice scalia is in bed. justice scalia gets called, would he go out to michael luttig, judge luttig's house, and let him know in the wee hours of the morning that his father had been killed. justice scalia, for whom judge luttig had clerked, he knew michael luttig loved him. he put on his warmup suit and went out in the middle of the night many miles away because he cared. as i conclude, mr. speaker, i thought about the words of john quincy adams in the amistad case. he didn't think he had won the case. he was finishing. he was afraid he had not done an adequate job defending these africans who should be free and should be free to go where they wanted without chains, without bondage. so he finished his argument by saying, and this is john quincy adams, 1841, in the supreme court: ``as i cast my eyes along those seats of honor and public trust, now occupied by you, they seek in vain for one of those honored and honorable persons whose indulgence listened then to my voice. marshall, cushing, chase, washington, johnson, livingston, todd--where are they? where is that eloquent [[page h850]] statesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in the management of that cause, robert goodloe harper? where is that brilliant luminary, so long the pride of maryland and of the american bar, then my opposing counsel, luther martin? where is the excellent clerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of africa, as a monument of his abhorrence of the african slave trade elias b. caldwell? where is the marshal? where are the criers of the court? alas, where is one of the very judges of the court, arbiters of life and death, before whom i commenced the anxious argument, even now prematurely closed? where are they all? gone. gone. all gone. gone from the services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully rendered to their country. i humbly hope, and fondly trust, that they have gone to receive the rewards of blessedness on high.'' in taking, then, his final leave of the bar there at the supreme court, john quincy adams said he hoped that every member of the supreme court may go to his final account with as little of earthly frailty to answer for as those illustrious dead. and he said: ``that you may, every one, after the close of a long and virtuous career in this world, be received at the portals of the next with the approving sentence: `well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy lord.' '' mr. speaker, i have no doubt whatsoever that justice antonin scalia, my friend, our friend, the luminary of the supreme court, heard those words days ago: ``well done, good and faithful servant.'' mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",21890

Today we will consider the nomination of someone who I think can help lead the agency in a new direction. I recently met with Dr. Califf and raised my concerns and desire for the FDA to take a more assertive role in addressing this serious epidemic. He shared with me his proposed plan for dealing with the issue and for establishing a necessary cultural shift over the agency. I plan to support his nomination today, and I look forward to working with him. That said, I have proudly led many efforts over the years to push the FDA to take a stronger approach when it comes to ending today's prescription opioid epidemic. I don't plan to let up now.

Mr. President, we understand that in just a few minutes the President is set to make an announcement on the secure facility in Guantanamo. In light of that, colleagues should consider the following things we have heard in recent weeks. General Dunford has spoken of the need for our military to take more aggressive action against the ISIL group that is operating inside Libya. General Campbell has spoken of the need to retain a sizable enough force in Afghanistan to accomplish the dual missions of both conducting counterterrorism operations and training and advising the Afghan security forces. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has issued a budget request that seeks funding for the weapons systems and programs we will need to balance against the regional ambitions of China and Russia. In other words, some of the most senior national security officials within this administration are already working to better position the next President for the national security challenges we will face in 2017 and beyond. Yet President Obama seems to remain captured on one matter by a campaign promise he made in 2008--his ill-considered crusade to close the secure detention facility at Guantanamo. Today we received the descriptions of where the President would like to detain terrorists within the United States--though not any actual proposed locations--despite the fact that it would be illegal under current law to transfer foreign terrorists at Guantanamo into the United States. This isn't a case where the President can even try to justify the use of some pen-and-phone strategy by claiming Congress failed to act. To the contrary, Congress acted over and over again in a bipartisan way to reject the President's desire to transfer dangerous terrorists to communities in the United States. The President signed all these prohibitions and his Attorney General recently confirmed that it is illegal for the President to transfer any of these terrorists into the United States. We will review President Obama's plan, but since it includes bringing dangerous terrorists to facilities in U.S. communities, he should know that the bipartisan will of Congress has already been expressed against that proposal. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S925] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUANTANAMO DETAINEES Mr. McCONNELL.

Yet President Obama seems to remain captured on one matter by a campaign promise he made in 2008--his ill-considered crusade to close the secure detention facility at Guantanamo. Today we received the descriptions of where the President would like to detain terrorists within the United States--though not any actual proposed locations--despite the fact that it would be illegal under current law to transfer foreign terrorists at Guantanamo into the United States. This isn't a case where the President can even try to justify the use of some pen-and-phone strategy by claiming Congress failed to act. To the contrary, Congress acted over and over again in a bipartisan way to reject the President's desire to transfer dangerous terrorists to communities in the United States. The President signed all these prohibitions and his Attorney General recently confirmed that it is illegal for the President to transfer any of these terrorists into the United States. We will review President Obama's plan, but since it includes bringing dangerous terrorists to facilities in U.S. communities, he should know that the bipartisan will of Congress has already been expressed against that proposal. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,2450,2450,2521,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [senate] [page s925] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] guantanamo detainees mr. mcconnell. mr. president, we understand that in just a few minutes the president is set to make an announcement on the secure facility in guantanamo. in light of that, colleagues should consider the following things we have heard in recent weeks. general dunford has spoken of the need for our military to take more aggressive action against the isil group that is operating inside libya. general campbell has spoken of the need to retain a sizable enough force in afghanistan to accomplish the dual missions of both conducting counterterrorism operations and training and advising the afghan security forces. secretary of defense ash carter has issued a budget request that seeks funding for the weapons systems and programs we will need to balance against the regional ambitions of china and russia. in other words, some of the most senior national security officials within this administration are already working to better position the next president for the national security challenges we will face in 2017 and beyond. yet president obama seems to remain captured on one matter by a campaign promise he made in 2008--his ill-considered crusade to close the secure detention facility at guantanamo. today we received the descriptions of where the president would like to detain terrorists within the united states--though not any actual proposed locations--despite the fact that it would be illegal under current law to transfer foreign terrorists at guantanamo into the united states. this isn't a case where the president can even try to justify the use of some pen-and-phone strategy by claiming congress failed to act. to the contrary, congress acted over and over again in a bipartisan way to reject the president's desire to transfer dangerous terrorists to communities in the united states. the president signed all these prohibitions and his attorney general recently confirmed that it is illegal for the president to transfer any of these terrorists into the united states. we will review president obama's plan, but since it includes bringing dangerous terrorists to facilities in u.s. communities, he should know that the bipartisan will of congress has already been expressed against that proposal. ____________________",2450
CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS925-7,CREC-2016-02-23,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S925-S926] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the signs of the season are all around us. Volunteers are knocking on doors, [[Page S926]] caucusers are caucusing, voters are voting, and countless ballots have been cast already in places as diverse as Council Bluffs, Nashua, and Myrtle Beach. Thousands more Nevadans are making their voices heard today, and Americans in over a dozen more States will have an opportunity to do the same next week. It is campaign season. We are right in the middle of it, and one of the most important issues now is this: Who will Americans trust to nominate the next Supreme Court justice? The Presidential candidates are already debating the issue on stage. Americans are already discussing the issue among themselves, and voters are already casting ballots--in the case of the Democratic leader's constituents on this very day--with this issue very much in mind. One might say this is an almost unprecedented moment in the history of our country. It has been more than 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy arose and was filled in a Presidential election year, and that was when the Senate majority and the President were from the same political party. It has been 80 years. Since we have divided government today, it means we have to look back almost 130 years to the last time a nominee was confirmed in similar circumstances. That was back when politicians such as mugwumps were debating policy like free silver and a guy named Grover ran the country. Think about that. As Senators, it leaves us with a choice. Will we allow the people to continue deciding who will nominate the next Justice or will we empower a lameduck President to make that decision on his way out the door instead? The question of who decides has been contemplated by many, including our friends on the other side of the aisle. We already know the incoming Democratic leader's view. The senior Senator from New York didn't even wait until the final year of President George W. Bush's term to declare that the Senate ``should reverse the presumption of confirmation'' and ``not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except in extraordinary circumstances.'' We also know how the current Democratic leader feels about judicial nominees from a President of the other party. This is what he said: ``The Senate is not a rubberstamp for the executive branch,'' he said. ``Nowhere in [the Constitution] does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That's very different than saying every nominee receives a vote.'' What about the views of the top officer of this body, the President of the Senate? Joe Biden was a Senator for many decades. He was a loyal Democrat. He developed enduring friendships in both parties, and before becoming Vice President, he served here as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Let's consider what he said in circumstances similar to where we find ourselves today. It was an election year with campaigns already underway, a President and a Senate majority from different political parties, just as we have today. This is what appeared on page A25 of the Washington Post: Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has urged President Bush not to fill any vacancy that might open up on the Supreme Court until after the November election. Warning that any election-year nominee ``would become a victim'' of a ``power struggle'' over control of the Supreme Court, Biden said he would also urge the Senate not to hold hearings on a nomination if Bush decided to name someone. The article continued, quoting then-Senator Biden: ``If someone steps down, I would highly recommend the president not name someone, not send a name up,'' Biden said. ``If he [Bush] did send someone up, I would ask the Senate to seriously consider not having a hearing on that nominee.'' And then, this: ``Can you imagine dropping a nominee, after the three or four or five decisions that are about to [be] made by the Supreme Court, into that fight, into that cauldron in the middle of a presidential year?'' Biden went on. ``I believe there would be no bounds of propriety that would be honored by either side. . . . The environment within which such a hearing would be held would be so supercharged and so prone to be able to be distorted.'' ``Whomever the nominee was, good, bad or indifferent,'' he added, ``would become a victim.'' As the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, pointed out yesterday, Biden went even further on the Senate floor. He said that ``[it does not] matter how good a person is nominated by the President'' because it was the principle of the matter, not the person, that truly mattered. Biden cautioned that ``Some of our nation's most bitter and heated confirmation fights have come in presidential election years'' but also reminded colleagues of several instances when Presidents exercised restraint and withheld from making a nomination until after the election. One of them was Abraham Lincoln. It offers an example others may choose to consider. President Obama, like Lincoln, once served in the Illinois legislature. It is a place he returned to just the other day to talk about healing the divide in our country. He said: It's been noted often by pundits that the tone of our politics hasn't gotten better since I was inaugurated. In fact it's gotten worse. . . . One of my few regrets is my inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our politics. Well, this is his moment. He has every right to nominate someone, even if doing so will inevitably plunge our Nation into another bitter and unavoidable struggle. That certainly is his right. Even if he never expects that nominee to be actually confirmed but rather to wield as an election cudgel, he certainly has the right to do that. But he also has the right to make a different choice. He could let the people decide and make this an actual legacy-building moment, rather than just another campaign road show. Whatever he decides, his own Vice President and others remind us of an essential point. Presidents have a right to nominate just as the Senate has its constitutional right to provide or withhold consent. In this case, the Senate will withhold it. The Senate will appropriately revisit the matter after the American people finish making in November the decision they have already started making today. For now, I would ask colleagues to consider once more the words of Vice President Biden. He said: Some will criticize such a decision and say it was nothing more than an attempt to save the seat on the Court in the hopes that a . . . [member of my party] will be permitted to fill it, but that would not be our intention, Mr. President, if that were the course to choose in the Senate to not consider holding hearings until after the election. Instead, it would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over. That is Vice President Biden when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in a Presidential election year. Fair to the nominee, essential to the process, a pragmatic conclusion--the words of President Obama's own No. 2. What else needs to be said? ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S925-S926] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. McCONNELL.

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS927-2,CREC-2016-02-23,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S927-S928] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Republican leader is doing his best to try to make a good picture here as to why he has made the decision that the Senate is not going to confirm any Supreme Court nominee the President puts forward. I heard one statement by the former chair of the Judiciary Committee this morning saying it doesn't matter whom he puts up, we are not going to vote for him or her, whatever the case may be. But the facts my friend provides are absolutely distracting and they are wrong. He can read all the statements he wants from the senior Senator from New York and the Vice President, but never were any nominees held up. In fact, we don't have to go back to Grover, as he indicated, to find a similar situation. Let's talk about Ronald, a more recent President. In 1988, in the last year of his Presidency, President Reagan put forward the nomination of Anthony Kennedy to be a Supreme Court Justice. That was in the last year of his term. And what did we do? We took it up, and he was confirmed. There is a lot of time to do things. Vice President Biden's statement was made in the middle of the summer of the year he spoke, but there is so much time left. We have 333 days left in President Obama's term of office, so there is plenty of time to get the work done. The average number of days to confirm Justices is 67 days, so I think we should be able to squeeze 67 days out of 333 days. I don't want to burden everyone with facts, but sometimes they can get in the way of some of these ridiculous diversions from what our job should be. When Senator Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1991 and 1992 during George W. Bush's term, we confirmed 120 judges. Certainly that hasn't been the case in the last few years because Republicans basically have opposed all judges. And now this new direction toward making sure there is no confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is obstruction on steroids. This is really a pivotal moment for the Republican Party and this Republican Senate. The Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt is transforming before our eyes, abandoning its last vestiges of decency and rationality and unconditionally surrendering its moral compass to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Gone are the days of levelheadedness and compromise. The radicals in the Republican Party have turned ``bipartisanship'' into a dirty word. Behind closed doors, my Republican colleagues like to express disappointment at the direction the party is taking, but never, never will they say anything publicly because the extreme elements in their party who seem to be running the party will criticize them. Republicans should think long and hard about this simple fact: If they follow the course set by the Republican leader, every one of them will be as responsible as Trump and Cruz in the debasement of the Republican Party. He will join them in what they have done to the party. It will be a new and much worse Republican Party. Clearly, Senator McConnell is absolutely following the lead of extremists Trump and Cruz. There is no clearer example of this than the Republican leader's response to the Supreme Court vacancy. In the aftermath of Justice Scalia's passing, the senior Senator from Kentucky could have announced his intent to fulfill the Senate's constitutional responsibility and invited the President to send a well-qualified candidate to the Senate for confirmation. But that is not what he did because that is not the party of Trump. Instead, the Republican leader announced that he will deny President Obama his constitutional right to appoint nominees to the Supreme Court, defying all precedent that has been set, and by so doing, he will leave the Supreme Court in a state of uncertainty. Senator McConnell is leading a charge to obstruct and cheapen the Presidency at all costs, regardless of the damage it does to our democracy. Doesn't that sound familiar? Sounds like something Donald Trump would do. That is because it is exactly what Donald Trump urged Senator McConnell to do. At a Republican Presidential debate in South Carolina 10 days ago, Mr. Trump said of the Supreme Court vacancy: I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop [the nomination]. It's called delay, delay, delay. That is from Donald Trump, and that is exactly what the Republican leader is doing--delay, delay, delay. I believe 333 days is enough to do the work we ordinarily do in 67 days. It is disappointing that the Senator from Kentucky takes his marching orders from extremists such as Donald Trump. It is a pretty stark change from what Senator McConnell used to believe. He used to loathe this radical tea party faction of the Republican Party. According to an account in the New York Times, the Republican leader once referred to the tea party Republicans as ``those idiots, those people come up here and have never been in office and know nothing about being in office.'' Yet, today, he is meeting with those same Republicans. He is meeting with the House Freedom Caucus--the same Republicans who worked with Ted Cruz to shut down the government. And they did shut it down. It seems as though the Republican leader now subscribes to this new, radical Republicanism. Even though this extremist brand of politics may sell in Republican Presidential primaries, mainstream Americans categorically reject it. Yesterday, Public Policy Polling released a survey of Independent voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio--not Democrats, not Republicans, but a large swath of Americans who are now Independents. These numbers should serve as a wake-up call to the Republican leader's party: 70 percent of Independent voters in Ohio believe a new Supreme Court Justice should be named this year. More than 60 percent of Independent voters in Pennsylvania believe a new Supreme Court Justice should be named this year. The American people are telling Republicans in the Senate that they reject this obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee. Unfortunately, the Republican leader is listening to Donald Trump and the junior Senator from Texas. He is not listening to mainstream America. He is not listening to the few voices of reason coming from his own party, even from his own Senators. Yesterday the senior Senator from Maine, a Republican, told CNN: For my part, it's clear the President can send up a nominee--regardless of where he is before he leaves office. It is the duty of the Senate, under the Constitution, to give our advice and consent or withhold our consent. I believe we should follow the regular order and give careful consideration to any nominee that the President may send to the Senate. There is precedent in this body. Even in the Judiciary Committee, if there is a hearing held and the person is not reported out with a majority vote, it comes to the floor anyway. Senator Leahy--longtime chair of the Judiciary Committee, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and now ranking member of the Judiciary Committee-- [[Page S928]] will come and talk about that this morning. I just read a quote from Senator Collins, but she is not alone in urging the Republican leader to follow regular order. Other sitting Senators are saying the same thing. I will not read what all of them say, but there is a small nucleus of Republican Senators who believe strongly that what Senator McConnell is doing is wrong. The Republican Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, was quoted in one interview as saying: If the President nominates someone, which is his choice, I think that person would deserve a hearing if that person is not someone that is just obviously nominated for political purposes. Even the Republican leader's former colleagues agree that the President's nominee deserves a fair shake. The former Senator from Indiana, Dick Lugar, is urging Senate Republicans to do the right thing and honor their constitutional duty. He served here for more than three decades. Here is what he said yesterday: I can't understand their reluctance given the controversy that surrounds all of the debate that has already occurred. But that is not sufficient reason to forgo your duty. But perhaps the former Republican Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, said it best: I believe that the process should go forward and be given a good-faith effort. ``A good-faith effort''--it is a phrase we hear often, but it is absolutely crucial to American democracy. Our Constitution is constructed with the expectation that elected leaders would act in good faith. That is how our government operates. It should. Under the Republican obstruction, that has not been the case. I ask my Republican colleagues, whose side do you want to be on? Whose voice are you listening to? These voices of moderation and reason coming from within your own party or the shrill voices--the shrill, shrill voices--of Trump and Cruz? There isn't time to vacillate. Right now, before our eyes, the Republican leader is leading this conference straight to the side of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. It is not too late to change course. Reject the extremist approach being propagated by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. It will only hurt our country. Put aside this unprecedented obstruction and work with President Obama to fill this crucial vacancy on the Supreme Court. Do your job. All we are saying is: Do your job. Do your job. Do your job. Will the Chair announce the schedule for the rest of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S927-S928] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID.

More than 60 percent of Independent voters in Pennsylvania believe a new Supreme Court Justice should be named this year. The American people are telling Republicans in the Senate that they reject this obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee. Unfortunately, the Republican leader is listening to Donald Trump and the junior Senator from Texas. He is not listening to mainstream America. He is not listening to the few voices of reason coming from his own party, even from his own Senators. Yesterday the senior Senator from Maine, a Republican, told CNN: For my part, it's clear the President can send up a nominee--regardless of where he is before he leaves office. It is the duty of the Senate, under the Constitution, to give our advice and consent or withhold our consent. I believe we should follow the regular order and give careful consideration to any nominee that the President may send to the Senate. There is precedent in this body. Even in the Judiciary Committee, if there is a hearing held and the person is not reported out with a majority vote, it comes to the floor anyway. Senator Leahy--longtime chair of the Judiciary Committee, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and now ranking member of the Judiciary Committee-- [[Page S928]] will come and talk about that this morning. I just read a quote from Senator Collins, but she is not alone in urging the Republican leader to follow regular order. Other sitting Senators are saying the same thing. I will not read what all of them say, but there is a small nucleus of Republican Senators who believe strongly that what Senator McConnell is doing is wrong. The Republican Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, was quoted in one interview as saying: If the President nominates someone, which is his choice, I think that person would deserve a hearing if that person is not someone that is just obviously nominated for political purposes. Even the Republican leader's former colleagues agree that the President's nominee deserves a fair shake. The former Senator from Indiana, Dick Lugar, is urging Senate Republicans to do the right thing and honor their constitutional duty. He served here for more than three decades. Here is what he said yesterday: I can't understand their reluctance given the controversy that surrounds all of the debate that has already occurred. But that is not sufficient reason to forgo your duty. But perhaps the former Republican Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, said it best: I believe that the process should go forward and be given a good-faith effort. ``A good-faith effort''--it is a phrase we hear often, but it is absolutely crucial to American democracy. Our Constitution is constructed with the expectation that elected leaders would act in good faith. That is how our government operates. It should. Under the Republican obstruction, that has not been the case. I ask my Republican colleagues, whose side do you want to be on? Whose voice are you listening to? These voices of moderation and reason coming from within your own party or the shrill voices--the shrill, shrill voices--of Trump and Cruz? There isn't time to vacillate. Right now, before our eyes, the Republican leader is leading this conference straight to the side of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. It is not too late to change course. Reject the extremist approach being propagated by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. It will only hurt our country. Put aside this unprecedented obstruction and work with President Obama to fill this crucial vacancy on the Supreme Court. Do your job. All we are saying is: Do your job. Do your job. Do your job. Will the Chair announce the schedule for the rest of the day. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,9685,9685,9756,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [senate] [pages s927-s928] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] filling the supreme court vacancy mr. reid. mr. president, i know the republican leader is doing his best to try to make a good picture here as to why he has made the decision that the senate is not going to confirm any supreme court nominee the president puts forward. i heard one statement by the former chair of the judiciary committee this morning saying it doesn't matter whom he puts up, we are not going to vote for him or her, whatever the case may be. but the facts my friend provides are absolutely distracting and they are wrong. he can read all the statements he wants from the senior senator from new york and the vice president, but never were any nominees held up. in fact, we don't have to go back to grover, as he indicated, to find a similar situation. let's talk about ronald, a more recent president. in 1988, in the last year of his presidency, president reagan put forward the nomination of anthony kennedy to be a supreme court justice. that was in the last year of his term. and what did we do? we took it up, and he was confirmed. there is a lot of time to do things. vice president biden's statement was made in the middle of the summer of the year he spoke, but there is so much time left. we have 333 days left in president obama's term of office, so there is plenty of time to get the work done. the average number of days to confirm justices is 67 days, so i think we should be able to squeeze 67 days out of 333 days. i don't want to burden everyone with facts, but sometimes they can get in the way of some of these ridiculous diversions from what our job should be. when senator biden was chairman of the judiciary committee in 1991 and 1992 during george w. bush's term, we confirmed 120 judges. certainly that hasn't been the case in the last few years because republicans basically have opposed all judges. and now this new direction toward making sure there is no confirmation of a supreme court justice is obstruction on steroids. this is really a pivotal moment for the republican party and this republican senate. the republican party of abraham lincoln and theodore roosevelt is transforming before our eyes, abandoning its last vestiges of decency and rationality and unconditionally surrendering its moral compass to donald trump and ted cruz. gone are the days of levelheadedness and compromise. the radicals in the republican party have turned ``bipartisanship'' into a dirty word. behind closed doors, my republican colleagues like to express disappointment at the direction the party is taking, but never, never will they say anything publicly because the extreme elements in their party who seem to be running the party will criticize them. republicans should think long and hard about this simple fact: if they follow the course set by the republican leader, every one of them will be as responsible as trump and cruz in the debasement of the republican party. he will join them in what they have done to the party. it will be a new and much worse republican party. clearly, senator mcconnell is absolutely following the lead of extremists trump and cruz. there is no clearer example of this than the republican leader's response to the supreme court vacancy. in the aftermath of justice scalia's passing, the senior senator from kentucky could have announced his intent to fulfill the senate's constitutional responsibility and invited the president to send a well-qualified candidate to the senate for confirmation. but that is not what he did because that is not the party of trump. instead, the republican leader announced that he will deny president obama his constitutional right to appoint nominees to the supreme court, defying all precedent that has been set, and by so doing, he will leave the supreme court in a state of uncertainty. senator mcconnell is leading a charge to obstruct and cheapen the presidency at all costs, regardless of the damage it does to our democracy. doesn't that sound familiar? sounds like something donald trump would do. that is because it is exactly what donald trump urged senator mcconnell to do. at a republican presidential debate in south carolina 10 days ago, mr. trump said of the supreme court vacancy: i think it's up to mitch mcconnell and everybody else to stop [the nomination]. it's called delay, delay, delay. that is from donald trump, and that is exactly what the republican leader is doing--delay, delay, delay. i believe 333 days is enough to do the work we ordinarily do in 67 days. it is disappointing that the senator from kentucky takes his marching orders from extremists such as donald trump. it is a pretty stark change from what senator mcconnell used to believe. he used to loathe this radical tea party faction of the republican party. according to an account in the new york times, the republican leader once referred to the tea party republicans as ``those idiots, those people come up here and have never been in office and know nothing about being in office.'' yet, today, he is meeting with those same republicans. he is meeting with the house freedom caucus--the same republicans who worked with ted cruz to shut down the government. and they did shut it down. it seems as though the republican leader now subscribes to this new, radical republicanism. even though this extremist brand of politics may sell in republican presidential primaries, mainstream americans categorically reject it. yesterday, public policy polling released a survey of independent voters in pennsylvania and ohio--not democrats, not republicans, but a large swath of americans who are now independents. these numbers should serve as a wake-up call to the republican leader's party: 70 percent of independent voters in ohio believe a new supreme court justice should be named this year. more than 60 percent of independent voters in pennsylvania believe a new supreme court justice should be named this year. the american people are telling republicans in the senate that they reject this obstruction of a supreme court nominee. unfortunately, the republican leader is listening to donald trump and the junior senator from texas. he is not listening to mainstream america. he is not listening to the few voices of reason coming from his own party, even from his own senators. yesterday the senior senator from maine, a republican, told cnn: for my part, it's clear the president can send up a nominee--regardless of where he is before he leaves office. it is the duty of the senate, under the constitution, to give our advice and consent or withhold our consent. i believe we should follow the regular order and give careful consideration to any nominee that the president may send to the senate. there is precedent in this body. even in the judiciary committee, if there is a hearing held and the person is not reported out with a majority vote, it comes to the floor anyway. senator leahy--longtime chair of the judiciary committee, the president pro tempore of the senate, and now ranking member of the judiciary committee-- [[page s928]] will come and talk about that this morning. i just read a quote from senator collins, but she is not alone in urging the republican leader to follow regular order. other sitting senators are saying the same thing. i will not read what all of them say, but there is a small nucleus of republican senators who believe strongly that what senator mcconnell is doing is wrong. the republican senator from indiana, senator coats, was quoted in one interview as saying: if the president nominates someone, which is his choice, i think that person would deserve a hearing if that person is not someone that is just obviously nominated for political purposes. even the republican leader's former colleagues agree that the president's nominee deserves a fair shake. the former senator from indiana, dick lugar, is urging senate republicans to do the right thing and honor their constitutional duty. he served here for more than three decades. here is what he said yesterday: i can't understand their reluctance given the controversy that surrounds all of the debate that has already occurred. but that is not sufficient reason to forgo your duty. but perhaps the former republican senator from maine, olympia snowe, said it best: i believe that the process should go forward and be given a good-faith effort. ``a good-faith effort''--it is a phrase we hear often, but it is absolutely crucial to american democracy. our constitution is constructed with the expectation that elected leaders would act in good faith. that is how our government operates. it should. under the republican obstruction, that has not been the case. i ask my republican colleagues, whose side do you want to be on?

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS928-3,CREC-2016-02-23,114,Nomination of Michael Missal (Executive Session),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S928-S929] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Nomination of Michael Missal Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is quite a discussion when we talk about confirmations, one of the responsibilities this body has that the other body does not have. In the case of a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy, however, during an election year, I think it has actually been some 80 years since they have actually filled a vacancy as opposed to waiting until after the next election. I am concerned today, though, about another confirmation. VA IG nominee Michael Missal has been nominated, and I have a hold. To explain what that means, when you have a hold, that doesn't necessarily mean you don't approve of the nominee, but it does mean there is one reason or another you don't want to go ahead and confirm that person. That happened in the case of the nominee to be a VA inspector general, Michael Missal. Actually, I am not placing a hold on him because of deficiencies in him but deficiencies in the Office of the Inspector General. Today what I am announcing is that I am lifting that hold. That means they are free to go ahead and have this nominee go forward, and I think that is the right thing to do. At the Muskogee VA facility alone, the IG office has conducted nine investigations since 2009, and there has been little or no change in the quality of care. Right now, my office is working hundreds of cases of Oklahoma veterans facing inadequate care or blocked access to benefits. I wrote the VA IG in January of 2016 simply requesting that the VA IG--inspector general--visit Oklahoma facilities and to do so with an outside entity such as a joint commission. There is an attitude sometimes with individuals not wanting outside help, a kind of assumption that ``I don't need their help.'' Their response letter denied my request to conduct an investigation with a third party. It is time for our VA facilities in Oklahoma to be held to those same standards as private hospitals, and I believe it would take the aid of an outside group to make this happen because right now they are not meeting that quality. Since placing a hold on Mr. Missal, the IG office has committed to investigating Oklahoma's VA facilities with the oversight of an outside entity, and I have also had commitment from Michael Missal that he will do that. I appreciate their commitment, but our work to improve the care for Oklahoma veterans doesn't end there. Since the VA reform bill passed Congress this last summer--and it was a good bill--it is clear our facilities in Oklahoma have continued business as usual. I haven't seen any noticeable difference in the performance and treatment of our veterans since the passage and activation of that bill. I believe the impending investigations will show it is going to require a change in the management level to bring about lasting improvements for veterans care. That is why I, along with my junior Senator from Oklahoma James Lankford, introduced S. 2554, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act, on February 12. This legislation is critical to providing the best treatment for our country's veterans. Building upon the comprehensive plan of the 2014 VA reform bill, our legislation grants VA leadership at the regional level the authority to fire and demote staff working in these facilities. I think a lot of them thought the reform bill did that, but it didn't. We haven't been able to do it. It also allows directors of veterans regional chapters to contract with an outside entity to conduct investigations of their VA medical facilities. As I have worked to address the many concerns I have with Oklahoma's VA facilities, I have come to trust the leadership at the regional level. One individual who has come in is Ralph Gigliotti. He has done a great job. He doesn't have the authority to do what this bill would allow him to do. Not only were intermediate surgeries suspended due to what they have now uncovered, but also the chief of staff has been temporarily removed from his position. However, this process revealed that regional directors are not presently empowered to address staffing concerns in the facilities they oversee. We have seen this in the State of Oklahoma numerous times. Our legislation peels away the layers of bureaucracy and allows the directors and each of the regional areas to play a larger role with improving the VA system as a whole. As we all know, freedom isn't free. Many of our veterans have paid the prices with scars, some visible and some may go unseen such as post-traumatic stress disorder--PTSD--depression, and traumatic brain injuries. In my great State of Oklahoma, there are more than 37,000 military families and roughly 340,000 veterans that call our State home, attend our churches, and contribute to our communities. On behalf of Oklahoma, I say we are humbled by the immeasurable dedication of each and every one of them. I think it is the government's duty to honor the promises made to our veterans in return for their sacrifice. I urge our colleagues to remember that. I can remember when I was in the Army, commitments were made to me [[Page S929]] when a decision was made--actually, mine was not a decision because it was compulsory service at that time, which I think we ought to go back to. Anyway, I think this is going to be good, and this is going to give us the resources and the capability of correcting the problems as we see them. For that reason, I am lifting my hold on Mr. Michael Missal and his nomination will move forward. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

filled a vacancy as opposed to waiting until after the next election. i am concerned today, though, about another confirmation. va ig nominee michael missal has been nominated, and i have a hold. to explain what that means, when you have a hold, that doesn't necessarily mean you don't approve of the nominee, but it does mean there is one reason or another you don't want to go ahead and confirm that person. that happened in the case of the nominee to be a va inspector general, michael missal. actually, i am not placing a hold on him because of deficiencies in him but deficiencies in the office of the inspector general. today what i am announcing is that i am lifting that hold. that means they are free to go ahead and have this nominee go forward, and i think that is the right thing to do. at the muskogee va facility alone, the ig office has conducted nine investigations since 2009, and there has been little or no change in the quality of care. right now, my office is working hundreds of cases of oklahoma veterans facing inadequate care or blocked access to benefits. i wrote the va ig in january of 2016 simply requesting that the va ig--inspector general--visit oklahoma facilities and to do so with an outside entity such as a joint commission. there is an attitude sometimes with individuals not wanting outside help, a kind of assumption that ``i don't need their help.'' their response letter denied my request to conduct an investigation with a third party. it is time for our va facilities in oklahoma to be held to those same standards as private hospitals, and i believe it would take the aid of an outside group to make this happen because right now they are not meeting that quality. since placing a hold on mr. missal, the ig office has committed to investigating oklahoma's va facilities with the oversight of an outside entity, and i have also had commitment from michael missal that he will do that. i appreciate their commitment, but our work to improve the care for oklahoma veterans doesn't end there. since the va reform bill passed congress this last summer--and it was a good bill--it is clear our facilities in oklahoma have continued business as usual. i haven't seen any noticeable difference in the performance and treatment of our veterans since the passage and activation of that bill. i believe the impending investigations will show it is going to require a change in the management level to bring about lasting improvements for veterans care. that is why i, along with my junior senator from oklahoma james lankford, introduced s. 2554, the department of veterans affairs accountability act, on february 12. this legislation is critical to providing the best treatment for our country's veterans. building upon the comprehensive plan of the 2014 va reform bill, our legislation grants va leadership at the regional level the authority to fire and demote staff working in these facilities. i think a lot of them thought the reform bill did that, but it didn't. we haven't been able to do it. it also allows directors of veterans regional chapters to contract with an outside entity to conduct investigations of their va medical facilities. as i have worked to address the many concerns i have with oklahoma's va facilities, i have come to trust the leadership at the regional level. one individual who has come in is ralph gigliotti. he has done a great job. he doesn't have the authority to do what this bill would allow him to do. not only were intermediate surgeries suspended due to what they have now uncovered, but also the chief of staff has been temporarily removed from his position. however, this process revealed that regional directors are not presently empowered to address staffing concerns in the facilities they oversee. we have seen this in the state of oklahoma numerous times. our legislation peels away the layers of bureaucracy and allows the directors and each of the regional areas to play a larger role with improving the va system as a whole. as we all know, freedom isn't free. many of our veterans have paid the prices with scars, some visible and some may go unseen such as post-traumatic stress disorder--ptsd--depression, and traumatic brain injuries. in my great state of oklahoma, there are more than 37,000 military families and roughly 340,000 veterans that call our state home, attend our churches, and contribute to our communities. on behalf of oklahoma, i say we are humbled by the immeasurable dedication of each and every one of them. i think it is the government's duty to honor the promises made to our veterans in return for their sacrifice. i urge our colleagues to remember that. i can remember when i was in the army, commitments were made to me [[page s929]] when a decision was made--actually, mine was not a decision because it was compulsory service at that time, which i think we ought to go back to. anyway, i think this is going to be good, and this is going to give us the resources and the capability of correcting the problems as we see them. for that reason, i am lifting my hold on mr. michael missal and his nomination will move forward. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from vermont.",5757

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS929,CREC-2016-02-23,114,Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy (Executive Session),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S929-S937] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past weekend the Nation honored Justice Antonin Scalia, who was laid to rest after serving on the Supreme Court for nearly three decades. Marcelle and I were home in Vermont when we learned that Justice Scalia had passed. Frankly, we were stunned by the news. I did not often agree with Justice Scalia, but he was a brilliant jurist with a deep commitment to our country and to the Constitution, and we enjoyed his friendship for decades. He will be remembered as one of the most influential Justices in modern history. While his family and all should have had a chance to mourn his passing, I was shocked when, in the immediate wake of his death, Senate Republicans moved quickly to shut down the constitutionally mandated process to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court. Within hours of his death being announced, they declared they would oppose any effort to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice this year. I have served in this body longer than any Member here and I have heard some shocking things during that time, but I am surprised by the political crassness of these statements. Before a nominee had even been named, some Republicans reflexively decided to prematurely reject anyone--anyone--nominated by the President. This impulsive rush to judgment runs completely contrary to how this body has always treated nominees--always treated nominees--to the highest Court in the land. Republicans should not allow the hyper- partisan rhetoric of the campaign trail to trump one of the Senate's most important constitutional duties. I have talked to the President, and I know he will fulfill his constitutional duty. He will nominate an individual to bring the Supreme Court back to full strength, and of course he should. The President has already begun consulting with Members of both parties in Senate, but after a nomination has been made, we in the Senate should get to work and do our jobs--the jobs we were elected to do. I was all over my State of Vermont last week. The Vermonters I spoke with last week reflect Americans across the country who are tired of partisan political games that are chipping away at the foundation of our constitutional democracy. I heard this from both Republicans and Democrats in Vermont. As Oliver Goodenough, a law professor at Vermont Law School, wrote this weekend in the Rutland Herald, an extended Supreme Court vacancy caused by Senate inaction ``would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 21, 2016] Court Battle--Another Shutdown? (By Oliver R. Goodenough) Within hours of the announcement of Anton Scalia's death, one of our political parties was already trying to make points with the electorate about the process of picking his successor. At that evening's debate, the GOP presidential candidates advocated that the constitutional process should be suspended, either voluntarily by President Barack Obama or by purposeful inaction by the Senate. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, was just as speedy, trying to warn Obama off from acting on the mandate of Article II, Section 2, which charges the president with nominating a replacement for Justice Scalia and the Senate with providing its advice and consent on the president's choice. One can understand McConnell's disappointment. Appointments to the Supreme Court are for life, which means only resignation, impeachment or death will create a vacancy. In the somewhat ghoulish game of waiting for a slot on the closely divided Supreme Court to open up, the short-term expectations of mortality had been focused elsewhere--Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, in particular, has been a survivor of long-odds pancreatic cancer. So Republicans were brought up short by the death of a conservative hero, whose replacement could shift the balance of the court. The accidents of history will do that sometimes. The Constitution makes provision for what happens in such a case--in the kind of clear, unequivocal language that is the best target for Justice Scalia's vaunted originalism. The president nominates. The Senate, for its part, gives the qualifications of any nominee a serious vetting; it is not entitled to just ignore the nomination. Some reports have argued that such a course of process sabotage would create a ``constitutional crisis.'' This is probably an overstatement; it would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment. With nearly a year left in Obama's term, waiting for his successor to name the new justice in 2017 would remove the ninth voice from the court not just for the current yearly term but also for most of the following term as well, since the replacement would arrive in the spring and miss months of argument and deliberation. For the better part of a year, the vacancy would sit like a broken tooth in the operations of the court. Close cases would often end up tied, with the result that the lower court finding would remain the binding result. Not itself a disaster, but a result that the constitutional provisions for naming a successor are designed to avoid. The embarrassment of sabotage on judicial appointments actually already exists: Republicans in the Senate have effectively shut down the process of nominating new judges for the federal courts of appeal. The blockage isn't over qualifications--such considerations would be a proper exercise of the Senate's confirmation role, raised in committee and on the Senate floor Rather, the nominations are sitting in a limbo of inaction: It is simply a matter of not doing the job at all. This is the real crisis, a state of politics where Republicans in the House and Senate are willing to derail the processes of government to thwart the actions of President Obama, good, bad or indifferent. The most obvious example was the full shutdown of government. Limited shutdowns on matters like judicial appointments are parts of the same pattern. Of course, obstructionism is not just a Republican failing, and it can be present in both parties to some degree in the spicy stew of politics in our robust democracy. But the bottom-line commitment of all parties should be to maintaining a functioning government, structured and administered in accordance with the framework set out in our Constitution, even when it is not working to their advantage. Why is this so hard for at least some Republicans to buy into? Why the willingness, indeed eagerness, to bring down the house we all live in? The key is a widespread denial among Republicans of the legitimacy of the Obama presidency. This is partly related to the man himself--all the blather about his birth, his religion, etc. While many Americans find it a vindication that we can elect an African-American to our highest office, for some it is an impossibility which in turn justifies the most extreme forms of resistance. Race is our original sin as a country, and its legacy haunts us still. Republicans are also in denial over changes in the social and economic fabric of America. We are, as always, in the process of moving from what America has been to what it will be. Conservatives have a role to play, reminding us of the valuable parts of where we came from. Progressives have a role, recognizing the imperatives of the future and charting the paths of change toward positive outcomes. Politics is the sometimes rough and tumble playing field where the dialog on this goes forward. The intransigence of shutdowns, however, whether of the full government or a critical aspect like the nomination process, exceeds the boundaries of acceptable play and hurts us all. Obama needs to make a good faith nomination to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate majority need to review it in good faith. That is what the Constitution provides; that is what the country needs. Get on with it. Mr. LEAHY. We must not let that dysfunction infect the Supreme Court, an independent, coequal branch of government that was designed to be above politics. The next nominee to the Supreme Court deserves full and fair consideration by the Senate. This includes a timely hearing and then having an up-or-down vote. I am worried that even before President Obama took office, and ever since then--even after he was reelected by a 5 million-vote plurality-- there has been an unrelenting and cynical campaign by some hyper- partisans to delegitimize the President's authority. There were the birthers, and there have been and still are spurious slurs of all kinds. Outside of this body, the efforts to undermine President Obama's constitutional authority to fill this Supreme Court vacancy draws some of their vehemence and venom from these dark corners. But every one of us took an oath of office--every one of us--and we [[Page S930]] are sworn to uphold our constitutional duties. Let us not be intimidated and pressured to avoid our sworn duty. Let us act for the good of the American people and for the good of this great Nation. Some have justified their call for unprecedented obstruction by claiming it is because the American people need a voice. Give me a break. The American people have spoken--millions of Americans--and an overwhelming majority of Vermonters voted in record numbers in 2008 and again in 2012 to elect President Obama. In doing so, they granted him constitutional authorities for all 8 years of those two terms. A President isn't elected for 1 year or 2 years or 3 years. A President is elected for 4 years at a time. Just saying that President Obama is a ``lame duck'' President does not make it true. In fact, the next election is not until November. The American people expect those they elected to do their jobs for their entire term. That means both in the Senate and in the White House. They don't expect Senators to say: Well, we can't vote on anything this year because it is an election year. We will collect our full salary, but we are not going to vote on anything. The American people don't like that. It is rare that a vacancy in the Supreme Court arises during an election year, but it is just false to say Justices do not get confirmed in Presidential election years. More than a dozen Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in a Presidential election year. The Democrats led the Senate during President Reagan's final year in office, and we voted. President Reagan's nominee was confirmed by a Democratic-led Senate during the President's final year in office. He received a hearing and a confirmation vote. It would be the height of hypocrisy to say we shouldn't apply the same process with a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in control of the Senate. We can't say that we will follow our constitutional duties and do our work if we have a Democratic-controlled Senate and a Republican President but we can't do it if it is the other way around. Some Republican Senators have acknowledged that the next Supreme Court nominee should receive a fair hearing. But the process can't end there. I have served on the Judiciary Committee for 36 years. During my time on the committee, we have never refused to send a Supreme Court nominee to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. Even in those cases where a majority of the committee had opposed the nomination, we still reported the nominee to the full Senate. Once reported to the full Senate, every Supreme Court nominee has received an up-or-down confirmation vote during my 40 years in the Senate. We have to uphold this bipartisan tradition for the next Supreme Court nominee because so much is at stake. Merely holding a hearing without full committee process and a confirmation vote is insufficient for a Supreme Court nominee. It would be a charade, and it would be an avoidance of our constitutional duties. If Republicans refuse to uphold their constitutional responsibility to consider the next Supreme Court nominee, I believe it will harm our constitutional system of government. If they succeed in deliberately holding open a seat on the Supreme Court for more than a year, they will be intentionally disabling the Court's ability to fulfill its constitutional role, and Republicans will be harming the Supreme Court for more than a year. Justice Scalia once wrote that a Supreme Court of just eight Justices risked the possibility the Court ``will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.'' The legal issues before the Supreme Court are significant, and the importance of a single vote on the Court cannot be overstated. One vote on the Supreme Court decided landmark cases concerning our campaign finance laws, clean water and air policies, marriage equality, and voting rights. Americans deserve a fully functioning Supreme Court. I have traveled all over my State. I have traveled all over this country. I have talked to Republicans and Democrats alike. What I know about my fellow Americans that makes me so proud is that they show up for work and they do their jobs. Americans don't have the luxury of telling their bosses that instead of doing their job, they would rather delay, delay, delay. If they did, they would probably be fired. The U.S. Senate shouldn't tell the American people that we are not going to do our jobs; that we will delay, delay, delay. The stakes are too high. The American people actually expect us to show up for work and do our job. Let's get to work, do the job the American people sent us here to do. And we may want to reread our oath to uphold the Constitution. It requires no less. Mr. President, I don't see others on the floor about to speak. I will yield the floor when I do. We have allowed this whole process to become far too partisan. I am a lawyer, a former prosecutor. I have argued cases in the State court, Federal courts, Federal trial courts, and Federal appellate courts. When I have gone to the Federal courts, I have always thought that the beauty of this--whether Republican or Democratic nominees--is that I could get a fair hearing. I thought it was a great honor to go there. People come from other parts of the world, and they talk about our Federal judiciary as an example for them. I recall that when a country that had been under dictatorship changed to a more democratic form of government, some of their people came to my office and asked about our judicial system. They said: Is it true that in the United States of America, people can actually sue their government? I said: That is true. It happens all the time. They said: Well, is it true that sometimes the government loses? I said: It happens all the time. They said: Well, do you replace the judge when that happens? I said: No. They are independent. It was like a lightbulb went on. They realized how different we are. Think of the image we send to the rest of the world--as well as 300 million Americans--if we say: No, we are going to politicize the Supreme Court, the Court that is supposed to be the final arbiter on constitutional questions. Look at what it says to them if we say: Yes, we have time to take more recesses this year than I think the Senate ever has, that I can ever remember, but we don't have time to do the job we were elected to do, the job we are paid to do--have a hearing on and vote on a Supreme Court nominee. The American people have jobs. They can't pick and choose when they will bother to show up. They can't say ``I know this is what I am supposed to do in this job, but I don't feel like it'' or ``I have a partisan reason not to do it. I am going to sit this out. See me next year, and I may do my job.'' Nobody would accept that. But that is really what is happening. The Republican leadership is saying ``No, we want to sit this out. We don't want to do our work. We don't want to do our job. See us next year, and maybe we will then.'' That has never happened. It never happened during an election year. There have been at least a dozen Supreme Court vacancies during an election year, and a dozen times the Senate, no matter who was President, came together and handled the nominee and got them confirmed. Why did Senators do that in the past? Probably because they figured they had been elected, they were being paid by the American people, it was part of their job, and so they showed up and did their job. Are we now going to change what has been the precedent ever since the beginning of this country and say ``Oh, we are better than that. We don't have to do our job. Keep paying us, but we don't have to do our job even though we have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and do our job''? Even Justice Scalia said that would be wrong, that you shouldn't have an eight-member Supreme Court. And we don't. Let's actually show up and do the job we were elected to do, do the job we are paid to do. Let's do what every other American has to do. They have to show up for work. They have to do their jobs. They can't say ``I don't feel like it this year. I will see you next year. Oh, by the way, send me my paycheck.'' That is not the American way; it should not be the Senate way. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S931]] Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today first to praise and echo the words of the senior Senator from Vermont, our ranking member on Judiciary, in urging our Republican colleagues to give a fair and full consideration of a Supreme Court nominee. I particularly wish to praise my friend, the ranking member, for his eloquent remarks and for his leadership of the committee when he was chair and as ranking member. My friend from Vermont is absolutely right. Just as the President has a constitutional responsibility to name a nominee to the Court, the Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on that nominee. Frankly, it is the Senate's job to consider Supreme Court nominees, and the American people expect the Senate to do its job. We are telling Senate Republicans, America is telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. Plain and simple. My friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, should commit to holding hearings. The distinguished majority leader should commit to holding a vote. It has been a longstanding precedent of the Senate to consider Supreme Court nominees in a timely manner, even in election years: Justice Pitney in 1912; Brandeis and Clarke in 1916; Cardozo at a time when America was even more divided than now, 1932. In the middle of the Depression, the great election between Roosevelt and Hoover, they put in Cardozo in that last year. Murphy in 1940 and Kennedy in 1988 were confirmed. Justice Kennedy was confirmed in the last year of a Presidency with a Republican in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate. That is the mirror image and the most recent chance we have to compare how Democrats were acting, how Republicans were acting. All of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who were here voted that way. I know today our Republican colleagues point to what Senator Biden said. They have pointed to what Chairman Leahy said. They have pointed to what I and other Democrats have said. There are equal quotations that Senator McConnell, Senator Grassley, and others have said, each voicing a different view than maybe is being voiced today. But none of those were held up. You can have all the competing quotes you want; they amount to nothing. The American people are strong--Democrats and Republicans--in telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. The bottom line is very simple. To say that there will be no hearing, no vote, no consideration whatsoever even before a nominee is named to a vacancy, that is not doing your job; that is quitting before you start. Senator Leahy said it well. Imagine someone showing up at work. Imagine if an average American showed up at work and said: I am going to take a year off, but you still have to pay me. Your boss wouldn't stand for it. Well, our boss, the American people, will not stand for this because it will take over 300 days before a Supreme Court nominee is filled, at best. The kind of knee-jerk political obstruction the American people have grown so frustrated with in the Congress is what our Republican colleagues are saying. If Republicans truly respect the Constitution, they should follow it and consider a nomination from the sitting President rather than playing political games. Instead, they are once again threatening to bow to the most extreme rightwing voices and engage in the kind of political obstruction that brought us a 3-week government shutdown that cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and took $15 to $20 billion out of the economy. In 2013, after the hard right didn't get its way in its fight to undo the Affordable Care Act, they waged a war to shut down the government. Republican leaders listened. They probably knew it was wrong in their heads, but they listened. What happened? After 3 weeks with their tails between their legs, the leadership had to say we have to open up the government even though we haven't repealed the Affordable Care Act. The now-junior Senator from Texas had urged that course, and they were foolhardy to follow. The junior Senator from Texas is now urging the course of having no hearings and no votes. I tell my Republican colleagues--and to his credit, Senator McConnell said we have to get the Senate working again--that this is a foolhardy course, and it will not stand. It will not last because the American people are telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. Republicans say the American people should have a voice in choosing a Supreme Court Justice. Well, guess what. President Obama won reelection by a large margin in 2012. Many of the issues they bring up now were there then, such as security and the Affordable Care Act. There was a referendum on all these kinds of things. The people spoke loudly and clearly on November 6, 2012, when they elected the President to another 4-year term. That is 4 years, as called for in the Constitution, not 3 years, as some of my Republican friends like to say now. If Republicans get their way, we would have a 4-to-4 gridlocked Supreme Court for a year that would tie the Court and large parts of the country in knots. Let me say, if we have a tie in the Supreme Court decision, the decision has no Presidential value. You get gridlock and confusion. America doesn't want gridlock. They don't want gridlock on the floor of the Senate, they don't want gridlock on the floor of the House, and they don't want gridlock in the Supreme Court. The American people expect the Senate to do its job. They are tired of obstruction and ``my way or the highway'' politics. Again I say that our friend, the junior Senator from Texas, likes to quote the Constitution. He likes to walk around carrying the Constitution. That is great. I am all for that. I would like him to show me the lines in the Constitution that say in the last year of the President's term, he doesn't have the power or the right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice. Of course he does. Yet the Republican majority-- at least by its stance now--is taking away that right because they will not even have a hearing. Some people say: Well, they will just vote no after the hearing. Maybe yes, maybe no. I believe every Member has the right to vote no if they think the nominee is out of the mainstream, and I will be the first to admit mainstream is defined differently by different people. But hearings are amazing things. If the candidate is being open and honest, hearings help us to get to know the candidate better. Whatever one thinks of hearings, the last four nominees of the Supreme Court-- two under President Bush, two under President Obama--got bipartisan votes and passed. This idea of not having a vote is wrong. For the sake of our Constitution and for the sake of getting our country moving again, I urge and plead with my colleagues on the other side to do their job. That is what the American people want, plain and simple. It is time for the Senate to do its job. Once the President nominates someone, we need to have hearings with our Republican colleagues in a careful and thoughtful way. They don't have to rush a nominee through-- no dilatory tactics--and then there should be a vote. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia and Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on February 13 the Nation was shaken by the news that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away. Justice Scalia served on the Nation's highest Court for 29 years, and he was a major figure on the American legal landscape. Justice Scalia was described by Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit as ``the most influential justice of the last quarter century.'' Over the years I came to know Justice Scalia. He was a man of great intellect, good humor, and he was a very social person. We certainly disagreed on many fundamental issues, but even those who disagreed with Justice Scalia on legal matters still admired him as a person. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--no ideological ally of Justice Scalia-- wrote [[Page S932]] after his death, ``we were best buddies.'' She described him as ``a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit, with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh.'' Justice Ginsberg said she and Justice Scalia were ``different in our interpretation of written texts,'' but they were ``one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.'' I have great respect for the decades Justice Scalia spent in public service. My thoughts and prayers clearly go with his family. As surprised as I was by the news of Justice Scalia's passing, I was amazed at how quickly the Senate majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, issued a press release saying, ``this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.'' His statement came out within 90 minutes of the press report of the Justice passing. This statement clearly came at a time when most people reflected on the loss of the Supreme Court Justice, and just like that, the conversation shifted from the passing of an American legal giant to an attack on President Obama's authority to fill his vacancy on the Supreme Court. What does the Constitution tell us about filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court? There are very few oaths a person takes in their life. As Members of the Senate, we swear each time we are reelected to a new term to uphold and defend that Constitution. What does the Constitution say about a vacancy on the Supreme Court? If you go to article II, section 2, it is explicit and very simple. The President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court.'' The President, under the Constitution, has an express responsibility to submit to the Senate the nomination of a person who is qualified to serve on our Nation's highest Court. Then, of course, the Senate has a job to do: Give that nominee a fair hearing and a timely vote. This is our constitutional responsibility as U.S. Senators. This is what we have been elected to do. Aside from voting on a declaration of war, I believe there is no greater responsibility than voting on the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. I serve on the Judiciary Committee, and it has been my privilege and honor to consider the nominations of four of the current Supreme Court Justices. There is no question that we have the time remaining to meet our constitutional responsibility in a thoughtful and careful way. It is now February of 2016. We are almost a year away from January of 2017 when President Obama will officially leave office. The Republican leader would have us leave a seat on the Nation's highest Court vacant for at least 1 year. Not since the Civil War has the Senate taken longer than a year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, and it certainly shouldn't happen now. Usually it takes the Senate about 2 months to consider a Supreme Court nominee. Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said that on average it takes about 67 days. So we have more than enough time to do this in a thoughtful and responsible way. Even during Presidential election years, the Senate has routinely confirmed Supreme Court Justices. It has happened over a dozen times, most recently in 1988, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed by a 97-to-0 vote during President Reagan's final year in office. President Reagan--a Republican President about to leave office--submitted a name, Justice Kennedy, to the Supreme Court, and a Democratic-controlled Senate approved it with a vote of 97 to nothing. So to argue that this has never happened before is to ignore history, and even recent history. In the past, Senate Republican leaders have said that the confirmation process should move forward with as little time as a month before an election. Consider the Presidential election of 1968. On June 13 of that year, Chief Justice Earl Warren informed the President he wanted to step down. On June 26 of the election year, Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to become Chief Justice and nominated George Homer Thornberry to fill his seat. President Johnson had already announced he would not run again, but Senate Republican leaders did not call President Johnson a lame duck and question his right to put forward nominees. In fact, Senate Republican leader Everett Dirksen of my State of Illinois said on July 13 of that year, ``I find that term `lame duck' as applied to the President of the United States as an entirely improper and offensive term.'' Republican Senator Dirksen was referring to the lame duck status of President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat. The Senate gave the President's nominee a prompt hearing in the Judiciary Committee. As it turned out, the hearing uncovered a range of ethics concerns about Justice Fortas, and in late September and early October, Senate Republicans filibustered his nomination. Fortas subsequently withdrew. But on October 3--same election year, just a month before the election--the New York Times reported that ``Senator Dirksen said there was still time for the President to submit a new name and rush it through the Senate before the Congress adjourned.'' The Republican leader said that even with a month left, we should try to fill the vacant seat. This was a month before the Presidential election. Where are the leaders like Everett Dirksen in today's Republican Party, Senators who are willing to roll up their sleeves and get down to the work of considering the nominees on their merits so the Supreme Court can do its work? We have a constitutional responsibility, as does the President. Make no mistake--the Supreme Court needs a full complement of Justices on the bench. When the Court has an even number, as it does today, four to four, important cases are increasingly likely to end up in a tie vote. When that happens in a case, the ruling of the lower court stands and it is as if the Supreme Court never heard the case at all. Major legal and constitutional questions are constantly brought before the Court. When the Court is frozen at an even number of Justices, many of those questions go unresolved and millions of Americans who are impacted by these questions have to wait. That is not fair to the American people. That is why historically the Senate moved to fill vacancies of the Court. That is why so many Americans are troubled by Senate Republicans' call for a 1-year hiatus in filling the Supreme Court vacancy. Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said in an interview last week that she disagreed with the idea of waiting for the next President to appoint a new Justice. Justice O'Connor said, ``We need somebody there now to do the job. Let's get on with it.'' I agree with Justice O'Connor. When President Obama submits a nominee, which he will do in coming days, the Senate needs to do its job, its constitutional responsibility, and give that nominee a fair hearing and timely vote. My Republican colleagues can choose to vote for or against the nominee. That is their prerogative. They should not simply duck the vote. We were not elected to this job to ignore important issues; we were elected to cast votes on important issues. This is too important an issue to simply ignore. When it comes to giving the President's nominee a fair hearing, I certainly hope Senate Republicans don't adopt the Donald Trump position. When asked about the President's nomination, Mr. Trump, as he is wont to do, gave us a juicy quote. Here is what he said: ``I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it--it's called delay, delay, delay.'' I am sure the Senate Republicans were not happy with that statement by Trump, but he did speak for a number of people who believe that is the right strategy: stop the President from using his constitutional authority; stop the Senate from accepting its constitutional responsibility. I hope my Republican colleagues don't follow Mr. Trump's lead and try to stop President Obama's nominee through endless delays. No one is going to be fooled if Senate Republicans spend weeks haggling over unreasonable document requests or swamping the nominee with endless written questions. Mr. Trump has already made it clear that ``delay, delay, delay'' is simply a strategy to stop the seat from being filled. If Republicans delay in an effort to run out the clock, we will know it, and the American people will know it. The American people want us to act. They want us to accept our constitutional [[Page S933]] responsibility. It is time for us to get down to work and do our job. The Senate can't afford to sit on its hands for 1 year and leave the Supreme Court hanging in the balance. When President Obama names a nominee, I urge my Republican colleagues to give that person a fair hearing and timely vote. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING CHAIR. The Senator from New Hampshire. Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my serious concerns with the FDA's actions on opioid pain relievers and my concern that they have not sufficiently addressed what we are seeing as an epidemic in my home State of New Hampshire. The implications of prescribing opioids and ensuring that we take a very strong public health approach toward these pain relievers is important. I know my that my colleagues--Senators Markey, Manchin, and Blumenthal--have been on the floor previously to discuss the concerns they share about the FDA as well. I thank them for their leadership on this important issue. I think what is important to understand here is what we are facing when it comes to heroin, the drug deaths that are occurring in my home State of New Hampshire, the connection between people who are misusing prescription opioids and then becoming addicted to heroin, and the deadly use of a drug called fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. When we bring this all together, we have a situation with opioid abuse which includes painkiller abuse, heroin use, fentanyl abuse, and it is killing people in New Hampshire and across this country. Across this country, approximately 30,000 people died of heroin or prescription opioid overdoses in 2014. As we come to receive the 2015 numbers, unfortunately, if the experience is anything like my home State of New Hampshire, the numbers are going to be much larger than 30,000 because in New Hampshire, every corner of my State has been impacted by this. I had the privilege of serving as attorney general before I came to the Senate, and I dealt with many drug issues as attorney general. In fact, I had a drug task force that reported to me. We dealt with the surge of methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illegal drugs that certainly have caused addiction and people to struggle with addiction. Obviously, alcohol is also something people struggle with when it is misused, but I have never seen anything like this. I talk to my law enforcement officers and I talk to my first responders about what they are dealing with. In 2015, in New Hampshire, we had over 400 overdose deaths, and those 400 deaths were situations where there was a combination--many of them, hundreds of them--of heroin and/or fentanyl. And that was a dramatic increase over 2014. In 2014, we had 320 deaths. And by the way, that is a 60-percent increase from the year before. Unfortunately, this is not stopping. It is the single most important public health and safety issue facing the State of New Hampshire right now, but I know New Hampshire is not alone. Certainly working with my colleague Rob Portman from Ohio, I know this is hitting Ohio. Working with Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island, I know this is hitting Rhode Island. Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota--this is hitting so many different places in our country. That is why I know Senator Markey from Massachusetts is concerned about this and Senator Manchin from West Virginia, who was on the floor earlier. This is about our quality of life in this country and the ability for people to live full lives and about our public safety and about our children most of all. The headline from the Union Leader over this weekend: ``Fentanyl, other drugs suspected in three Manchester deaths.'' So we had three deaths in New Hampshire, in our largest city, within 24 hours, and those three deaths were from a combination of heroin and fentanyl. According to Assistant Fire Chief Daniel Goonan, in just 24 hours in Manchester, these overdoses claimed the lives of a 23-year-old man, a 29-year-old woman, and a 34-year-old man. That was in just a 24-hour period. In fact, what our first responders are seeing--I did a ride-along with the Manchester fire department. I was there less than an hour. We went to an overdose, and I saw the firefighters and their emergency personnel bring someone back to life using CPR and Narcan. If we did not have that drug, the over 400 we had in New Hampshire--I can't even tell you what the numbers would be, because not only did I do a ride- along with the Manchester fire department, I did one with the police, too, and we went to two overdoses in an hour and a half, and I saw them bring those individuals back to life. But lest we think this is something that happens on some other street or in some other neighborhood, I can assure you that this can happen to any family, and that is something we need to understand. That was really brought home for me from a wonderful family I met, Doug and Pam Griffin, who lost their beautiful daughter Courtney. They are wonderful people. I think about what our first responders are facing. This same article I just talked about, over the weekend--unbelievable. Twice the fire department in Manchester revived a woman who was 4 months pregnant, working on her in front of her young children. I will never forget the overdose I went to. The firefighters came into the room, and there was a young man on the ground. They administered the Narcan and brought him back. But do you know what was in the corner? A crib with a baby in it. The firefighter grabbed the baby and was bringing the baby over. The father was lying on the ground. So this is having a tremendous impact on not only those who are struggling with addiction but also their families and the children around them and the future generations. In this article, the assistant fire chief from Manchester basically said: It is more deadly than we have ever seen. So that is why I have been proud to work with my colleagues, proud to work with Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Klobuchar, and so many others on the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act. I thank the members of the Judiciary Committee for voting that important piece of legislation out of the committee, and I look forward to us taking that up on the floor. Right now pending on the floor, we have an important nomination for the FDA. That is why I come to the floor today, because if you look at what we are addressing here, we are concerned about heroin and fentanyl, but there is a very important connection for us to understand, unfortunately, and it is also why I have been such a strong supporter of prescription-monitoring programs. The opiates that are prescribed--SAMHSA has found that four out of five individuals who turned to heroin actually started with prescription opiates and misusing prescription opiates or overusing those and then transitioning to heroin because heroin is cheaper, unfortunately, on our streets. So it is very important that we have the FDA engaging on this issue very aggressively with our medical community, that the FDA take a prominent role in ensuring that what they are saying is, this is the appropriate use of prescription opiates. In my humble opinion, the FDA needs to take a much more aggressive role than it has in recommending the appropriate uses and engaging the medical community and the pharmaceutical community, very importantly, on this discussion, this public health crisis we are facing. We have come together as a body on this issue, and I think it is important that we have been working on this in a very bipartisan basis. But just to talk about the importance of the FDA and the leadership we need there, in 2013 we saw the FDA approve Zohydro--a powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation, and an abuse- deterrent formulation is important so that it will be used for its intended purpose and not chopped up or otherwise abused. Yet the FDA approves Zohydro--this powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation despite the fact that its own advisory committee voted against approving the drug by a vote of 11 to 2. I see Senator Markey coming to the floor, and I appreciate his leadership on this. One of the things that I know have troubled Senator Markey, Senator Manchin, and me as well is that last year the FDA approved OxyContin [[Page S934]] for use by children as young as 11, and when they did that, they did not have an advisory committee or use an advisory committee before taking that step. So I would say that I certainly appreciate that I had the opportunity to sit down with Secretary Burwell on this issue and learn more about the FDA's action plan that it issued, but unfortunately I believe the agency has to go further than it is going. The example I would use is the issuance of the recommendations for the children as young as 11 with OxyContin, without an advisory committee on something so important, seems--to me, it just doesn't pass the commonsense test. So I would recommend to the FDA, let's make sure we have an advisory committee look at this issue carefully and then reissue a recommendation, because to me it seems important that we have that guidance and the careful, thoughtful approach of the advisory committee. Of course, what troubles me is we hope they would take the advisory committee's recommendations, unlike what happened with Zohydro, unfortunately. So we need leadership right now in the FDA. I have concerns that we are not going to be in a position where we get the strongest leadership we can have. We have a nominee pending on the floor. These concerns are very important. I hope, if he is confirmed, he will be aggressive on this issue and that the FDA will take a stronger leadership role on opiates, understanding that they have a very important role when it comes to this public health concern. Right now I am not satisfied with where we are. I believe there is so much more we need to do. That is actually why yesterday I voted to not go forward with this nomination, because I haven't heard this clear statement, I haven't heard what the leadership plans are on this issue. While I appreciate some of the steps the Department of Health and Human Services has taken, those steps to me need to be very much strengthened. As I look at the FDA's action plan, it pledges to make the use of advisory committees more frequent, but it should require the use of advisory committees for all opioid pain relievers, not just when we decide we want to use it. This should be consistent, given that we unfortunately know that the data is there on the connection between misuse of opioid pain relievers and the connection to those who unfortunately then turn to heroin, with the deadly combination of fentanyl, which is killing people in this country. Again, I wish to thank Senator Markey for his leadership on this issue. There isn't a place I go in my State where I don't hear from a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a grandmother, a grandfather, a friend about someone who lost a loved one, lost someone they care about, because of heroin, opioids, fentanyl, the deadly combination that is killing people. We have an opportunity, not only with the important work in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to add more resources to address prevention, treatment, and support for our first responders but also the FDA has a very important role, and we need stronger leadership there and greater engagement of our medical community on the best prescribing practices for opioids. To me, this is an opportunity where I would like to see stronger leadership and I would like to hear a much more aggressive stance from this FDA. Of all the issues we struggle with, the things we disagree on in this body--heroin, fentanyl, they don't care whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, I can assure my colleagues, or an Independent or a Libertarian because these drugs are taking everyone's lives. So as I think about all the issues we can come together on, this is one about our public health, about our public safety, about our quality of life, and it requires all of our leadership. There is nothing partisan about this. I hope we will see stronger leadership from the FDA. I hope we as a body will build on what the Judiciary Committee did and bring to the floor the CARA bill that many of us have worked hard on and support each other's efforts to do all we can to end this public health crisis and ensure that none of us have to run into families of people in our State whom we represent who are losing people they love to heroin or fentanyl or misuse of opioid prescription drugs. This is devastating. I know we can make a difference. This is something we can make a difference on in this body. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to follow on with the discussion that Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire was bringing to the Senate floor. What she is saying is just so accurate in terms of the pervasive nature of this opioid-driven epidemic--pandemic--in the United States of America. It is time for us to come together in a bipartisan fashion to deal with what is now the great medical storm sweeping across this country. There has been a quadrupling of opioid-related deaths in just the last 14 years in our country. This is something that has to be understood. I heard Senator Ayotte mention it, but we can't say it enough: 80 percent of all people in the United States who die from heroin overdoses begin with prescription painkillers--opioids--that have been given to them by physicians. Let me say that again. Eighty percent of the people who die from heroin overdoses started on prescription pills. They got addicted to the prescription painkiller. It deals with the same receptors in the brain. It creates the same kind of need in the brain, and when people get addicted to prescription pain medicine, it is ultimately a very short to a product which is much less expensive--heroin--on the streets of the United States. This epidemic has to be dealt with and it has to be dealt with where it starts and it starts at the FDA. It starts at the Food and Drug Administration. It starts with the agency that approves these drugs for sale in the United States of America. Yes, the FDA stands for Food and Drug Administration, but over the last 20 years it really stands for ``Fostering Drug Addiction,'' and it has to end. This is why the nomination right now of Dr. Robert Califf to be the new head of the FDA gives us an opportunity to talk about this issue, to talk about where it all starts, how it began, and what we are going to have to do in this body to reverse this trend, which last year led to the deaths of 30,000 people in our country. Again, I say to my colleagues that between 2000 and 2014, the heroin overdose death rate has quadrupled in the United States of America. This is something that is recent. It is related to the FDA, and we have to now have an honest discussion about the role that agency is playing because we have become the ``United States of Oxy.'' We have become a nation of 5 percent of the world's population that consumes 80 percent of the prescription painkillers in the world. This overprescribing, this consumption of Oxy and Percocet, down the line has led to this epidemic, this contagion that is killing people on a daily basis in our country who otherwise would never have even contemplated using heroin or using any of these other more dangerous drugs. That is why we are here. That is why I am recommending a ``no'' vote on Dr. Robert Califf. The FDA has a chance to change its policies. Thus far, it is saying it will not change its policies. In 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers. That is enough for every single adult in America to have a bottle of these pills in their medicine cabinet. We should understand as we talk about this that the molecular composition of OxyContin is very similar to heroin. In fact, Oxycodone is the sole ingredient in OxyContin. OxyContin stands for oxycodone continuously in the bloodstream of the patient who is taking these pills. It creates this sense that you are able to deal with the pain. It creates this sense that you are being taken care of, but if it is not handled correctly over time, it then creates an addiction, and that addiction then leads to, once you are off these pills, to being out on the street buying the heroin or buying the Oxy you need in order to continue this habit. So we have to start to deal with the issue very realistically in terms of this pathway that has been created into the minds of millions of people all across this country. Thirteen hundred people died in Massachusetts in 2014, of the 30,000 people [[Page S935]] in our country, as a result of this issue. We have the FDA, going back to the year 1996, accepting the misrepresentation of the pharmaceutical company Purdue, which represented to the FDA that OxyContin, in its original formulation, was abuse deterrent, meaning that since it was time-released inside of the patient, that, therefore, it was abuse deterrent and it could be prescribed safely to people all across our country. Well, it turned out that not only was that a misrepresentation to the FDA, but Purdue Pharma subsequently was fined millions of dollars and its executives punished for the misrepresentation they made to the Food and Drug Administration. That was a brief 20 years ago, but that is pretty much where it all started. That is the original sin--accepting this whole notion of abuse deterrent. Let's go to the FDA in more recent times. In 2012, there was a new opioid that the FDA had to consider for approval. That new opioid's name is Zohydro. The FDA impaneled 13 experts to examine that drug for the FDA. When those 13 experts concluded their examination of the drug by an 11-to-2 vote, the expert advisory panel voted, no, do not allow this new Zohydro drug out on to the marketplace. They said the standards for abuse are too low. The standards to deal with addiction are too low. The standards to deal with a diversion of the drug are too low. What did the FDA do in 2012? It approved Zohydro for sale in the United States over the objections of the advisory panel that had voted 11 to 2 against it--and these are experts. Moving forward, the FDA decided to reexamine what it was going to do. So when it was considering Targiniq, when it was considering Hysinla, it decided to solve the problem by having no expert advisory panels which it would convene to examine the impacts of that drug before it got approved. That is a good way to solve the problem--just accept the representations of the company that it had abuse deterrent in it, and then you don't have to worry because you will not have to talk to experts on the outside again. So those two drugs got approved. Then, in August of 2015, there was an application by Purdue Pharma, once again--that company's name just keeps coming back into the equation--they wanted approval to sell OxyContin to children ages 11 to 16. Now mind you, the actual standards at the FDA require an outside expert panel to look at approval for opioids being sold in America if it is controversial, if it could have a huge social impact in our society. And it specifically says in the FDA's own guidelines that if pediatric doses--if the proper dose for a child is involved--then the FDA should have an expert panel. What did the FDA do? The FDA decided no expert panel would examine the appropriateness of OxyContin being prescribed for children ages 11 to 16 in our country--no expert advisory panel, which brings us to the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf. We are now in a process where we are examining his nomination and his qualifications. This Senator leaves aside his own personal qualifications. This is not a debate, really, over Dr. Califf. It is a debate over the agency because the agency is saying--even today as we will be voting on Dr. Califf's nomination--they will not change. They will not convene expert outside advisory panels to look at this new generation of opioids with abuse deterrents built into them to determine whether or not they are actually appropriately being put into our society. Today is the day to begin this debate. This nomination is the occasion that we can use in order to debate what has gone wrong at the Food and Drug Administration. If we don't start with a brandnew definition that gets created for abuse, for addiction, for what the standards should be for the use of these opioids, then this issue is just going to escalate until we are losing a Vietnam war's number of people every single year in the United States. This is a pharmaceutical industry-created problem. This is a physician-created problem. This is an FDA-created problem. It is created by men and women, and it can be solved by men and women. This is not Zika, this is not Ebola, and this is not some disease that you can't really point to that is responsible. This is us, this is our country, and this is our culture. We did it. We created this problem. We are 5 percent of the world's population consuming 80 percent of all opioids--crazy. Really, it is crazy. We have to finally come to the recognition that this is no longer some inner city heroin epidemic. This disease knows no barrier--racial, income, geography, employment--no barriers at all. It is spread across every single segment of the American population, top to bottom. There is no discrimination whatsoever. We have to decide what we are going to do in order to make sure that we put the proper safeguards in place. Senator Manchin and I, Senators Ayotte, Sanders, Blumenthal, and others have been raising these questions. To the credit of the Senate Judiciary Committee, they are considering legislation to bring to the floor. I thank Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Shaheen, Ayotte, and Senators Grassley and Leahy for their work on that legislation, but that legislation does not conclude anything on this issue that I am talking about right now. This has to be solved by the FDA. That is why this Senator has put a hold on this nomination, saying that they will not get this nomination until they change their policies. We are in the eighth year of this administration, and the policies still remain in place. Abuse deterrent is really a contradiction in terms. If you take these pills--you are a carpenter or an ironworker, and you have a bad back-- you start taking these OxyContin pills right now, and you take them as they are prescribed, and you keep going month after month after month. You are increasing the likelihood on a daily basis that you are going to become addicted to these pills. We have heard these stories over and over again about the pathway in from family members. They come into the office and talk about the pathway in that their child, husband, or son took. It all starts with the same story. They were given the prescribed pills. Right now the industry is saying: Don't worry; there is an abuse deterrent. Tell that to these family members. Tell that to the families who have lost their loved ones. The drugs are not abuse deterrent. It is a contradiction in terms, like jumbo shrimp. There is no such thing. You need to be realistic about what this drug represents once it is consumed over and over again by people in our country who think that because the doctor has given them a bottle of pills, that is going to help them. That is one of the stories we hear over and over again from family members. They say that they question themselves. Could they have done more themselves to help their family member before they became addicted? The common theme from each of them is that you have to assume, when a doctor is giving you a bottle of pills for your family member, that it must be good for them. It must be good for them. It turns out that for 30,000 people in 2014, it wasn't good for them. This number is going to continue to escalate because we haven't put tough enough standards on the books in order to deal with these issues. By refusing to convene expert advisory boards to come in and to create the guidance which is going to be needed in our country going forward, we are going to have a continued flood of opioid deaths that could have been stemmed if we had dealt with this issue in the proper fashion. This is not a hypothetical concern. The policy announced last week by the FDA would not have guaranteed an advisory panel for OxyContin on the market today. The FDA must change its decision not to seek expert advice against the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids. I want to tell a little story. It is a story about one of maybe the five greatest basketball players ever to come out of the State of Massachusetts. His name is Chris Herren. Chris became a Boston Celtic. He was the greatest basketball player in Fall River history, was drafted in the first round by the NBA, and went to the same college I went to--Boston College. In an excerpt of remarks he recently made in DC at the Unite to Face Addiction rally on the National Mall, here is what Chris Herren said: [[Page S936]] I truly believe when it comes to prevention and educating our kids, we need to stop focusing on the worst days and start educating about the first day. At 18 years old, on the campus of Boston College I was introduced to cocaine. I promised myself one time--just one line. That one line took me 14 years to walk away from. Despite myself at 22, my dream came true. I was 33rd pick in the NBA draft, but that same year I was introduced to a little yellow pill--a 40 milligram OxyContin that cost a 20 dollar bill. That 40 milligrams turned into 1600 milligrams a day. And that 20 dollars became a $20,000-a-month Oxy habit. And just 2 years later, that pill turned into a needle and that needle stayed in my arm for the next 8 years. I often say if you can't find it in your heart to have empathy for someone who is battling their illness, then you must know that he or she has a mother, father, son or daughter that is at home with a broken heart that wants them back. Just one pill, lives impacted, some recover and many are lost. Another story--Kaitlyn Oberle from Scituate, MA. Here is what she says: I have survived a fatal opiate overdose, yet I never abused opiates. On November 13, 2015 I spoke to my 27-year-old brother for the last time. Less than 30 minutes after our final conversation, he passed away from an opiate overdose. He was only 16 years old when he first encountered the demon that consumed the better part of his adult life; sadly, that same demon ultimately killed him. Injuries from a dirt bike accident left him with two broken arms, a knee injury, and what felt like an unending supply of prescription opiate painkillers. After his bones mended, he was left with an untreated gaping open wound that would never fully heal itself: an opiate addiction. During my brother's recovery he painted a picture for me of how easy it was for him as a high school teenager and student athlete to call his doctor and request refills for his pain pill prescriptions. When he no longer had injuries to substantiate a prescription, he turned to illegal forms of opiates in both pill and intravenous form. Unfortunately, the damage to his brain had been done. There are many facets to what may cause someone to become addicted to opiates, and there are equally as many angles of attack before there is substantial progress to a viable solution. Mr. Senator, I am writing to you because I am a survivor. I've lived through my worst fear by knowing I can be a voice in helping prevent future deaths caused by opiate addiction. As you convene to debate the fitness of Dr. Robert Califf's nomination for head of the Food and Drug Administration, please ask the Senate to reflect on his time as deputy commissioner. As second in power at the FDA, he has had a chance to do something about these issues. It is time for a change in culture at that agency. A third letter--final letter written by Stephen Jesi, from Malden, MA: I am writing to you as a longtime Maldonian and a father of a 33-year-old daughter Stephenie who passed away on December 13, 2015 of a heroin overdose. Stephenie overdosed on Thursday, two days prior to her death and was released by the hospital at 11:39 p.m. on to the streets. We've experienced this first hand many times. Thank God for Chief Campanello of the Gloucester Police Department who picked up the phone, talked to us, talked to Stephenie, and assisted us in every way he could to get her into treatment. Everybody else just said sorry, there is nothing we can do. I believe that our medical community along with the pharmaceutical industry are grooming and developing drug addicts and putting them right into the hands of the cartels and the drug dealers. Way too many prescriptions are written for more narcotics than are necessary after surgeries with no follow up. Many of those who are predisposed to addiction, either by genetics or co-existing mental health issues, are easy prey for these drugs that begin as legally prescribed. Once they are addicted and can no longer afford the medically prescribed version of the medication they fall into illegal drugs and from there too often the addiction has taken control of their lives. The pharmaceutical industry along with our medical community has to prescribe these highly addictive narcotics much more carefully and offer less addictive medication whenever possible. Most patients take these narcotics for just a couple of days after the surgery but are provided a much longer supply where they can easily fall into the hands of the addict. Our legislators and government officials cannot be tied to the desires of the pharmaceutical lobbyists. This is the cry that is coming out from every community in America. Individuals are saying: How did this happen to my family? How could that accident with the broken leg or the back pain turn into an opioid overdose? How could it have happened? Well, it happened because the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry have not put the protections in place for us to be able to deal with it. Let me give you this number. This is a crazy number. It is a crazy number. Over the last 15, 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of prescription opioid pills that have been allowed to be sold in America. So I am just going to ask people who are listening to this, pick a number. How many 10 milligram prescription opioids were allowed to be made in America last year? Just pick a number. We have 300 million people in America. How many of these pills were allowed or given the permission to be made by pharmaceutical companies? Here is the answer-- 14 billion. May I say that again--14 billion opioid pills for our country. The numbers are out of control. The overprescribing is out of control. We have to find a way to dramatically reduce the amount of drugs that are being sold legally in our country. Before we even reach illegal, you have to start with legal. That is the problem because the Drug Enforcement Administration, the agency responsible for deciding how much each pharmaceutical company can manufacture each year, doesn't even announce how much each company is given permission to manufacture; instead they just announce the gross number of total opioid materials that can be put into pills in our country each year. Does anyone understand this in America, that that is the process? The FDA allows the company to sell it. Then it goes over to the DEA. Then the DEA picks a number of pills that can be sold, and then physicians are allowed to prescribe these pills, but this is the FDA's own number. Listen to this. The FDA asks for voluntary guidelines to be put together for physicians' education so they know what they are doing with these opioids. Pick a number in your brain as to how many physicians have voluntarily accepted medical education on the consequences of prescribing opioids. Pick a number. Here is the correct answer: 10 percent of physicians. That is it. On something that is so catastrophic, something that is creating an epidemic in our country, you would think this would be mandatory; that the medical associations at the State level, the national level had created some kind of mandatory education. It hasn't happened. Is it mandatory in medical schools across America that they receive education as to what the consequences are of prescribing opioids? Not at all. So who would think a physician would have to be trained in how to handle pain? I mean, a physician is only dealing with the issue all day long, every single day. You would think there would be some understanding then of what the consequences were of the medicines they were prescribing. No courses in medical school are mandated. No courses are mandated after you have graduated, you are practicing medicine, and now you are licensed by the DEA to prescribe opiates--no courses. So as we move forward on the legislation that is going to be coming out on the floor of the Senate, I intend to make an amendment--Senator Blumenthal and I tried to make it in the Judiciary Committee, and we are going to be making it on the Senate floor--requiring the Drug Enforcement Administration to require mandatory education for any physician who wants to prescribe these drugs. That is the minimum, the minimum that the medical profession should have to accept as a responsibility before they are allowed to prescribe these drugs. There is another amendment which I am working on with Senator Paul of Kentucky, and that is an amendment that is going to increase access to medication that can help people deal with their addictions. Again, that is a classic example of a Democrat and Republican working together on these issues. Senator Ayotte and I have an amendment that would create a Good Samaritan protection for any American, any family member who wants to apply Narcan to a family member or someone who has overdosed and would die in the absence of Narcan, the antidote, being applied to them. Senator Ayotte and I are working on that amendment. We are trying hard to find ways where, unfortunately, legislatively we can act. This should have happened at the agencies. This should have happened in the medical profession. We shouldn't be forced to debate this on the Senate floor, but it is absolutely, [[Page S937]] indispensably necessary for us to take this action. This is the epidemic of our time. The death rates now in the age group that is affected by this epidemic are now declining at the same rates as they did during the war in Vietnam. We haven't seen anything like this since the war in Vietnam in the death rates--30,000 people-- quadrupling in 14 years, escalating on a daily basis. It is time for the Senate to take real action on this issue so we can deal with it. In Boston, MA, we had a police chief who saw that something had gone wrong, Chief Campanello. He said that incarceration doesn't work and instead treatment should be substituted. So beginning last June, what Chief Campanello said in Gloucester, MA, was that if you come in and you are an addict, you have a problem, you come into the police station, bring your drugs with you, we are not going to arrest you, we are going to put you into treatment immediately--no arrests. Four hundred people have walked into that police station in Gloucester, MA, in just 8 months--400 people. By shifting the paradigm from arrests to treatment, 800 more people--800 total across the country--as city after city, town after town adopts this model, have now accepted that as a better route for them in their lives, to just turn themselves in at the local police stations. He has partnered with a man named John Rosenthal. John Rosenthal is an activist in our State, and he helps to fund this program. Last Wednesday night, tragically, John Rosenthal's own nephew, Nathan Huggins-Rosenthal, age 34, died of an overdose in Calgary, Canada. My heart goes out to the Rosenthal family because obviously they were committed to dealing with this issue, pioneering ways to have addicts be able to have a place they can go. Yet in John Rosenthal's own family, his nephew overdosed just last Wednesday night. As Senator Ayotte was saying, there is no neighborhood immunity. There is no family who is completely protected. This epidemic has been created by pharmaceutical companies, by physicians, by the agencies responsible to deal with it, and it is now time for us to put in place the protections which are needed to deal with it. Let me give you opioids 101 so you can understand how we get to this--what are opioids, how do they work, and why do they lead to heroin abuse. Here is how it works. It starts with a seed pod of the opium poppy. We get the morphine, a naturally occurring opiate pain reliever from that pod seed. The morphine interacts with so-called opioid receptors that are found in high concentrations in areas of the brain that control pain and emotions. Taking opiates can increase the levels of dopamine in the brain's reward areas and produce euphoria or a rush of pain relief and relaxation. In fact, morphine, which was first identified in the early 1800s is named after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. In 1895, the Bayer Corporation, Bayer Aspirin--the Bayer Corporation in Germany introduced a new cough suppressant marketed as a safer alternative to morphine. This new wonder drug was called heroin. In the 1920s, drug manufacturers began making fully synthetic analogs to morphine. They were called opioids. These drugs contain the same basic chemical framework as morphine, and they have exactly the same mechanism of action in the brain. They share common chemical features that allow them to buy into the brain's opioid receptors, and they all are considered highly addictive. These drugs vary widely in potency. That is the amount of the drug required to reach the same level of pain relief and sedation as morphine. OxyContin, for example, is 150 percent as strong as morphine. Heroin is also an opioid. They share the same fundamental chemical structure. Heroin binds to the very same receptors in the brain and produces the same euphoria and sedation, and heroin is plagued by the same addiction potential. Heroin is classified as a schedule I drug, the most dangerous class, because it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse and addiction. So this is the pathway between opioids and heroin and why that pathway is very short. It is all about the chemistry because OxyContin has the nearly identical molecular constitution as heroin. Over time, the brain, the receptors are saying: I need to have to continue to have that hit. Thus, we have this epidemic where 80 percent of all people in the United States who are dying from heroin overdoses started on prescription opioid drugs that had been prescribed by their physicians. Physicians should have to be educated. The FDA should have expert advisory panels that give the strongest possible guidance to the pharmaceutical companies. That is what is missing in this equation. It starts there. We need a debate on $1.1 billion for more treatment and more education, and we are going to have that debate on the Senate floor. These local families, these local groups, they are heroes, but heroes need help, and it is time for us to fund those programs in the same way we funded the Ebola crisis and the same way we are being asked to help to fund the Zika crisis. We have a crisis in America ourselves, but if we don't deal with the issue right from the beginning at the FDA, at the DEA, and at the AMA, we are not going to solve this problem. We are just putting medical facilities in place to deal with the consequences of having no policy. This is our great opportunity to have a debate in our country. I can't thank the Members enough for beginning to deal with this issue on a serious basis, but we can't be afraid of the pharmaceutical industry. We can't be afraid of the American Medical Association. We can't be afraid of the bureaucrats in these agencies who say: Oh, Mr. or Ms. Senator, we are the experts. You don't know what you are talking about. Well, just let me tell you this. The people of the United States don't trust the experts anymore in these agencies. They want more accountability. They want other experts to come in to check those experts, to ask the tough questions on behalf of the American people. That is why I have a hold on Dr. Robert Califf's nomination for the FDA, because right now the FDA is saying it is going to continue business as usual and that is just wrong. That is just plain wrong. It has to stop there. The signal must come from this administration. I thank all the Members for this discussion, for where we are today and where we are going to have to go in the months ahead, but I don't think we should end this year without a fundamental change that has taken place in our society in this relationship. I will just add one final issue, and that is the issue of how many pills, how many pills a doctor can prescribe initially to a patient. We are now debating that issue in the State of Massachusetts. Governor Baker has been saying it should only be 3 days' worth of pills. One of the counterproposals is 7 days of pills that can be used by the patient. I do know this. We have to start here because right now doctors are handing out bottles of 60 to patients who only need a week's worth or 3 days' worth. When you leave a dentist's office, you don't need 60 days' worth of pills for your wisdom teeth that have been removed. When you have some pain that you just got from playing a softball game and you have twisted your back, you don't need a bottle of 60 or 30. You might need a few pills for 3 days or 7 days, but you don't need the 60. Having that 60 in that medicine cabinet is the beginning of the problem. I thank Governor Baker for what he is doing on this issue. They haven't resolved it in Massachusetts. I think we have to debate that in the Halls of Congress as well. They are all related, how these pills get into the blood system of our country. Again, I thank all of the Members for their consideration of this issue. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S929-S937] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past weekend the Nation honored Justice Antonin Scalia, who was laid to rest after serving on the Supreme Court for nearly three decades. Marcelle and I were home in Vermont when we learned that Justice Scalia had passed. Frankly, we were stunned by the news. I did not often agree with Justice Scalia, but he was a brilliant jurist with a deep commitment to our country and to the Constitution, and we enjoyed his friendship for decades. He will be remembered as one of the most influential Justices in modern history. While his family and all should have had a chance to mourn his passing, I was shocked when, in the immediate wake of his death, Senate Republicans moved quickly to shut down the constitutionally mandated process to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court. Within hours of his death being announced, they declared they would oppose any effort to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice this year. I have served in this body longer than any Member here and I have heard some shocking things during that time, but I am surprised by the political crassness of these statements. Before a nominee had even been named, some Republicans reflexively decided to prematurely reject anyone--anyone--nominated by the President. This impulsive rush to judgment runs completely contrary to how this body has always treated nominees--always treated nominees--to the highest Court in the land. Republicans should not allow the hyper- partisan rhetoric of the campaign trail to trump one of the Senate's most important constitutional duties. I have talked to the President, and I know he will fulfill his constitutional duty. He will nominate an individual to bring the Supreme Court back to full strength, and of course he should. The President has already begun consulting with Members of both parties in Senate, but after a nomination has been made, we in the Senate should get to work and do our jobs--the jobs we were elected to do. I was all over my State of Vermont last week. The Vermonters I spoke with last week reflect Americans across the country who are tired of partisan political games that are chipping away at the foundation of our constitutional democracy. I heard this from both Republicans and Democrats in Vermont. As Oliver Goodenough, a law professor at Vermont Law School, wrote this weekend in the Rutland Herald, an extended Supreme Court vacancy caused by Senate inaction ``would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 21, 2016] Court Battle--Another Shutdown? (By Oliver R. Goodenough) Within hours of the announcement of Anton Scalia's death, one of our political parties was already trying to make points with the electorate about the process of picking his successor. At that evening's debate, the GOP presidential candidates advocated that the constitutional process should be suspended, either voluntarily by President Barack Obama or by purposeful inaction by the Senate. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, was just as speedy, trying to warn Obama off from acting on the mandate of Article II, Section 2, which charges the president with nominating a replacement for Justice Scalia and the Senate with providing its advice and consent on the president's choice. One can understand McConnell's disappointment. Appointments to the Supreme Court are for life, which means only resignation, impeachment or death will create a vacancy. In the somewhat ghoulish game of waiting for a slot on the closely divided Supreme Court to open up, the short-term expectations of mortality had been focused elsewhere--Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, in particular, has been a survivor of long-odds pancreatic cancer. So Republicans were brought up short by the death of a conservative hero, whose replacement could shift the balance of the court. The accidents of history will do that sometimes. The Constitution makes provision for what happens in such a case--in the kind of clear, unequivocal language that is the best target for Justice Scalia's vaunted originalism. The president nominates. The Senate, for its part, gives the qualifications of any nominee a serious vetting; it is not entitled to just ignore the nomination. Some reports have argued that such a course of process sabotage would create a ``constitutional crisis.'' This is probably an overstatement; it would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment. With nearly a year left in Obama's term, waiting for his successor to name the new justice in 2017 would remove the ninth voice from the court not just for the current yearly term but also for most of the following term as well, since the replacement would arrive in the spring and miss months of argument and deliberation. For the better part of a year, the vacancy would sit like a broken tooth in the operations of the court. Close cases would often end up tied, with the result that the lower court finding would remain the binding result. Not itself a disaster, but a result that the constitutional provisions for naming a successor are designed to avoid. The embarrassment of sabotage on judicial appointments actually already exists: Republicans in the Senate have effectively shut down the process of nominating new judges for the federal courts of appeal. The blockage isn't over qualifications--such considerations would be a proper exercise of the Senate's confirmation role, raised in committee and on the Senate floor Rather, the nominations are sitting in a limbo of inaction: It is simply a matter of not doing the job at all. This is the real crisis, a state of politics where Republicans in the House and Senate are willing to derail the processes of government to thwart the actions of President Obama, good, bad or indifferent. The most obvious example was the full shutdown of government. Limited shutdowns on matters like judicial appointments are parts of the same pattern. Of course, obstructionism is not just a Republican failing, and it can be present in both parties to some degree in the spicy stew of politics in our robust democracy. But the bottom-line commitment of all parties should be to maintaining a functioning government, structured and administered in accordance with the framework set out in our Constitution, even when it is not working to their advantage. Why is this so hard for at least some Republicans to buy into? Why the willingness, indeed eagerness, to bring down the house we all live in? The key is a widespread denial among Republicans of the legitimacy of the Obama presidency. This is partly related to the man himself--all the blather about his birth, his religion, etc. While many Americans find it a vindication that we can elect an African-American to our highest office, for some it is an impossibility which in turn justifies the most extreme forms of resistance. Race is our original sin as a country, and its legacy haunts us still. Republicans are also in denial over changes in the social and economic fabric of America. We are, as always, in the process of moving from what America has been to what it will be. Conservatives have a role to play, reminding us of the valuable parts of where we came from. Progressives have a role, recognizing the imperatives of the future and charting the paths of change toward positive outcomes. Politics is the sometimes rough and tumble playing field where the dialog on this goes forward. The intransigence of shutdowns, however, whether of the full government or a critical aspect like the nomination process, exceeds the boundaries of acceptable play and hurts us all. Obama needs to make a good faith nomination to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate majority need to review it in good faith. That is what the Constitution provides; that is what the country needs. Get on with it. Mr. LEAHY. We must not let that dysfunction infect the Supreme Court, an independent, coequal branch of government that was designed to be above politics. The next nominee to the Supreme Court deserves full and fair consideration by the Senate. This includes a timely hearing and then having an up-or-down vote. I am worried that even before President Obama took office, and ever since then--even after he was reelected by a 5 million-vote plurality-- there has been an unrelenting and cynical campaign by some hyper- partisans to delegitimize the President's authority. There were the birthers, and there have been and still are spurious slurs of all kinds. Outside of this body, the efforts to undermine President Obama's constitutional authority to fill this Supreme Court vacancy draws some of their vehemence and venom from these dark corners. But every one of us took an oath of office--every one of us--and we [[Page S930]] are sworn to uphold our constitutional duties. Let us not be intimidated and pressured to avoid our sworn duty. Let us act for the good of the American people and for the good of this great Nation. Some have justified their call for unprecedented obstruction by claiming it is because the American people need a voice. Give me a break. The American people have spoken--millions of Americans--and an overwhelming majority of Vermonters voted in record numbers in 2008 and again in 2012 to elect President Obama. In doing so, they granted him constitutional authorities for all 8 years of those two terms. A President isn't elected for 1 year or 2 years or 3 years. A President is elected for 4 years at a time. Just saying that President Obama is a ``lame duck'' President does not make it true. In fact, the next election is not until November. The American people expect those they elected to do their jobs for their entire term. That means both in the Senate and in the White House. They don't expect Senators to say: Well, we can't vote on anything this year because it is an election year. We will collect our full salary, but we are not going to vote on anything. The American people don't like that. It is rare that a vacancy in the Supreme Court arises during an election year, but it is just false to say Justices do not get confirmed in Presidential election years. More than a dozen Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in a Presidential election year. The Democrats led the Senate during President Reagan's final year in office, and we voted. President Reagan's nominee was confirmed by a Democratic-led Senate during the President's final year in office. He received a hearing and a confirmation vote. It would be the height of hypocrisy to say we shouldn't apply the same process with a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in control of the Senate. We can't say that we will follow our constitutional duties and do our work if we have a Democratic-controlled Senate and a Republican President but we can't do it if it is the other way around. Some Republican Senators have acknowledged that the next Supreme Court nominee should receive a fair hearing. But the process can't end there. I have served on the Judiciary Committee for 36 years. During my time on the committee, we have never refused to send a Supreme Court nominee to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. Even in those cases where a majority of the committee had opposed the nomination, we still reported the nominee to the full Senate. Once reported to the full Senate, every Supreme Court nominee has received an up-or-down confirmation vote during my 40 years in the Senate. We have to uphold this bipartisan tradition for the next Supreme Court nominee because so much is at stake. Merely holding a hearing without full committee process and a confirmation vote is insufficient for a Supreme Court nominee. It would be a charade, and it would be an avoidance of our constitutional duties. If Republicans refuse to uphold their constitutional responsibility to consider the next Supreme Court nominee, I believe it will harm our constitutional system of government. If they succeed in deliberately holding open a seat on the Supreme Court for more than a year, they will be intentionally disabling the Court's ability to fulfill its constitutional role, and Republicans will be harming the Supreme Court for more than a year. Justice Scalia once wrote that a Supreme Court of just eight Justices risked the possibility the Court ``will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.'' The legal issues before the Supreme Court are significant, and the importance of a single vote on the Court cannot be overstated. One vote on the Supreme Court decided landmark cases concerning our campaign finance laws, clean water and air policies, marriage equality, and voting rights. Americans deserve a fully functioning Supreme Court. I have traveled all over my State. I have traveled all over this country. I have talked to Republicans and Democrats alike. What I know about my fellow Americans that makes me so proud is that they show up for work and they do their jobs. Americans don't have the luxury of telling their bosses that instead of doing their job, they would rather delay, delay, delay. If they did, they would probably be fired. The U.S. Senate shouldn't tell the American people that we are not going to do our jobs; that we will delay, delay, delay. The stakes are too high. The American people actually expect us to show up for work and do our job. Let's get to work, do the job the American people sent us here to do. And we may want to reread our oath to uphold the Constitution. It requires no less. Mr. President, I don't see others on the floor about to speak. I will yield the floor when I do. We have allowed this whole process to become far too partisan. I am a lawyer, a former prosecutor. I have argued cases in the State court, Federal courts, Federal trial courts, and Federal appellate courts. When I have gone to the Federal courts, I have always thought that the beauty of this--whether Republican or Democratic nominees--is that I could get a fair hearing. I thought it was a great honor to go there. People come from other parts of the world, and they talk about our Federal judiciary as an example for them. I recall that when a country that had been under dictatorship changed to a more democratic form of government, some of their people came to my office and asked about our judicial system. They said: Is it true that in the United States of America, people can actually sue their government? I said: That is true. It happens all the time. They said: Well, is it true that sometimes the government loses? I said: It happens all the time. They said: Well, do you replace the judge when that happens? I said: No. They are independent. It was like a lightbulb went on. They realized how different we are. Think of the image we send to the rest of the world--as well as 300 million Americans--if we say: No, we are going to politicize the Supreme Court, the Court that is supposed to be the final arbiter on constitutional questions. Look at what it says to them if we say: Yes, we have time to take more recesses this year than I think the Senate ever has, that I can ever remember, but we don't have time to do the job we were elected to do, the job we are paid to do--have a hearing on and vote on a Supreme Court nominee. The American people have jobs. They can't pick and choose when they will bother to show up. They can't say ``I know this is what I am supposed to do in this job, but I don't feel like it'' or ``I have a partisan reason not to do it. I am going to sit this out. See me next year, and I may do my job.'' Nobody would accept that. But that is really what is happening. The Republican leadership is saying ``No, we want to sit this out. We don't want to do our work. We don't want to do our job. See us next year, and maybe we will then.'' That has never happened. It never happened during an election year. There have been at least a dozen Supreme Court vacancies during an election year, and a dozen times the Senate, no matter who was President, came together and handled the nominee and got them confirmed. Why did Senators do that in the past? Probably because they figured they had been elected, they were being paid by the American people, it was part of their job, and so they showed up and did their job. Are we now going to change what has been the precedent ever since the beginning of this country and say ``Oh, we are better than that. We don't have to do our job. Keep paying us, but we don't have to do our job even though we have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and do our job''? Even Justice Scalia said that would be wrong, that you shouldn't have an eight-member Supreme Court. And we don't. Let's actually show up and do the job we were elected to do, do the job we are paid to do. Let's do what every other American has to do. They have to show up for work. They have to do their jobs. They can't say ``I don't feel like it this year. I will see you next year. Oh, by the way, send me my paycheck.'' That is not the American way; it should not be the Senate way. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S931]] Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today first to praise and echo the words of the senior Senator from Vermont, our ranking member on Judiciary, in urging our Republican colleagues to give a fair and full consideration of a Supreme Court nominee. I particularly wish to praise my friend, the ranking member, for his eloquent remarks and for his leadership of the committee when he was chair and as ranking member. My friend from Vermont is absolutely right. Just as the President has a constitutional responsibility to name a nominee to the Court, the Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on that nominee. Frankly, it is the Senate's job to consider Supreme Court nominees, and the American people expect the Senate to do its job. We are telling Senate Republicans, America is telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. Plain and simple. My friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, should commit to holding hearings. The distinguished majority leader should commit to holding a vote. It has been a longstanding precedent of the Senate to consider Supreme Court nominees in a timely manner, even in election years: Justice Pitney in 1912; Brandeis and Clarke in 1916; Cardozo at a time when America was even more divided than now, 1932. In the middle of the Depression, the great election between Roosevelt and Hoover, they put in Cardozo in that last year. Murphy in 1940 and Kennedy in 1988 were confirmed. Justice Kennedy was confirmed in the last year of a Presidency with a Republican in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate. That is the mirror image and the most recent chance we have to compare how Democrats were acting, how Republicans were acting. All of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who were here voted that way. I know today our Republican colleagues point to what Senator Biden said. They have pointed to what Chairman Leahy said. They have pointed to what I and other Democrats have said. There are equal quotations that Senator McConnell, Senator Grassley, and others have said, each voicing a different view than maybe is being voiced today. But none of those were held up. You can have all the competing quotes you want; they amount to nothing. The American people are strong--Democrats and Republicans--in telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. The bottom line is very simple. To say that there will be no hearing, no vote, no consideration whatsoever even before a nominee is named to a vacancy, that is not doing your job; that is quitting before you start. Senator Leahy said it well. Imagine someone showing up at work. Imagine if an average American showed up at work and said: I am going to take a year off, but you still have to pay me. Your boss wouldn't stand for it. Well, our boss, the American people, will not stand for this because it will take over 300 days before a Supreme Court nominee is filled, at best. The kind of knee-jerk political obstruction the American people have grown so frustrated with in the Congress is what our Republican colleagues are saying. If Republicans truly respect the Constitution, they should follow it and consider a nomination from the sitting President rather than playing political games. Instead, they are once again threatening to bow to the most extreme rightwing voices and engage in the kind of political obstruction that brought us a 3-week government shutdown that cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and took $15 to $20 billion out of the economy. In 2013, after the hard right didn't get its way in its fight to undo the Affordable Care Act, they waged a war to shut down the government. Republican leaders listened. They probably knew it was wrong in their heads, but they listened. What happened? After 3 weeks with their tails between their legs, the leadership had to say we have to open up the government even though we haven't repealed the Affordable Care Act. The now-junior Senator from Texas had urged that course, and they were foolhardy to follow. The junior Senator from Texas is now urging the course of having no hearings and no votes. I tell my Republican colleagues--and to his credit, Senator McConnell said we have to get the Senate working again--that this is a foolhardy course, and it will not stand. It will not last because the American people are telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. Republicans say the American people should have a voice in choosing a Supreme Court Justice. Well, guess what. President Obama won reelection by a large margin in 2012. Many of the issues they bring up now were there then, such as security and the Affordable Care Act. There was a referendum on all these kinds of things. The people spoke loudly and clearly on November 6, 2012, when they elected the President to another 4-year term. That is 4 years, as called for in the Constitution, not 3 years, as some of my Republican friends like to say now. If Republicans get their way, we would have a 4-to-4 gridlocked Supreme Court for a year that would tie the Court and large parts of the country in knots. Let me say, if we have a tie in the Supreme Court decision, the decision has no Presidential value. You get gridlock and confusion. America doesn't want gridlock. They don't want gridlock on the floor of the Senate, they don't want gridlock on the floor of the House, and they don't want gridlock in the Supreme Court. The American people expect the Senate to do its job. They are tired of obstruction and ``my way or the highway'' politics. Again I say that our friend, the junior Senator from Texas, likes to quote the Constitution. He likes to walk around carrying the Constitution. That is great. I am all for that. I would like him to show me the lines in the Constitution that say in the last year of the President's term, he doesn't have the power or the right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice. Of course he does. Yet the Republican majority-- at least by its stance now--is taking away that right because they will not even have a hearing. Some people say: Well, they will just vote no after the hearing. Maybe yes, maybe no. I believe every Member has the right to vote no if they think the nominee is out of the mainstream, and I will be the first to admit mainstream is defined differently by different people. But hearings are amazing things. If the candidate is being open and honest, hearings help us to get to know the candidate better. Whatever one thinks of hearings, the last four nominees of the Supreme Court-- two under President Bush, two under President Obama--got bipartisan votes and passed. This idea of not having a vote is wrong. For the sake of our Constitution and for the sake of getting our country moving again, I urge and plead with my colleagues on the other side to do their job. That is what the American people want, plain and simple. It is time for the Senate to do its job. Once the President nominates someone, we need to have hearings with our Republican colleagues in a careful and thoughtful way. They don't have to rush a nominee through-- no dilatory tactics--and then there should be a vote. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia and Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on February 13 the Nation was shaken by the news that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away. Justice Scalia served on the Nation's highest Court for 29 years, and he was a major figure on the American legal landscape. Justice Scalia was described by Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit as ``the most influential justice of the last quarter century.'' Over the years I came to know Justice Scalia. He was a man of great intellect, good humor, and he was a very social person. We certainly disagreed on many fundamental issues, but even those who disagreed with Justice Scalia on legal matters still admired him as a person. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--no ideological ally of Justice Scalia-- wrote [[Page S932]] after his death, ``we were best buddies.'' She described him as ``a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit, with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh.'' Justice Ginsberg said she and Justice Scalia were ``different in our interpretation of written texts,'' but they were ``one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.'' I have great respect for the decades Justice Scalia spent in public service. My thoughts and prayers clearly go with his family. As surprised as I was by the news of Justice Scalia's passing, I was amazed at how quickly the Senate majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, issued a press release saying, ``this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.'' His statement came out within 90 minutes of the press report of the Justice passing. This statement clearly came at a time when most people reflected on the loss of the Supreme Court Justice, and just like that, the conversation shifted from the passing of an American legal giant to an attack on President Obama's authority to fill his vacancy on the Supreme Court. What does the Constitution tell us about filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court? There are very few oaths a person takes in their life. As Members of the Senate, we swear each time we are reelected to a new term to uphold and defend that Constitution. What does the Constitution say about a vacancy on the Supreme Court? If you go to article II, section 2, it is explicit and very simple. The President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court.'' The President, under the Constitution, has an express responsibility to submit to the Senate the nomination of a person who is qualified to serve on our Nation's highest Court. Then, of course, the Senate has a job to do: Give that nominee a fair hearing and a timely vote. This is our constitutional responsibility as U.S. Senators. This is what we have been elected to do. Aside from voting on a declaration of war, I believe there is no greater responsibility than voting on the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. I serve on the Judiciary Committee, and it has been my privilege and honor to consider the nominations of four of the current Supreme Court Justices. There is no question that we have the time remaining to meet our constitutional responsibility in a thoughtful and careful way. It is now February of 2016. We are almost a year away from January of 2017 when President Obama will officially leave office. The Republican leader would have us leave a seat on the Nation's highest Court vacant for at least 1 year. Not since the Civil War has the Senate taken longer than a year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, and it certainly shouldn't happen now. Usually it takes the Senate about 2 months to consider a Supreme Court nominee. Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said that on average it takes about 67 days. So we have more than enough time to do this in a thoughtful and responsible way. Even during Presidential election years, the Senate has routinely confirmed Supreme Court Justices. It has happened over a dozen times, most recently in 1988, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed by a 97-to-0 vote during President Reagan's final year in office. President Reagan--a Republican President about to leave office--submitted a name, Justice Kennedy, to the Supreme Court, and a Democratic-controlled Senate approved it with a vote of 97 to nothing. So to argue that this has never happened before is to ignore history, and even recent history. In the past, Senate Republican leaders have said that the confirmation process should move forward with as little time as a month before an election. Consider the Presidential election of 1968. On June 13 of that year, Chief Justice Earl Warren informed the President he wanted to step down. On June 26 of the election year, Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to become Chief Justice and nominated George Homer Thornberry to fill his seat. President Johnson had already announced he would not run again, but Senate Republican leaders did not call President Johnson a lame duck and question his right to put forward nominees. In fact, Senate Republican leader Everett Dirksen of my State of Illinois said on July 13 of that year, ``I find that term `lame duck' as applied to the President of the United States as an entirely improper and offensive term.'' Republican Senator Dirksen was referring to the lame duck status of President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat. The Senate gave the President's nominee a prompt hearing in the Judiciary Committee. As it turned out, the hearing uncovered a range of ethics concerns about Justice Fortas, and in late September and early October, Senate Republicans filibustered his nomination. Fortas subsequently withdrew. But on October 3--same election year, just a month before the election--the New York Times reported that ``Senator Dirksen said there was still time for the President to submit a new name and rush it through the Senate before the Congress adjourned.'' The Republican leader said that even with a month left, we should try to fill the vacant seat. This was a month before the Presidential election. Where are the leaders like Everett Dirksen in today's Republican Party, Senators who are willing to roll up their sleeves and get down to the work of considering the nominees on their merits so the Supreme Court can do its work? We have a constitutional responsibility, as does the President. Make no mistake--the Supreme Court needs a full complement of Justices on the bench. When the Court has an even number, as it does today, four to four, important cases are increasingly likely to end up in a tie vote. When that happens in a case, the ruling of the lower court stands and it is as if the Supreme Court never heard the case at all. Major legal and constitutional questions are constantly brought before the Court. When the Court is frozen at an even number of Justices, many of those questions go unresolved and millions of Americans who are impacted by these questions have to wait. That is not fair to the American people. That is why historically the Senate moved to fill vacancies of the Court. That is why so many Americans are troubled by Senate Republicans' call for a 1-year hiatus in filling the Supreme Court vacancy. Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said in an interview last week that she disagreed with the idea of waiting for the next President to appoint a new Justice. Justice O'Connor said, ``We need somebody there now to do the job. Let's get on with it.'' I agree with Justice O'Connor. When President Obama submits a nominee, which he will do in coming days, the Senate needs to do its job, its constitutional responsibility, and give that nominee a fair hearing and timely vote. My Republican colleagues can choose to vote for or against the nominee. That is their prerogative. They should not simply duck the vote. We were not elected to this job to ignore important issues; we were elected to cast votes on important issues. This is too important an issue to simply ignore. When it comes to giving the President's nominee a fair hearing, I certainly hope Senate Republicans don't adopt the Donald Trump position. When asked about the President's nomination, Mr. Trump, as he is wont to do, gave us a juicy quote. Here is what he said: ``I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it--it's called delay, delay, delay.'' I am sure the Senate Republicans were not happy with that statement by Trump, but he did speak for a number of people who believe that is the right strategy: stop the President from using his constitutional authority; stop the Senate from accepting its constitutional responsibility. I hope my Republican colleagues don't follow Mr. Trump's lead and try to stop President Obama's nominee through endless delays. No one is going to be fooled if Senate Republicans spend weeks haggling over unreasonable document requests or swamping the nominee with endless written questions. Mr. Trump has already made it clear that ``delay, delay, delay'' is simply a strategy to stop the seat from being filled. If Republicans delay in an effort to run out the clock, we will know it, and the American people will know it. The American people want us to act. They want us to accept our constitutional [[Page S933]] responsibility. It is time for us to get down to work and do our job. The Senate can't afford to sit on its hands for 1 year and leave the Supreme Court hanging in the balance. When President Obama names a nominee, I urge my Republican colleagues to give that person a fair hearing and timely vote. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING CHAIR. The Senator from New Hampshire. Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my serious concerns with the FDA's actions on opioid pain relievers and my concern that they have not sufficiently addressed what we are seeing as an epidemic in my home State of New Hampshire. The implications of prescribing opioids and ensuring that we take a very strong public health approach toward these pain relievers is important. I know my that my colleagues--Senators Markey, Manchin, and Blumenthal--have been on the floor previously to discuss the concerns they share about the FDA as well. I thank them for their leadership on this important issue. I think what is important to understand here is what we are facing when it comes to heroin, the drug deaths that are occurring in my home State of New Hampshire, the connection between people who are misusing prescription opioids and then becoming addicted to heroin, and the deadly use of a drug called fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. When we bring this all together, we have a situation with opioid abuse which includes painkiller abuse, heroin use, fentanyl abuse, and it is killing people in New Hampshire and across this country. Across this country, approximately 30,000 people died of heroin or prescription opioid overdoses in 2014. As we come to receive the 2015 numbers, unfortunately, if the experience is anything like my home State of New Hampshire, the numbers are going to be much larger than 30,000 because in New Hampshire, every corner of my State has been impacted by this. I had the privilege of serving as attorney general before I came to the Senate, and I dealt with many drug issues as attorney general. In fact, I had a drug task force that reported to me. We dealt with the surge of methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illegal drugs that certainly have caused addiction and people to struggle with addiction. Obviously, alcohol is also something people struggle with when it is misused, but I have never seen anything like this. I talk to my law enforcement officers and I talk to my first responders about what they are dealing with. In 2015, in New Hampshire, we had over 400 overdose deaths, and those 400 deaths were situations where there was a combination--many of them, hundreds of them--of heroin and/or fentanyl. And that was a dramatic increase over 2014. In 2014, we had 320 deaths. And by the way, that is a 60-percent increase from the year before. Unfortunately, this is not stopping. It is the single most important public health and safety issue facing the State of New Hampshire right now, but I know New Hampshire is not alone. Certainly working with my colleague Rob Portman from Ohio, I know this is hitting Ohio. Working with Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island, I know this is hitting Rhode Island. Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota--this is hitting so many different places in our country. That is why I know Senator Markey from Massachusetts is concerned about this and Senator Manchin from West Virginia, who was on the floor earlier. This is about our quality of life in this country and the ability for people to live full lives and about our public safety and about our children most of all. The headline from the Union Leader over this weekend: ``Fentanyl, other drugs suspected in three Manchester deaths.'' So we had three deaths in New Hampshire, in our largest city, within 24 hours, and those three deaths were from a combination of heroin and fentanyl. According to Assistant Fire Chief Daniel Goonan, in just 24 hours in Manchester, these overdoses claimed the lives of a 23-year-old man, a 29-year-old woman, and a 34-year-old man. That was in just a 24-hour period. In fact, what our first responders are seeing--I did a ride-along with the Manchester fire department. I was there less than an hour. We went to an overdose, and I saw the firefighters and their emergency personnel bring someone back to life using CPR and Narcan. If we did not have that drug, the over 400 we had in New Hampshire--I can't even tell you what the numbers would be, because not only did I do a ride- along with the Manchester fire department, I did one with the police, too, and we went to two overdoses in an hour and a half, and I saw them bring those individuals back to life. But lest we think this is something that happens on some other street or in some other neighborhood, I can assure you that this can happen to any family, and that is something we need to understand. That was really brought home for me from a wonderful family I met, Doug and Pam Griffin, who lost their beautiful daughter Courtney. They are wonderful people. I think about what our first responders are facing. This same article I just talked about, over the weekend--unbelievable. Twice the fire department in Manchester revived a woman who was 4 months pregnant, working on her in front of her young children. I will never forget the overdose I went to. The firefighters came into the room, and there was a young man on the ground. They administered the Narcan and brought him back. But do you know what was in the corner? A crib with a baby in it. The firefighter grabbed the baby and was bringing the baby over. The father was lying on the ground. So this is having a tremendous impact on not only those who are struggling with addiction but also their families and the children around them and the future generations. In this article, the assistant fire chief from Manchester basically said: It is more deadly than we have ever seen. So that is why I have been proud to work with my colleagues, proud to work with Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Klobuchar, and so many others on the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act. I thank the members of the Judiciary Committee for voting that important piece of legislation out of the committee, and I look forward to us taking that up on the floor. Right now pending on the floor, we have an important nomination for the FDA. That is why I come to the floor today, because if you look at what we are addressing here, we are concerned about heroin and fentanyl, but there is a very important connection for us to understand, unfortunately, and it is also why I have been such a strong supporter of prescription-monitoring programs. The opiates that are prescribed--SAMHSA has found that four out of five individuals who turned to heroin actually started with prescription opiates and misusing prescription opiates or overusing those and then transitioning to heroin because heroin is cheaper, unfortunately, on our streets. So it is very important that we have the FDA engaging on this issue very aggressively with our medical community, that the FDA take a prominent role in ensuring that what they are saying is, this is the appropriate use of prescription opiates. In my humble opinion, the FDA needs to take a much more aggressive role than it has in recommending the appropriate uses and engaging the medical community and the pharmaceutical community, very importantly, on this discussion, this public health crisis we are facing. We have come together as a body on this issue, and I think it is important that we have been working on this in a very bipartisan basis. But just to talk about the importance of the FDA and the leadership we need there, in 2013 we saw the FDA approve Zohydro--a powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation, and an abuse- deterrent formulation is important so that it will be used for its intended purpose and not chopped up or otherwise abused. Yet the FDA approves Zohydro--this powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation despite the fact that its own advisory committee voted against approving the drug by a vote of 11 to 2. I see Senator Markey coming to the floor, and I appreciate his leadership on this. One of the things that I know have troubled Senator Markey, Senator Manchin, and me as well is that last year the FDA approved OxyContin [[Page S934]] for use by children as young as 11, and when they did that, they did not have an advisory committee or use an advisory committee before taking that step. So I would say that I certainly appreciate that I had the opportunity to sit down with Secretary Burwell on this issue and learn more about the FDA's action plan that it issued, but unfortunately I believe the agency has to go further than it is going. The example I would use is the issuance of the recommendations for the children as young as 11 with OxyContin, without an advisory committee on something so important, seems--to me, it just doesn't pass the commonsense test. So I would recommend to the FDA, let's make sure we have an advisory committee look at this issue carefully and then reissue a recommendation, because to me it seems important that we have that guidance and the careful, thoughtful approach of the advisory committee. Of course, what troubles me is we hope they would take the advisory committee's recommendations, unlike what happened with Zohydro, unfortunately. So we need leadership right now in the FDA. I have concerns that we are not going to be in a position where we get the strongest leadership we can have. We have a nominee pending on the floor. These concerns are very important. I hope, if he is confirmed, he will be aggressive on this issue and that the FDA will take a stronger leadership role on opiates, understanding that they have a very important role when it comes to this public health concern. Right now I am not satisfied with where we are. I believe there is so much more we need to do. That is actually why yesterday I voted to not go forward with this nomination, because I haven't heard this clear statement, I haven't heard what the leadership plans are on this issue. While I appreciate some of the steps the Department of Health and Human Services has taken, those steps to me need to be very much strengthened. As I look at the FDA's action plan, it pledges to make the use of advisory committees more frequent, but it should require the use of advisory committees for all opioid pain relievers, not just when we decide we want to use it. This should be consistent, given that we unfortunately know that the data is there on the connection between misuse of opioid pain relievers and the connection to those who unfortunately then turn to heroin, with the deadly combination of fentanyl, which is killing people in this country. Again, I wish to thank Senator Markey for his leadership on this issue. There isn't a place I go in my State where I don't hear from a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a grandmother, a grandfather, a friend about someone who lost a loved one, lost someone they care about, because of heroin, opioids, fentanyl, the deadly combination that is killing people. We have an opportunity, not only with the important work in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to add more resources to address prevention, treatment, and support for our first responders but also the FDA has a very important role, and we need stronger leadership there and greater engagement of our medical community on the best prescribing practices for opioids. To me, this is an opportunity where I would like to see stronger leadership and I would like to hear a much more aggressive stance from this FDA. Of all the issues we struggle with, the things we disagree on in this body--heroin, fentanyl, they don't care whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, I can assure my colleagues, or an Independent or a Libertarian because these drugs are taking everyone's lives. So as I think about all the issues we can come together on, this is one about our public health, about our public safety, about our quality of life, and it requires all of our leadership. There is nothing partisan about this. I hope we will see stronger leadership from the FDA. I hope we as a body will build on what the Judiciary Committee did and bring to the floor the CARA bill that many of us have worked hard on and support each other's efforts to do all we can to end this public health crisis and ensure that none of us have to run into families of people in our State whom we represent who are losing people they love to heroin or fentanyl or misuse of opioid prescription drugs. This is devastating. I know we can make a difference. This is something we can make a difference on in this body. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to follow on with the discussion that Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire was bringing to the Senate floor. What she is saying is just so accurate in terms of the pervasive nature of this opioid-driven epidemic--pandemic--in the United States of America. It is time for us to come together in a bipartisan fashion to deal with what is now the great medical storm sweeping across this country. There has been a quadrupling of opioid-related deaths in just the last 14 years in our country. This is something that has to be understood. I heard Senator Ayotte mention it, but we can't say it enough: 80 percent of all people in the United States who die from heroin overdoses begin with prescription painkillers--opioids--that have been given to them by physicians. Let me say that again. Eighty percent of the people who die from heroin overdoses started on prescription pills. They got addicted to the prescription painkiller. It deals with the same receptors in the brain. It creates the same kind of need in the brain, and when people get addicted to prescription pain medicine, it is ultimately a very short to a product which is much less expensive--heroin--on the streets of the United States. This epidemic has to be dealt with and it has to be dealt with where it starts and it starts at the FDA. It starts at the Food and Drug Administration. It starts with the agency that approves these drugs for sale in the United States of America. Yes, the FDA stands for Food and Drug Administration, but over the last 20 years it really stands for ``Fostering Drug Addiction,'' and it has to end. This is why the nomination right now of Dr. Robert Califf to be the new head of the FDA gives us an opportunity to talk about this issue, to talk about where it all starts, how it began, and what we are going to have to do in this body to reverse this trend, which last year led to the deaths of 30,000 people in our country. Again, I say to my colleagues that between 2000 and 2014, the heroin overdose death rate has quadrupled in the United States of America. This is something that is recent. It is related to the FDA, and we have to now have an honest discussion about the role that agency is playing because we have become the ``United States of Oxy.'' We have become a nation of 5 percent of the world's population that consumes 80 percent of the prescription painkillers in the world. This overprescribing, this consumption of Oxy and Percocet, down the line has led to this epidemic, this contagion that is killing people on a daily basis in our country who otherwise would never have even contemplated using heroin or using any of these other more dangerous drugs. That is why we are here. That is why I am recommending a ``no'' vote on Dr. Robert Califf. The FDA has a chance to change its policies. Thus far, it is saying it will not change its policies. In 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers. That is enough for every single adult in America to have a bottle of these pills in their medicine cabinet. We should understand as we talk about this that the molecular composition of OxyContin is very similar to heroin. In fact, Oxycodone is the sole ingredient in OxyContin. OxyContin stands for oxycodone continuously in the bloodstream of the patient who is taking these pills. It creates this sense that you are able to deal with the pain. It creates this sense that you are being taken care of, but if it is not handled correctly over time, it then creates an addiction, and that addiction then leads to, once you are off these pills, to being out on the street buying the heroin or buying the Oxy you need in order to continue this habit. So we have to start to deal with the issue very realistically in terms of this pathway that has been created into the minds of millions of people all across this country. Thirteen hundred people died in Massachusetts in 2014, of the 30,000 people [[Page S935]] in our country, as a result of this issue. We have the FDA, going back to the year 1996, accepting the misrepresentation of the pharmaceutical company Purdue, which represented to the FDA that OxyContin, in its original formulation, was abuse deterrent, meaning that since it was time-released inside of the patient, that, therefore, it was abuse deterrent and it could be prescribed safely to people all across our country. Well, it turned out that not only was that a misrepresentation to the FDA, but Purdue Pharma subsequently was fined millions of dollars and its executives punished for the misrepresentation they made to the Food and Drug Administration. That was a brief 20 years ago, but that is pretty much where it all started. That is the original sin--accepting this whole notion of abuse deterrent. Let's go to the FDA in more recent times. In 2012, there was a new opioid that the FDA had to consider for approval. That new opioid's name is Zohydro. The FDA impaneled 13 experts to examine that drug for the FDA. When those 13 experts concluded their examination of the drug by an 11-to-2 vote, the expert advisory panel voted, no, do not allow this new Zohydro drug out on to the marketplace. They said the standards for abuse are too low. The standards to deal with addiction are too low. The standards to deal with a diversion of the drug are too low. What did the FDA do in 2012? It approved Zohydro for sale in the United States over the objections of the advisory panel that had voted 11 to 2 against it--and these are experts. Moving forward, the FDA decided to reexamine what it was going to do. So when it was considering Targiniq, when it was considering Hysinla, it decided to solve the problem by having no expert advisory panels which it would convene to examine the impacts of that drug before it got approved. That is a good way to solve the problem--just accept the representations of the company that it had abuse deterrent in it, and then you don't have to worry because you will not have to talk to experts on the outside again. So those two drugs got approved. Then, in August of 2015, there was an application by Purdue Pharma, once again--that company's name just keeps coming back into the equation--they wanted approval to sell OxyContin to children ages 11 to 16. Now mind you, the actual standards at the FDA require an outside expert panel to look at approval for opioids being sold in America if it is controversial, if it could have a huge social impact in our society. And it specifically says in the FDA's own guidelines that if pediatric doses--if the proper dose for a child is involved--then the FDA should have an expert panel. What did the FDA do? The FDA decided no expert panel would examine the appropriateness of OxyContin being prescribed for children ages 11 to 16 in our country--no expert advisory panel, which brings us to the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf. We are now in a process where we are examining his nomination and his qualifications. This Senator leaves aside his own personal qualifications. This is not a debate, really, over Dr. Califf. It is a debate over the agency because the agency is saying--even today as we will be voting on Dr. Califf's nomination--they will not change. They will not convene expert outside advisory panels to look at this new generation of opioids with abuse deterrents built into them to determine whether or not they are actually appropriately being put into our society. Today is the day to begin this debate. This nomination is the occasion that we can use in order to debate what has gone wrong at the Food and Drug Administration. If we don't start with a brandnew definition that gets created for abuse, for addiction, for what the standards should be for the use of these opioids, then this issue is just going to escalate until we are losing a Vietnam war's number of people every single year in the United States. This is a pharmaceutical industry-created problem. This is a physician-created problem. This is an FDA-created problem. It is created by men and women, and it can be solved by men and women. This is not Zika, this is not Ebola, and this is not some disease that you can't really point to that is responsible. This is us, this is our country, and this is our culture. We did it. We created this problem. We are 5 percent of the world's population consuming 80 percent of all opioids--crazy. Really, it is crazy. We have to finally come to the recognition that this is no longer some inner city heroin epidemic. This disease knows no barrier--racial, income, geography, employment--no barriers at all. It is spread across every single segment of the American population, top to bottom. There is no discrimination whatsoever. We have to decide what we are going to do in order to make sure that we put the proper safeguards in place. Senator Manchin and I, Senators Ayotte, Sanders, Blumenthal, and others have been raising these questions. To the credit of the Senate Judiciary Committee, they are considering legislation to bring to the floor. I thank Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Shaheen, Ayotte, and Senators Grassley and Leahy for their work on that legislation, but that legislation does not conclude anything on this issue that I am talking about right now. This has to be solved by the FDA. That is why this Senator has put a hold on this nomination, saying that they will not get this nomination until they change their policies. We are in the eighth year of this administration, and the policies still remain in place. Abuse deterrent is really a contradiction in terms. If you take these pills--you are a carpenter or an ironworker, and you have a bad back-- you start taking these OxyContin pills right now, and you take them as they are prescribed, and you keep going month after month after month. You are increasing the likelihood on a daily basis that you are going to become addicted to these pills. We have heard these stories over and over again about the pathway in from family members. They come into the office and talk about the pathway in that their child, husband, or son took. It all starts with the same story. They were given the prescribed pills. Right now the industry is saying: Don't worry; there is an abuse deterrent. Tell that to these family members. Tell that to the families who have lost their loved ones. The drugs are not abuse deterrent. It is a contradiction in terms, like jumbo shrimp. There is no such thing. You need to be realistic about what this drug represents once it is consumed over and over again by people in our country who think that because the doctor has given them a bottle of pills, that is going to help them. That is one of the stories we hear over and over again from family members. They say that they question themselves. Could they have done more themselves to help their family member before they became addicted? The common theme from each of them is that you have to assume, when a doctor is giving you a bottle of pills for your family member, that it must be good for them. It must be good for them. It turns out that for 30,000 people in 2014, it wasn't good for them. This number is going to continue to escalate because we haven't put tough enough standards on the books in order to deal with these issues. By refusing to convene expert advisory boards to come in and to create the guidance which is going to be needed in our country going forward, we are going to have a continued flood of opioid deaths that could have been stemmed if we had dealt with this issue in the proper fashion. This is not a hypothetical concern. The policy announced last week by the FDA would not have guaranteed an advisory panel for OxyContin on the market today. The FDA must change its decision not to seek expert advice against the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids. I want to tell a little story. It is a story about one of maybe the five greatest basketball players ever to come out of the State of Massachusetts. His name is Chris Herren. Chris became a Boston Celtic. He was the greatest basketball player in Fall River history, was drafted in the first round by the NBA, and went to the same college I went to--Boston College. In an excerpt of remarks he recently made in DC at the Unite to Face Addiction rally on the National Mall, here is what Chris Herren said: [[Page S936]] I truly believe when it comes to prevention and educating our kids, we need to stop focusing on the worst days and start educating about the first day. At 18 years old, on the campus of Boston College I was introduced to cocaine. I promised myself one time--just one line. That one line took me 14 years to walk away from. Despite myself at 22, my dream came true. I was 33rd pick in the NBA draft, but that same year I was introduced to a little yellow pill--a 40 milligram OxyContin that cost a 20 dollar bill. That 40 milligrams turned into 1600 milligrams a day. And that 20 dollars became a $20,000-a-month Oxy habit. And just 2 years later, that pill turned into a needle and that needle stayed in my arm for the next 8 years. I often say if you can't find it in your heart to have empathy for someone who is battling their illness, then you must know that he or she has a mother, father, son or daughter that is at home with a broken heart that wants them back. Just one pill, lives impacted, some recover and many are lost. Another story--Kaitlyn Oberle from Scituate, MA. Here is what she says: I have survived a fatal opiate overdose, yet I never abused opiates. On November 13, 2015 I spoke to my 27-year-old brother for the last time. Less than 30 minutes after our final conversation, he passed away from an opiate overdose. He was only 16 years old when he first encountered the demon that consumed the better part of his adult life; sadly, that same demon ultimately killed him. Injuries from a dirt bike accident left him with two broken arms, a knee injury, and what felt like an unending supply of prescription opiate painkillers. After his bones mended, he was left with an untreated gaping open wound that would never fully heal itself: an opiate addiction. During my brother's recovery he painted a picture for me of how easy it was for him as a high school teenager and student athlete to call his doctor and request refills for his pain pill prescriptions. When he no longer had injuries to substantiate a prescription, he turned to illegal forms of opiates in both pill and intravenous form. Unfortunately, the damage to his brain had been done. There are many facets to what may cause someone to become addicted to opiates, and there are equally as many angles of attack before there is substantial progress to a viable solution. Mr. Senator, I am writing to you because I am a survivor. I've lived through my worst fear by knowing I can be a voice in helping prevent future deaths caused by opiate addiction. As you convene to debate the fitness of Dr. Robert Califf's nomination for head of the Food and Drug Administration, please ask the Senate to reflect on his time as deputy commissioner. As second in power at the FDA, he has had a chance to do something about these issues. It is time for a change in culture at that agency. A third letter--final letter written by Stephen Jesi, from Malden, MA: I am writing to you as a longtime Maldonian and a father of a 33-year-old daughter Stephenie who passed away on December 13, 2015 of a heroin overdose. Stephenie overdosed on Thursday, two days prior to her death and was released by the hospital at 11:39 p.m. on to the streets. We've experienced this first hand many times. Thank God for Chief Campanello of the Gloucester Police Department who picked up the phone, talked to us, talked to Stephenie, and assisted us in every way he could to get her into treatment. Everybody else just said sorry, there is nothing we can do. I believe that our medical community along with the pharmaceutical industry are grooming and developing drug addicts and putting them right into the hands of the cartels and the drug dealers. Way too many prescriptions are written for more narcotics than are necessary after surgeries with no follow up. Many of those who are predisposed to addiction, either by genetics or co-existing mental health issues, are easy prey for these drugs that begin as legally prescribed. Once they are addicted and can no longer afford the medically prescribed version of the medication they fall into illegal drugs and from there too often the addiction has taken control of their lives. The pharmaceutical industry along with our medical community has to prescribe these highly addictive narcotics much more carefully and offer less addictive medication whenever possible. Most patients take these narcotics for just a couple of days after the surgery but are provided a much longer supply where they can easily fall into the hands of the addict. Our legislators and government officials cannot be tied to the desires of the pharmaceutical lobbyists. This is the cry that is coming out from every community in America. Individuals are saying: How did this happen to my family? How could that accident with the broken leg or the back pain turn into an opioid overdose? How could it have happened? Well, it happened because the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry have not put the protections in place for us to be able to deal with it. Let me give you this number. This is a crazy number. It is a crazy number. Over the last 15, 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of prescription opioid pills that have been allowed to be sold in America. So I am just going to ask people who are listening to this, pick a number. How many 10 milligram prescription opioids were allowed to be made in America last year? Just pick a number. We have 300 million people in America. How many of these pills were allowed or given the permission to be made by pharmaceutical companies? Here is the answer-- 14 billion. May I say that again--14 billion opioid pills for our country. The numbers are out of control. The overprescribing is out of control. We have to find a way to dramatically reduce the amount of drugs that are being sold legally in our country. Before we even reach illegal, you have to start with legal. That is the problem because the Drug Enforcement Administration, the agency responsible for deciding how much each pharmaceutical company can manufacture each year, doesn't even announce how much each company is given permission to manufacture; instead they just announce the gross number of total opioid materials that can be put into pills in our country each year. Does anyone understand this in America, that that is the process? The FDA allows the company to sell it. Then it goes over to the DEA. Then the DEA picks a number of pills that can be sold, and then physicians are allowed to prescribe these pills, but this is the FDA's own number. Listen to this. The FDA asks for voluntary guidelines to be put together for physicians' education so they know what they are doing with these opioids. Pick a number in your brain as to how many physicians have voluntarily accepted medical education on the consequences of prescribing opioids. Pick a number. Here is the correct answer: 10 percent of physicians. That is it. On something that is so catastrophic, something that is creating an epidemic in our country, you would think this would be mandatory; that the medical associations at the State level, the national level had created some kind of mandatory education. It hasn't happened. Is it mandatory in medical schools across America that they receive education as to what the consequences are of prescribing opioids? Not at all. So who would think a physician would have to be trained in how to handle pain? I mean, a physician is only dealing with the issue all day long, every single day. You would think there would be some understanding then of what the consequences were of the medicines they were prescribing. No courses in medical school are mandated. No courses are mandated after you have graduated, you are practicing medicine, and now you are licensed by the DEA to prescribe opiates--no courses. So as we move forward on the legislation that is going to be coming out on the floor of the Senate, I intend to make an amendment--Senator Blumenthal and I tried to make it in the Judiciary Committee, and we are going to be making it on the Senate floor--requiring the Drug Enforcement Administration to require mandatory education for any physician who wants to prescribe these drugs. That is the minimum, the minimum that the medical profession should have to accept as a responsibility before they are allowed to prescribe these drugs. There is another amendment which I am working on with Senator Paul of Kentucky, and that is an amendment that is going to increase access to medication that can help people deal with their addictions. Again, that is a classic example of a Democrat and Republican working together on these issues. Senator Ayotte and I have an amendment that would create a Good Samaritan protection for any American, any family member who wants to apply Narcan to a family member or someone who has overdosed and would die in the absence of Narcan, the antidote, being applied to them. Senator Ayotte and I are working on that amendment. We are trying hard to find ways where, unfortunately, legislatively we can act. This should have happened at the agencies. This should have happened in the medical profession. We shouldn't be forced to debate this on the Senate floor, but it is absolutely, [[Page S937]] indispensably necessary for us to take this action. This is the epidemic of our time. The death rates now in the age group that is affected by this epidemic are now declining at the same rates as they did during the war in Vietnam. We haven't seen anything like this since the war in Vietnam in the death rates--30,000 people-- quadrupling in 14 years, escalating on a daily basis. It is time for the Senate to take real action on this issue so we can deal with it. In Boston, MA, we had a police chief who saw that something had gone wrong, Chief Campanello. He said that incarceration doesn't work and instead treatment should be substituted. So beginning last June, what Chief Campanello said in Gloucester, MA, was that if you come in and you are an addict, you have a problem, you come into the police station, bring your drugs with you, we are not going to arrest you, we are going to put you into treatment immediately--no arrests. Four hundred people have walked into that police station in Gloucester, MA, in just 8 months--400 people. By shifting the paradigm from arrests to treatment, 800 more people--800 total across the country--as city after city, town after town adopts this model, have now accepted that as a better route for them in their lives, to just turn themselves in at the local police stations. He has partnered with a man named John Rosenthal. John Rosenthal is an activist in our State, and he helps to fund this program. Last Wednesday night, tragically, John Rosenthal's own nephew, Nathan Huggins-Rosenthal, age 34, died of an overdose in Calgary, Canada. My heart goes out to the Rosenthal family because obviously they were committed to dealing with this issue, pioneering ways to have addicts be able to have a place they can go. Yet in John Rosenthal's own family, his nephew overdosed just last Wednesday night. As Senator Ayotte was saying, there is no neighborhood immunity. There is no family who is completely protected. This epidemic has been created by pharmaceutical companies, by physicians, by the agencies responsible to deal with it, and it is now time for us to put in place the protections which are needed to deal with it. Let me give you opioids 101 so you can understand how we get to this--what are opioids, how do they work, and why do they lead to heroin abuse. Here is how it works. It starts with a seed pod of the opium poppy. We get the morphine, a naturally occurring opiate pain reliever from that pod seed. The morphine interacts with so-called opioid receptors that are found in high concentrations in areas of the brain that control pain and emotions. Taking opiates can increase the levels of dopamine in the brain's reward areas and produce euphoria or a rush of pain relief and relaxation. In fact, morphine, which was first identified in the early 1800s is named after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. In 1895, the Bayer Corporation, Bayer Aspirin--the Bayer Corporation in Germany introduced a new cough suppressant marketed as a safer alternative to morphine. This new wonder drug was called heroin. In the 1920s, drug manufacturers began making fully synthetic analogs to morphine. They were called opioids. These drugs contain the same basic chemical framework as morphine, and they have exactly the same mechanism of action in the brain. They share common chemical features that allow them to buy into the brain's opioid receptors, and they all are considered highly addictive. These drugs vary widely in potency. That is the amount of the drug required to reach the same level of pain relief and sedation as morphine. OxyContin, for example, is 150 percent as strong as morphine. Heroin is also an opioid. They share the same fundamental chemical structure. Heroin binds to the very same receptors in the brain and produces the same euphoria and sedation, and heroin is plagued by the same addiction potential. Heroin is classified as a schedule I drug, the most dangerous class, because it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse and addiction. So this is the pathway between opioids and heroin and why that pathway is very short. It is all about the chemistry because OxyContin has the nearly identical molecular constitution as heroin. Over time, the brain, the receptors are saying: I need to have to continue to have that hit. Thus, we have this epidemic where 80 percent of all people in the United States who are dying from heroin overdoses started on prescription opioid drugs that had been prescribed by their physicians. Physicians should have to be educated. The FDA should have expert advisory panels that give the strongest possible guidance to the pharmaceutical companies. That is what is missing in this equation. It starts there. We need a debate on $1.1 billion for more treatment and more education, and we are going to have that debate on the Senate floor. These local families, these local groups, they are heroes, but heroes need help, and it is time for us to fund those programs in the same way we funded the Ebola crisis and the same way we are being asked to help to fund the Zika crisis. We have a crisis in America ourselves, but if we don't deal with the issue right from the beginning at the FDA, at the DEA, and at the AMA, we are not going to solve this problem. We are just putting medical facilities in place to deal with the consequences of having no policy. This is our great opportunity to have a debate in our country. I can't thank the Members enough for beginning to deal with this issue on a serious basis, but we can't be afraid of the pharmaceutical industry. We can't be afraid of the American Medical Association. We can't be afraid of the bureaucrats in these agencies who say: Oh, Mr. or Ms. Senator, we are the experts. You don't know what you are talking about. Well, just let me tell you this. The people of the United States don't trust the experts anymore in these agencies. They want more accountability. They want other experts to come in to check those experts, to ask the tough questions on behalf of the American people. That is why I have a hold on Dr. Robert Califf's nomination for the FDA, because right now the FDA is saying it is going to continue business as usual and that is just wrong. That is just plain wrong. It has to stop there. The signal must come from this administration. I thank all the Members for this discussion, for where we are today and where we are going to have to go in the months ahead, but I don't think we should end this year without a fundamental change that has taken place in our society in this relationship. I will just add one final issue, and that is the issue of how many pills, how many pills a doctor can prescribe initially to a patient. We are now debating that issue in the State of Massachusetts. Governor Baker has been saying it should only be 3 days' worth of pills. One of the counterproposals is 7 days of pills that can be used by the patient. I do know this. We have to start here because right now doctors are handing out bottles of 60 to patients who only need a week's worth or 3 days' worth. When you leave a dentist's office, you don't need 60 days' worth of pills for your wisdom teeth that have been removed. When you have some pain that you just got from playing a softball game and you have twisted your back, you don't need a bottle of 60 or 30. You might need a few pills for 3 days or 7 days, but you don't need the 60. Having that 60 in that medicine cabinet is the beginning of the problem. I thank Governor Baker for what he is doing on this issue. They haven't resolved it in Massachusetts. I think we have to debate that in the Halls of Congress as well. They are all related, how these pills get into the blood system of our country. Again, I thank all of the Members for their consideration of this issue. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S929-S937] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past weekend the Nation honored Justice Antonin Scalia, who was laid to rest after serving on the Supreme Court for nearly three decades. Marcelle and I were home in Vermont when we learned that Justice Scalia had passed. Frankly, we were stunned by the news. I did not often agree with Justice Scalia, but he was a brilliant jurist with a deep commitment to our country and to the Constitution, and we enjoyed his friendship for decades. He will be remembered as one of the most influential Justices in modern history. While his family and all should have had a chance to mourn his passing, I was shocked when, in the immediate wake of his death, Senate Republicans moved quickly to shut down the constitutionally mandated process to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court. Within hours of his death being announced, they declared they would oppose any effort to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice this year. I have served in this body longer than any Member here and I have heard some shocking things during that time, but I am surprised by the political crassness of these statements. Before a nominee had even been named, some Republicans reflexively decided to prematurely reject anyone--anyone--nominated by the President. This impulsive rush to judgment runs completely contrary to how this body has always treated nominees--always treated nominees--to the highest Court in the land. Republicans should not allow the hyper- partisan rhetoric of the campaign trail to trump one of the Senate's most important constitutional duties. I have talked to the President, and I know he will fulfill his constitutional duty. He will nominate an individual to bring the Supreme Court back to full strength, and of course he should. The President has already begun consulting with Members of both parties in Senate, but after a nomination has been made, we in the Senate should get to work and do our jobs--the jobs we were elected to do. I was all over my State of Vermont last week. The Vermonters I spoke with last week reflect Americans across the country who are tired of partisan political games that are chipping away at the foundation of our constitutional democracy. I heard this from both Republicans and Democrats in Vermont. As Oliver Goodenough, a law professor at Vermont Law School, wrote this weekend in the Rutland Herald, an extended Supreme Court vacancy caused by Senate inaction ``would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 21, 2016] Court Battle--Another Shutdown? (By Oliver R. Goodenough) Within hours of the announcement of Anton Scalia's death, one of our political parties was already trying to make points with the electorate about the process of picking his successor. At that evening's debate, the GOP presidential candidates advocated that the constitutional process should be suspended, either voluntarily by President Barack Obama or by purposeful inaction by the Senate. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, was just as speedy, trying to warn Obama off from acting on the mandate of Article II, Section 2, which charges the president with nominating a replacement for Justice Scalia and the Senate with providing its advice and consent on the president's choice. One can understand McConnell's disappointment. Appointments to the Supreme Court are for life, which means only resignation, impeachment or death will create a vacancy. In the somewhat ghoulish game of waiting for a slot on the closely divided Supreme Court to open up, the short-term expectations of mortality had been focused elsewhere--Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, in particular, has been a survivor of long-odds pancreatic cancer. So Republicans were brought up short by the death of a conservative hero, whose replacement could shift the balance of the court. The accidents of history will do that sometimes. The Constitution makes provision for what happens in such a case--in the kind of clear, unequivocal language that is the best target for Justice Scalia's vaunted originalism. The president nominates. The Senate, for its part, gives the qualifications of any nominee a serious vetting; it is not entitled to just ignore the nomination. Some reports have argued that such a course of process sabotage would create a ``constitutional crisis.'' This is probably an overstatement; it would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment. With nearly a year left in Obama's term, waiting for his successor to name the new justice in 2017 would remove the ninth voice from the court not just for the current yearly term but also for most of the following term as well, since the replacement would arrive in the spring and miss months of argument and deliberation. For the better part of a year, the vacancy would sit like a broken tooth in the operations of the court. Close cases would often end up tied, with the result that the lower court finding would remain the binding result. Not itself a disaster, but a result that the constitutional provisions for naming a successor are designed to avoid. The embarrassment of sabotage on judicial appointments actually already exists: Republicans in the Senate have effectively shut down the process of nominating new judges for the federal courts of appeal. The blockage isn't over qualifications--such considerations would be a proper exercise of the Senate's confirmation role, raised in committee and on the Senate floor Rather, the nominations are sitting in a limbo of inaction: It is simply a matter of not doing the job at all. This is the real crisis, a state of politics where Republicans in the House and Senate are willing to derail the processes of government to thwart the actions of President Obama, good, bad or indifferent. The most obvious example was the full shutdown of government. Limited shutdowns on matters like judicial appointments are parts of the same pattern. Of course, obstructionism is not just a Republican failing, and it can be present in both parties to some degree in the spicy stew of politics in our robust democracy. But the bottom-line commitment of all parties should be to maintaining a functioning government, structured and administered in accordance with the framework set out in our Constitution, even when it is not working to their advantage. Why is this so hard for at least some Republicans to buy into? Why the willingness, indeed eagerness, to bring down the house we all live in? The key is a widespread denial among Republicans of the legitimacy of the Obama presidency. This is partly related to the man himself--all the blather about his birth, his religion, etc. While many Americans find it a vindication that we can elect an African-American to our highest office, for some it is an impossibility which in turn justifies the most extreme forms of resistance. Race is our original sin as a country, and its legacy haunts us still. Republicans are also in denial over changes in the social and economic fabric of America. We are, as always, in the process of moving from what America has been to what it will be. Conservatives have a role to play, reminding us of the valuable parts of where we came from. Progressives have a role, recognizing the imperatives of the future and charting the paths of change toward positive outcomes. Politics is the sometimes rough and tumble playing field where the dialog on this goes forward. The intransigence of shutdowns, however, whether of the full government or a critical aspect like the nomination process, exceeds the boundaries of acceptable play and hurts us all. Obama needs to make a good faith nomination to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate majority need to review it in good faith. That is what the Constitution provides; that is what the country needs. Get on with it. Mr. LEAHY. We must not let that dysfunction infect the Supreme Court, an independent, coequal branch of government that was designed to be above politics. The next nominee to the Supreme Court deserves full and fair consideration by the Senate. This includes a timely hearing and then having an up-or-down vote. I am worried that even before President Obama took office, and ever since then--even after he was reelected by a 5 million-vote plurality-- there has been an unrelenting and cynical campaign by some hyper- partisans to delegitimize the President's authority. There were the birthers, and there have been and still are spurious slurs of all kinds. Outside of this body, the efforts to undermine President Obama's constitutional authority to fill this Supreme Court vacancy draws some of their vehemence and venom from these dark corners. But every one of us took an oath of office--every one of us--and we [[Page S930]] are sworn to uphold our constitutional duties. Let us not be intimidated and pressured to avoid our sworn duty. Let us act for the good of the American people and for the good of this great Nation. Some have justified their call for unprecedented obstruction by claiming it is because the American people need a voice. Give me a break. The American people have spoken--millions of Americans--and an overwhelming majority of Vermonters voted in record numbers in 2008 and again in 2012 to elect President Obama. In doing so, they granted him constitutional authorities for all 8 years of those two terms. A President isn't elected for 1 year or 2 years or 3 years. A President is elected for 4 years at a time. Just saying that President Obama is a ``lame duck'' President does not make it true. In fact, the next election is not until November. The American people expect those they elected to do their jobs for their entire term. That means both in the Senate and in the White House. They don't expect Senators to say: Well, we can't vote on anything this year because it is an election year. We will collect our full salary, but we are not going to vote on anything. The American people don't like that. It is rare that a vacancy in the Supreme Court arises during an election year, but it is just false to say Justices do not get confirmed in Presidential election years. More than a dozen Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in a Presidential election year. The Democrats led the Senate during President Reagan's final year in office, and we voted. President Reagan's nominee was confirmed by a Democratic-led Senate during the President's final year in office. He received a hearing and a confirmation vote. It would be the height of hypocrisy to say we shouldn't apply the same process with a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in control of the Senate. We can't say that we will follow our constitutional duties and do our work if we have a Democratic-controlled Senate and a Republican President but we can't do it if it is the other way around. Some Republican Senators have acknowledged that the next Supreme Court nominee should receive a fair hearing. But the process can't end there. I have served on the Judiciary Committee for 36 years. During my time on the committee, we have never refused to send a Supreme Court nominee to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. Even in those cases where a majority of the committee had opposed the nomination, we still reported the nominee to the full Senate. Once reported to the full Senate, every Supreme Court nominee has received an up-or-down confirmation vote during my 40 years in the Senate. We have to uphold this bipartisan tradition for the next Supreme Court nominee because so much is at stake. Merely holding a hearing without full committee process and a confirmation vote is insufficient for a Supreme Court nominee. It would be a charade, and it would be an avoidance of our constitutional duties. If Republicans refuse to uphold their constitutional responsibility to consider the next Supreme Court nominee, I believe it will harm our constitutional system of government. If they succeed in deliberately holding open a seat on the Supreme Court for more than a year, they will be intentionally disabling the Court's ability to fulfill its constitutional role, and Republicans will be harming the Supreme Court for more than a year. Justice Scalia once wrote that a Supreme Court of just eight Justices risked the possibility the Court ``will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.'' The legal issues before the Supreme Court are significant, and the importance of a single vote on the Court cannot be overstated. One vote on the Supreme Court decided landmark cases concerning our campaign finance laws, clean water and air policies, marriage equality, and voting rights. Americans deserve a fully functioning Supreme Court. I have traveled all over my State. I have traveled all over this country. I have talked to Republicans and Democrats alike. What I know about my fellow Americans that makes me so proud is that they show up for work and they do their jobs. Americans don't have the luxury of telling their bosses that instead of doing their job, they would rather delay, delay, delay. If they did, they would probably be fired. The U.S. Senate shouldn't tell the American people that we are not going to do our jobs; that we will delay, delay, delay. The stakes are too high. The American people actually expect us to show up for work and do our job. Let's get to work, do the job the American people sent us here to do. And we may want to reread our oath to uphold the Constitution. It requires no less. Mr. President, I don't see others on the floor about to speak. I will yield the floor when I do. We have allowed this whole process to become far too partisan. I am a lawyer, a former prosecutor. I have argued cases in the State court, Federal courts, Federal trial courts, and Federal appellate courts. When I have gone to the Federal courts, I have always thought that the beauty of this--whether Republican or Democratic nominees--is that I could get a fair hearing. I thought it was a great honor to go there. People come from other parts of the world, and they talk about our Federal judiciary as an example for them. I recall that when a country that had been under dictatorship changed to a more democratic form of government, some of their people came to my office and asked about our judicial system. They said: Is it true that in the United States of America, people can actually sue their government? I said: That is true. It happens all the time. They said: Well, is it true that sometimes the government loses? I said: It happens all the time. They said: Well, do you replace the judge when that happens? I said: No. They are independent. It was like a lightbulb went on. They realized how different we are. Think of the image we send to the rest of the world--as well as 300 million Americans--if we say: No, we are going to politicize the Supreme Court, the Court that is supposed to be the final arbiter on constitutional questions. Look at what it says to them if we say: Yes, we have time to take more recesses this year than I think the Senate ever has, that I can ever remember, but we don't have time to do the job we were elected to do, the job we are paid to do--have a hearing on and vote on a Supreme Court nominee. The American people have jobs. They can't pick and choose when they will bother to show up. They can't say ``I know this is what I am supposed to do in this job, but I don't feel like it'' or ``I have a partisan reason not to do it. I am going to sit this out. See me next year, and I may do my job.'' Nobody would accept that. But that is really what is happening. The Republican leadership is saying ``No, we want to sit this out. We don't want to do our work. We don't want to do our job. See us next year, and maybe we will then.'' That has never happened. It never happened during an election year. There have been at least a dozen Supreme Court vacancies during an election year, and a dozen times the Senate, no matter who was President, came together and handled the nominee and got them confirmed. Why did Senators do that in the past? Probably because they figured they had been elected, they were being paid by the American people, it was part of their job, and so they showed up and did their job. Are we now going to change what has been the precedent ever since the beginning of this country and say ``Oh, we are better than that. We don't have to do our job. Keep paying us, but we don't have to do our job even though we have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and do our job''? Even Justice Scalia said that would be wrong, that you shouldn't have an eight-member Supreme Court. And we don't. Let's actually show up and do the job we were elected to do, do the job we are paid to do. Let's do what every other American has to do. They have to show up for work. They have to do their jobs. They can't say ``I don't feel like it this year. I will see you next year. Oh, by the way, send me my paycheck.'' That is not the American way; it should not be the Senate way. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S931]] Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today first to praise and echo the words of the senior Senator from Vermont, our ranking member on Judiciary, in urging our Republican colleagues to give a fair and full consideration of a Supreme Court nominee. I particularly wish to praise my friend, the ranking member, for his eloquent remarks and for his leadership of the committee when he was chair and as ranking member. My friend from Vermont is absolutely right. Just as the President has a constitutional responsibility to name a nominee to the Court, the Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on that nominee. Frankly, it is the Senate's job to consider Supreme Court nominees, and the American people expect the Senate to do its job. We are telling Senate Republicans, America is telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. Plain and simple. My friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, should commit to holding hearings. The distinguished majority leader should commit to holding a vote. It has been a longstanding precedent of the Senate to consider Supreme Court nominees in a timely manner, even in election years: Justice Pitney in 1912; Brandeis and Clarke in 1916; Cardozo at a time when America was even more divided than now, 1932. In the middle of the Depression, the great election between Roosevelt and Hoover, they put in Cardozo in that last year. Murphy in 1940 and Kennedy in 1988 were confirmed. Justice Kennedy was confirmed in the last year of a Presidency with a Republican in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate. That is the mirror image and the most recent chance we have to compare how Democrats were acting, how Republicans were acting. All of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who were here voted that way. I know today our Republican colleagues point to what Senator Biden said. They have pointed to what Chairman Leahy said. They have pointed to what I and other Democrats have said. There are equal quotations that Senator McConnell, Senator Grassley, and others have said, each voicing a different view than maybe is being voiced today. But none of those were held up. You can have all the competing quotes you want; they amount to nothing. The American people are strong--Democrats and Republicans--in telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. The bottom line is very simple. To say that there will be no hearing, no vote, no consideration whatsoever even before a nominee is named to a vacancy, that is not doing your job; that is quitting before you start. Senator Leahy said it well. Imagine someone showing up at work. Imagine if an average American showed up at work and said: I am going to take a year off, but you still have to pay me. Your boss wouldn't stand for it. Well, our boss, the American people, will not stand for this because it will take over 300 days before a Supreme Court nominee is filled, at best. The kind of knee-jerk political obstruction the American people have grown so frustrated with in the Congress is what our Republican colleagues are saying. If Republicans truly respect the Constitution, they should follow it and consider a nomination from the sitting President rather than playing political games. Instead, they are once again threatening to bow to the most extreme rightwing voices and engage in the kind of political obstruction that brought us a 3-week government shutdown that cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and took $15 to $20 billion out of the economy. In 2013, after the hard right didn't get its way in its fight to undo the Affordable Care Act, they waged a war to shut down the government. Republican leaders listened. They probably knew it was wrong in their heads, but they listened. What happened? After 3 weeks with their tails between their legs, the leadership had to say we have to open up the government even though we haven't repealed the Affordable Care Act. The now-junior Senator from Texas had urged that course, and they were foolhardy to follow. The junior Senator from Texas is now urging the course of having no hearings and no votes. I tell my Republican colleagues--and to his credit, Senator McConnell said we have to get the Senate working again--that this is a foolhardy course, and it will not stand. It will not last because the American people are telling Senate Republicans: Do your job. Republicans say the American people should have a voice in choosing a Supreme Court Justice. Well, guess what. President Obama won reelection by a large margin in 2012. Many of the issues they bring up now were there then, such as security and the Affordable Care Act. There was a referendum on all these kinds of things. The people spoke loudly and clearly on November 6, 2012, when they elected the President to another 4-year term. That is 4 years, as called for in the Constitution, not 3 years, as some of my Republican friends like to say now. If Republicans get their way, we would have a 4-to-4 gridlocked Supreme Court for a year that would tie the Court and large parts of the country in knots. Let me say, if we have a tie in the Supreme Court decision, the decision has no Presidential value. You get gridlock and confusion. America doesn't want gridlock. They don't want gridlock on the floor of the Senate, they don't want gridlock on the floor of the House, and they don't want gridlock in the Supreme Court. The American people expect the Senate to do its job. They are tired of obstruction and ``my way or the highway'' politics. Again I say that our friend, the junior Senator from Texas, likes to quote the Constitution. He likes to walk around carrying the Constitution. That is great. I am all for that. I would like him to show me the lines in the Constitution that say in the last year of the President's term, he doesn't have the power or the right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice. Of course he does. Yet the Republican majority-- at least by its stance now--is taking away that right because they will not even have a hearing. Some people say: Well, they will just vote no after the hearing. Maybe yes, maybe no. I believe every Member has the right to vote no if they think the nominee is out of the mainstream, and I will be the first to admit mainstream is defined differently by different people. But hearings are amazing things. If the candidate is being open and honest, hearings help us to get to know the candidate better. Whatever one thinks of hearings, the last four nominees of the Supreme Court-- two under President Bush, two under President Obama--got bipartisan votes and passed. This idea of not having a vote is wrong. For the sake of our Constitution and for the sake of getting our country moving again, I urge and plead with my colleagues on the other side to do their job. That is what the American people want, plain and simple. It is time for the Senate to do its job. Once the President nominates someone, we need to have hearings with our Republican colleagues in a careful and thoughtful way. They don't have to rush a nominee through-- no dilatory tactics--and then there should be a vote. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia and Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on February 13 the Nation was shaken by the news that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away. Justice Scalia served on the Nation's highest Court for 29 years, and he was a major figure on the American legal landscape. Justice Scalia was described by Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit as ``the most influential justice of the last quarter century.'' Over the years I came to know Justice Scalia. He was a man of great intellect, good humor, and he was a very social person. We certainly disagreed on many fundamental issues, but even those who disagreed with Justice Scalia on legal matters still admired him as a person. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--no ideological ally of Justice Scalia-- wrote [[Page S932]] after his death, ``we were best buddies.'' She described him as ``a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit, with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh.'' Justice Ginsberg said she and Justice Scalia were ``different in our interpretation of written texts,'' but they were ``one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.'' I have great respect for the decades Justice Scalia spent in public service. My thoughts and prayers clearly go with his family. As surprised as I was by the news of Justice Scalia's passing, I was amazed at how quickly the Senate majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, issued a press release saying, ``this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.'' His statement came out within 90 minutes of the press report of the Justice passing. This statement clearly came at a time when most people reflected on the loss of the Supreme Court Justice, and just like that, the conversation shifted from the passing of an American legal giant to an attack on President Obama's authority to fill his vacancy on the Supreme Court. What does the Constitution tell us about filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court? There are very few oaths a person takes in their life. As Members of the Senate, we swear each time we are reelected to a new term to uphold and defend that Constitution. What does the Constitution say about a vacancy on the Supreme Court? If you go to article II, section 2, it is explicit and very simple. The President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court.'' The President, under the Constitution, has an express responsibility to submit to the Senate the nomination of a person who is qualified to serve on our Nation's highest Court. Then, of course, the Senate has a job to do: Give that nominee a fair hearing and a timely vote. This is our constitutional responsibility as U.S. Senators. This is what we have been elected to do. Aside from voting on a declaration of war, I believe there is no greater responsibility than voting on the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. I serve on the Judiciary Committee, and it has been my privilege and honor to consider the nominations of four of the current Supreme Court Justices. There is no question that we have the time remaining to meet our constitutional responsibility in a thoughtful and careful way. It is now February of 2016. We are almost a year away from January of 2017 when President Obama will officially leave office. The Republican leader would have us leave a seat on the Nation's highest Court vacant for at least 1 year. Not since the Civil War has the Senate taken longer than a year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, and it certainly shouldn't happen now. Usually it takes the Senate about 2 months to consider a Supreme Court nominee. Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said that on average it takes about 67 days. So we have more than enough time to do this in a thoughtful and responsible way. Even during Presidential election years, the Senate has routinely confirmed Supreme Court Justices. It has happened over a dozen times, most recently in 1988, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed by a 97-to-0 vote during President Reagan's final year in office. President Reagan--a Republican President about to leave office--submitted a name, Justice Kennedy, to the Supreme Court, and a Democratic-controlled Senate approved it with a vote of 97 to nothing. So to argue that this has never happened before is to ignore history, and even recent history. In the past, Senate Republican leaders have said that the confirmation process should move forward with as little time as a month before an election. Consider the Presidential election of 1968. On June 13 of that year, Chief Justice Earl Warren informed the President he wanted to step down. On June 26 of the election year, Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to become Chief Justice and nominated George Homer Thornberry to fill his seat. President Johnson had already announced he would not run again, but Senate Republican leaders did not call President Johnson a lame duck and question his right to put forward nominees. In fact, Senate Republican leader Everett Dirksen of my State of Illinois said on July 13 of that year, ``I find that term `lame duck' as applied to the President of the United States as an entirely improper and offensive term.'' Republican Senator Dirksen was referring to the lame duck status of President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat. The Senate gave the President's nominee a prompt hearing in the Judiciary Committee. As it turned out, the hearing uncovered a range of ethics concerns about Justice Fortas, and in late September and early October, Senate Republicans filibustered his nomination. Fortas subsequently withdrew. But on October 3--same election year, just a month before the election--the New York Times reported that ``Senator Dirksen said there was still time for the President to submit a new name and rush it through the Senate before the Congress adjourned.'' The Republican leader said that even with a month left, we should try to fill the vacant seat. This was a month before the Presidential election. Where are the leaders like Everett Dirksen in today's Republican Party, Senators who are willing to roll up their sleeves and get down to the work of considering the nominees on their merits so the Supreme Court can do its work? We have a constitutional responsibility, as does the President. Make no mistake--the Supreme Court needs a full complement of Justices on the bench. When the Court has an even number, as it does today, four to four, important cases are increasingly likely to end up in a tie vote. When that happens in a case, the ruling of the lower court stands and it is as if the Supreme Court never heard the case at all. Major legal and constitutional questions are constantly brought before the Court. When the Court is frozen at an even number of Justices, many of those questions go unresolved and millions of Americans who are impacted by these questions have to wait. That is not fair to the American people. That is why historically the Senate moved to fill vacancies of the Court. That is why so many Americans are troubled by Senate Republicans' call for a 1-year hiatus in filling the Supreme Court vacancy. Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said in an interview last week that she disagreed with the idea of waiting for the next President to appoint a new Justice. Justice O'Connor said, ``We need somebody there now to do the job. Let's get on with it.'' I agree with Justice O'Connor. When President Obama submits a nominee, which he will do in coming days, the Senate needs to do its job, its constitutional responsibility, and give that nominee a fair hearing and timely vote. My Republican colleagues can choose to vote for or against the nominee. That is their prerogative. They should not simply duck the vote. We were not elected to this job to ignore important issues; we were elected to cast votes on important issues. This is too important an issue to simply ignore. When it comes to giving the President's nominee a fair hearing, I certainly hope Senate Republicans don't adopt the Donald Trump position. When asked about the President's nomination, Mr. Trump, as he is wont to do, gave us a juicy quote. Here is what he said: ``I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it--it's called delay, delay, delay.'' I am sure the Senate Republicans were not happy with that statement by Trump, but he did speak for a number of people who believe that is the right strategy: stop the President from using his constitutional authority; stop the Senate from accepting its constitutional responsibility. I hope my Republican colleagues don't follow Mr. Trump's lead and try to stop President Obama's nominee through endless delays. No one is going to be fooled if Senate Republicans spend weeks haggling over unreasonable document requests or swamping the nominee with endless written questions. Mr. Trump has already made it clear that ``delay, delay, delay'' is simply a strategy to stop the seat from being filled. If Republicans delay in an effort to run out the clock, we will know it, and the American people will know it. The American people want us to act. They want us to accept our constitutional [[Page S933]] responsibility. It is time for us to get down to work and do our job. The Senate can't afford to sit on its hands for 1 year and leave the Supreme Court hanging in the balance. When President Obama names a nominee, I urge my Republican colleagues to give that person a fair hearing and timely vote. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING CHAIR. The Senator from New Hampshire. Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my serious concerns with the FDA's actions on opioid pain relievers and my concern that they have not sufficiently addressed what we are seeing as an epidemic in my home State of New Hampshire. The implications of prescribing opioids and ensuring that we take a very strong public health approach toward these pain relievers is important. I know my that my colleagues--Senators Markey, Manchin, and Blumenthal--have been on the floor previously to discuss the concerns they share about the FDA as well. I thank them for their leadership on this important issue. I think what is important to understand here is what we are facing when it comes to heroin, the drug deaths that are occurring in my home State of New Hampshire, the connection between people who are misusing prescription opioids and then becoming addicted to heroin, and the deadly use of a drug called fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. When we bring this all together, we have a situation with opioid abuse which includes painkiller abuse, heroin use, fentanyl abuse, and it is killing people in New Hampshire and across this country. Across this country, approximately 30,000 people died of heroin or prescription opioid overdoses in 2014. As we come to receive the 2015 numbers, unfortunately, if the experience is anything like my home State of New Hampshire, the numbers are going to be much larger than 30,000 because in New Hampshire, every corner of my State has been impacted by this. I had the privilege of serving as attorney general before I came to the Senate, and I dealt with many drug issues as attorney general. In fact, I had a drug task force that reported to me. We dealt with the surge of methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illegal drugs that certainly have caused addiction and people to struggle with addiction. Obviously, alcohol is also something people struggle with when it is misused, but I have never seen anything like this. I talk to my law enforcement officers and I talk to my first responders about what they are dealing with. In 2015, in New Hampshire, we had over 400 overdose deaths, and those 400 deaths were situations where there was a combination--many of them, hundreds of them--of heroin and/or fentanyl. And that was a dramatic increase over 2014. In 2014, we had 320 deaths. And by the way, that is a 60-percent increase from the year before. Unfortunately, this is not stopping. It is the single most important public health and safety issue facing the State of New Hampshire right now, but I know New Hampshire is not alone. Certainly working with my colleague Rob Portman from Ohio, I know this is hitting Ohio. Working with Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island, I know this is hitting Rhode Island. Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota--this is hitting so many different places in our country. That is why I know Senator Markey from Massachusetts is concerned about this and Senator Manchin from West Virginia, who was on the floor earlier. This is about our quality of life in this country and the ability for people to live full lives and about our public safety and about our children most of all. The headline from the Union Leader over this weekend: ``Fentanyl, other drugs suspected in three Manchester deaths.'' So we had three deaths in New Hampshire, in our largest city, within 24 hours, and those three deaths were from a combination of heroin and fentanyl. According to Assistant Fire Chief Daniel Goonan, in just 24 hours in Manchester, these overdoses claimed the lives of a 23-year-old man, a 29-year-old woman, and a 34-year-old man. That was in just a 24-hour period. In fact, what our first responders are seeing--I did a ride-along with the Manchester fire department. I was there less than an hour. We went to an overdose, and I saw the firefighters and their emergency personnel bring someone back to life using CPR and Narcan. If we did not have that drug, the over 400 we had in New Hampshire--I can't even tell you what the numbers would be, because not only did I do a ride- along with the Manchester fire department, I did one with the police, too, and we went to two overdoses in an hour and a half, and I saw them bring those individuals back to life. But lest we think this is something that happens on some other street or in some other neighborhood, I can assure you that this can happen to any family, and that is something we need to understand. That was really brought home for me from a wonderful family I met, Doug and Pam Griffin, who lost their beautiful daughter Courtney. They are wonderful people. I think about what our first responders are facing. This same article I just talked about, over the weekend--unbelievable. Twice the fire department in Manchester revived a woman who was 4 months pregnant, working on her in front of her young children. I will never forget the overdose I went to. The firefighters came into the room, and there was a young man on the ground. They administered the Narcan and brought him back. But do you know what was in the corner? A crib with a baby in it. The firefighter grabbed the baby and was bringing the baby over. The father was lying on the ground. So this is having a tremendous impact on not only those who are struggling with addiction but also their families and the children around them and the future generations. In this article, the assistant fire chief from Manchester basically said: It is more deadly than we have ever seen. So that is why I have been proud to work with my colleagues, proud to work with Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Klobuchar, and so many others on the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act. I thank the members of the Judiciary Committee for voting that important piece of legislation out of the committee, and I look forward to us taking that up on the floor. Right now pending on the floor, we have an important nomination for the FDA. That is why I come to the floor today, because if you look at what we are addressing here, we are concerned about heroin and fentanyl, but there is a very important connection for us to understand, unfortunately, and it is also why I have been such a strong supporter of prescription-monitoring programs. The opiates that are prescribed--SAMHSA has found that four out of five individuals who turned to heroin actually started with prescription opiates and misusing prescription opiates or overusing those and then transitioning to heroin because heroin is cheaper, unfortunately, on our streets. So it is very important that we have the FDA engaging on this issue very aggressively with our medical community, that the FDA take a prominent role in ensuring that what they are saying is, this is the appropriate use of prescription opiates. In my humble opinion, the FDA needs to take a much more aggressive role than it has in recommending the appropriate uses and engaging the medical community and the pharmaceutical community, very importantly, on this discussion, this public health crisis we are facing. We have come together as a body on this issue, and I think it is important that we have been working on this in a very bipartisan basis. But just to talk about the importance of the FDA and the leadership we need there, in 2013 we saw the FDA approve Zohydro--a powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation, and an abuse- deterrent formulation is important so that it will be used for its intended purpose and not chopped up or otherwise abused. Yet the FDA approves Zohydro--this powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation despite the fact that its own advisory committee voted against approving the drug by a vote of 11 to 2. I see Senator Markey coming to the floor, and I appreciate his leadership on this. One of the things that I know have troubled Senator Markey, Senator Manchin, and me as well is that last year the FDA approved OxyContin [[Page S934]] for use by children as young as 11, and when they did that, they did not have an advisory committee or use an advisory committee before taking that step. So I would say that I certainly appreciate that I had the opportunity to sit down with Secretary Burwell on this issue and learn more about the FDA's action plan that it issued, but unfortunately I believe the agency has to go further than it is going. The example I would use is the issuance of the recommendations for the children as young as 11 with OxyContin, without an advisory committee on something so important, seems--to me, it just doesn't pass the commonsense test. So I would recommend to the FDA, let's make sure we have an advisory committee look at this issue carefully and then reissue a recommendation, because to me it seems important that we have that guidance and the careful, thoughtful approach of the advisory committee. Of course, what troubles me is we hope they would take the advisory committee's recommendations, unlike what happened with Zohydro, unfortunately. So we need leadership right now in the FDA. I have concerns that we are not going to be in a position where we get the strongest leadership we can have. We have a nominee pending on the floor. These concerns are very important. I hope, if he is confirmed, he will be aggressive on this issue and that the FDA will take a stronger leadership role on opiates, understanding that they have a very important role when it comes to this public health concern. Right now I am not satisfied with where we are. I believe there is so much more we need to do. That is actually why yesterday I voted to not go forward with this nomination, because I haven't heard this clear statement, I haven't heard what the leadership plans are on this issue. While I appreciate some of the steps the Department of Health and Human Services has taken, those steps to me need to be very much strengthened. As I look at the FDA's action plan, it pledges to make the use of advisory committees more frequent, but it should require the use of advisory committees for all opioid pain relievers, not just when we decide we want to use it. This should be consistent, given that we unfortunately know that the data is there on the connection between misuse of opioid pain relievers and the connection to those who unfortunately then turn to heroin, with the deadly combination of fentanyl, which is killing people in this country. Again, I wish to thank Senator Markey for his leadership on this issue. There isn't a place I go in my State where I don't hear from a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a grandmother, a grandfather, a friend about someone who lost a loved one, lost someone they care about, because of heroin, opioids, fentanyl, the deadly combination that is killing people. We have an opportunity, not only with the important work in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to add more resources to address prevention, treatment, and support for our first responders but also the FDA has a very important role, and we need stronger leadership there and greater engagement of our medical community on the best prescribing practices for opioids. To me, this is an opportunity where I would like to see stronger leadership and I would like to hear a much more aggressive stance from this FDA. Of all the issues we struggle with, the things we disagree on in this body--heroin, fentanyl, they don't care whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, I can assure my colleagues, or an Independent or a Libertarian because these drugs are taking everyone's lives. So as I think about all the issues we can come together on, this is one about our public health, about our public safety, about our quality of life, and it requires all of our leadership. There is nothing partisan about this. I hope we will see stronger leadership from the FDA. I hope we as a body will build on what the Judiciary Committee did and bring to the floor the CARA bill that many of us have worked hard on and support each other's efforts to do all we can to end this public health crisis and ensure that none of us have to run into families of people in our State whom we represent who are losing people they love to heroin or fentanyl or misuse of opioid prescription drugs. This is devastating. I know we can make a difference. This is something we can make a difference on in this body. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to follow on with the discussion that Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire was bringing to the Senate floor. What she is saying is just so accurate in terms of the pervasive nature of this opioid-driven epidemic--pandemic--in the United States of America. It is time for us to come together in a bipartisan fashion to deal with what is now the great medical storm sweeping across this country. There has been a quadrupling of opioid-related deaths in just the last 14 years in our country. This is something that has to be understood. I heard Senator Ayotte mention it, but we can't say it enough: 80 percent of all people in the United States who die from heroin overdoses begin with prescription painkillers--opioids--that have been given to them by physicians. Let me say that again. Eighty percent of the people who die from heroin overdoses started on prescription pills. They got addicted to the prescription painkiller. It deals with the same receptors in the brain. It creates the same kind of need in the brain, and when people get addicted to prescription pain medicine, it is ultimately a very short to a product which is much less expensive--heroin--on the streets of the United States. This epidemic has to be dealt with and it has to be dealt with where it starts and it starts at the FDA. It starts at the Food and Drug Administration. It starts with the agency that approves these drugs for sale in the United States of America. Yes, the FDA stands for Food and Drug Administration, but over the last 20 years it really stands for ``Fostering Drug Addiction,'' and it has to end. This is why the nomination right now of Dr. Robert Califf to be the new head of the FDA gives us an opportunity to talk about this issue, to talk about where it all starts, how it began, and what we are going to have to do in this body to reverse this trend, which last year led to the deaths of 30,000 people in our country. Again, I say to my colleagues that between 2000 and 2014, the heroin overdose death rate has quadrupled in the United States of America. This is something that is recent. It is related to the FDA, and we have to now have an honest discussion about the role that agency is playing because we have become the ``United States of Oxy.'' We have become a nation of 5 percent of the world's population that consumes 80 percent of the prescription painkillers in the world. This overprescribing, this consumption of Oxy and Percocet, down the line has led to this epidemic, this contagion that is killing people on a daily basis in our country who otherwise would never have even contemplated using heroin or using any of these other more dangerous drugs. That is why we are here. That is why I am recommending a ``no'' vote on Dr. Robert Califf. The FDA has a chance to change its policies. Thus far, it is saying it will not change its policies. In 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers. That is enough for every single adult in America to have a bottle of these pills in their medicine cabinet. We should understand as we talk about this that the molecular composition of OxyContin is very similar to heroin. In fact, Oxycodone is the sole ingredient in OxyContin. OxyContin stands for oxycodone continuously in the bloodstream of the patient who is taking these pills. It creates this sense that you are able to deal with the pain. It creates this sense that you are being taken care of, but if it is not handled correctly over time, it then creates an addiction, and that addiction then leads to, once you are off these pills, to being out on the street buying the heroin or buying the Oxy you need in order to continue this habit. So we have to start to deal with the issue very realistically in terms of this pathway that has been created into the minds of millions of people all across this country. Thirteen hundred people died in Massachusetts in 2014, of the 30,000 people [[Page S935]] in our country, as a result of this issue. We have the FDA, going back to the year 1996, accepting the misrepresentation of the pharmaceutical company Purdue, which represented to the FDA that OxyContin, in its original formulation, was abuse deterrent, meaning that since it was time-released inside of the patient, that, therefore, it was abuse deterrent and it could be prescribed safely to people all across our country. Well, it turned out that not only was that a misrepresentation to the FDA, but Purdue Pharma subsequently was fined millions of dollars and its executives punished for the misrepresentation they made to the Food and Drug Administration. That was a brief 20 years ago, but that is pretty much where it all started. That is the original sin--accepting this whole notion of abuse deterrent. Let's go to the FDA in more recent times. In 2012, there was a new opioid that the FDA had to consider for approval. That new opioid's name is Zohydro. The FDA impaneled 13 experts to examine that drug for the FDA. When those 13 experts concluded their examination of the drug by an 11-to-2 vote, the expert advisory panel voted, no, do not allow this new Zohydro drug out on to the marketplace. They said the standards for abuse are too low. The standards to deal with addiction are too low. The standards to deal with a diversion of the drug are too low. What did the FDA do in 2012? It approved Zohydro for sale in the United States over the objections of the advisory panel that had voted 11 to 2 against it--and these are experts. Moving forward, the FDA decided to reexamine what it was going to do. So when it was considering Targiniq, when it was considering Hysinla, it decided to solve the problem by having no expert advisory panels which it would convene to examine the impacts of that drug before it got approved. That is a good way to solve the problem--just accept the representations of the company that it had abuse deterrent in it, and then you don't have to worry because you will not have to talk to experts on the outside again. So those two drugs got approved. Then, in August of 2015, there was an application by Purdue Pharma, once again--that company's name just keeps coming back into the equation--they wanted approval to sell OxyContin to children ages 11 to 16. Now mind you, the actual standards at the FDA require an outside expert panel to look at approval for opioids being sold in America if it is controversial, if it could have a huge social impact in our society. And it specifically says in the FDA's own guidelines that if pediatric doses--if the proper dose for a child is involved--then the FDA should have an expert panel. What did the FDA do? The FDA decided no expert panel would examine the appropriateness of OxyContin being prescribed for children ages 11 to 16 in our country--no expert advisory panel, which brings us to the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf. We are now in a process where we are examining his nomination and his qualifications. This Senator leaves aside his own personal qualifications. This is not a debate, really, over Dr. Califf. It is a debate over the agency because the agency is saying--even today as we will be voting on Dr. Califf's nomination--they will not change. They will not convene expert outside advisory panels to look at this new generation of opioids with abuse deterrents built into them to determine whether or not they are actually appropriately being put into our society. Today is the day to begin this debate. This nomination is the occasion that we can use in order to debate what has gone wrong at the Food and Drug Administration. If we don't start with a brandnew definition that gets created for abuse, for addiction, for what the standards should be for the use of these opioids, then this issue is just going to escalate until we are losing a Vietnam war's number of people every single year in the United States. This is a pharmaceutical industry-created problem. This is a physician-created problem. This is an FDA-created problem. It is created by men and women, and it can be solved by men and women. This is not Zika, this is not Ebola, and this is not some disease that you can't really point to that is responsible. This is us, this is our country, and this is our culture. We did it. We created this problem. We are 5 percent of the world's population consuming 80 percent of all opioids--crazy. Really, it is crazy. We have to finally come to the recognition that this is no longer some inner city heroin epidemic. This disease knows no barrier--racial, income, geography, employment--no barriers at all. It is spread across every single segment of the American population, top to bottom. There is no discrimination whatsoever. We have to decide what we are going to do in order to make sure that we put the proper safeguards in place. Senator Manchin and I, Senators Ayotte, Sanders, Blumenthal, and others have been raising these questions. To the credit of the Senate Judiciary Committee, they are considering legislation to bring to the floor. I thank Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Shaheen, Ayotte, and Senators Grassley and Leahy for their work on that legislation, but that legislation does not conclude anything on this issue that I am talking about right now. This has to be solved by the FDA. That is why this Senator has put a hold on this nomination, saying that they will not get this nomination until they change their policies. We are in the eighth year of this administration, and the policies still remain in place. Abuse deterrent is really a contradiction in terms. If you take these pills--you are a carpenter or an ironworker, and you have a bad back-- you start taking these OxyContin pills right now, and you take them as they are prescribed, and you keep going month after month after month. You are increasing the likelihood on a daily basis that you are going to become addicted to these pills. We have heard these stories over and over again about the pathway in from family members. They come into the office and talk about the pathway in that their child, husband, or son took. It all starts with the same story. They were given the prescribed pills. Right now the industry is saying: Don't worry; there is an abuse deterrent. Tell that to these family members. Tell that to the families who have lost their loved ones. The drugs are not abuse deterrent. It is a contradiction in terms, like jumbo shrimp. There is no such thing. You need to be realistic about what this drug represents once it is consumed over and over again by people in our country who think that because the doctor has given them a bottle of pills, that is going to help them. That is one of the stories we hear over and over again from family members. They say that they question themselves. Could they have done more themselves to help their family member before they became addicted? The common theme from each of them is that you have to assume, when a doctor is giving you a bottle of pills for your family member, that it must be good for them. It must be good for them. It turns out that for 30,000 people in 2014, it wasn't good for them. This number is going to continue to escalate because we haven't put tough enough standards on the books in order to deal with these issues. By refusing to convene expert advisory boards to come in and to create the guidance which is going to be needed in our country going forward, we are going to have a continued flood of opioid deaths that could have been stemmed if we had dealt with this issue in the proper fashion. This is not a hypothetical concern. The policy announced last week by the FDA would not have guaranteed an advisory panel for OxyContin on the market today. The FDA must change its decision not to seek expert advice against the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids. I want to tell a little story. It is a story about one of maybe the five greatest basketball players ever to come out of the State of Massachusetts. His name is Chris Herren. Chris became a Boston Celtic. He was the greatest basketball player in Fall River history, was drafted in the first round by the NBA, and went to the same college I went to--Boston College. In an excerpt of remarks he recently made in DC at the Unite to Face Addiction rally on the National Mall, here is what Chris Herren said: [[Page S936]] I truly believe when it comes to prevention and educating our kids, we need to stop focusing on the worst days and start educating about the first day. At 18 years old, on the campus of Boston College I was introduced to cocaine. I promised myself one time--just one line. That one line took me 14 years to walk away from. Despite myself at 22, my dream came true. I was 33rd pick in the NBA draft, but that same year I was introduced to a little yellow pill--a 40 milligram OxyContin that cost a 20 dollar bill. That 40 milligrams turned into 1600 milligrams a day. And that 20 dollars became a $20,000-a-month Oxy habit. And just 2 years later, that pill turned into a needle and that needle stayed in my arm for the next 8 years. I often say if you can't find it in your heart to have empathy for someone who is battling their illness, then you must know that he or she has a mother, father, son or daughter that is at home with a broken heart that wants them back. Just one pill, lives impacted, some recover and many are lost. Another story--Kaitlyn Oberle from Scituate, MA. Here is what she says: I have survived a fatal opiate overdose, yet I never abused opiates. On November 13, 2015 I spoke to my 27-year-old brother for the last time. Less than 30 minutes after our final conversation, he passed away from an opiate overdose. He was only 16 years old when he first encountered the demon that consumed the better part of his adult life; sadly, that same demon ultimately killed him. Injuries from a dirt bike accident left him with two broken arms, a knee injury, and what felt like an unending supply of prescription opiate painkillers. After his bones mended, he was left with an untreated gaping open wound that would never fully heal itself: an opiate addiction. During my brother's recovery he painted a picture for me of how easy it was for him as a high school teenager and student athlete to call his doctor and request refills for his pain pill prescriptions. When he no longer had injuries to substantiate a prescription, he turned to illegal forms of opiates in both pill and intravenous form. Unfortunately, the damage to his brain had been done. There are many facets to what may cause someone to become addicted to opiates, and there are equally as many angles of attack before there is substantial progress to a viable solution. Mr. Senator, I am writing to you because I am a survivor. I've lived through my worst fear by knowing I can be a voice in helping prevent future deaths caused by opiate addiction. As you convene to debate the fitness of Dr. Robert Califf's nomination for head of the Food and Drug Administration, please ask the Senate to reflect on his time as deputy commissioner. As second in power at the FDA, he has had a chance to do something about these issues. It is time for a change in culture at that agency. A third letter--final letter written by Stephen Jesi, from Malden, MA: I am writing to you as a longtime Maldonian and a father of a 33-year-old daughter Stephenie who passed away on December 13, 2015 of a heroin overdose. Stephenie overdosed on Thursday, two days prior to her death and was released by the hospital at 11:39 p.m. on to the streets. We've experienced this first hand many times. Thank God for Chief Campanello of the Gloucester Police Department who picked up the phone, talked to us, talked to Stephenie, and assisted us in every way he could to get her into treatment. Everybody else just said sorry, there is nothing we can do. I believe that our medical community along with the pharmaceutical industry are grooming and developing drug addicts and putting them right into the hands of the cartels and the drug dealers. Way too many prescriptions are written for more narcotics than are necessary after surgeries with no follow up. Many of those who are predisposed to addiction, either by genetics or co-existing mental health issues, are easy prey for these drugs that begin as legally prescribed. Once they are addicted and can no longer afford the medically prescribed version of the medication they fall into illegal drugs and from there too often the addiction has taken control of their lives. The pharmaceutical industry along with our medical community has to prescribe these highly addictive narcotics much more carefully and offer less addictive medication whenever possible. Most patients take these narcotics for just a couple of days after the surgery but are provided a much longer supply where they can easily fall into the hands of the addict. Our legislators and government officials cannot be tied to the desires of the pharmaceutical lobbyists. This is the cry that is coming out from every community in America. Individuals are saying: How did this happen to my family? How could that accident with the broken leg or the back pain turn into an opioid overdose? How could it have happened? Well, it happened because the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry have not put the protections in place for us to be able to deal with it. Let me give you this number. This is a crazy number. It is a crazy number. Over the last 15, 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of prescription opioid pills that have been allowed to be sold in America. So I am just going to ask people who are listening to this, pick a number. How many 10 milligram prescription opioids were allowed to be made in America last year? Just pick a number. We have 300 million people in America. How many of these pills were allowed or given the permission to be made by pharmaceutical companies? Here is the answer-- 14 billion. May I say that again--14 billion opioid pills for our country. The numbers are out of control. The overprescribing is out of control. We have to find a way to dramatically reduce the amount of drugs that are being sold legally in our country. Before we even reach illegal, you have to start with legal. That is the problem because the Drug Enforcement Administration, the agency responsible for deciding how much each pharmaceutical company can manufacture each year, doesn't even announce how much each company is given permission to manufacture; instead they just announce the gross number of total opioid materials that can be put into pills in our country each year. Does anyone understand this in America, that that is the process? The FDA allows the company to sell it. Then it goes over to the DEA. Then the DEA picks a number of pills that can be sold, and then physicians are allowed to prescribe these pills, but this is the FDA's own number. Listen to this. The FDA asks for voluntary guidelines to be put together for physicians' education so they know what they are doing with these opioids. Pick a number in your brain as to how many physicians have voluntarily accepted medical education on the consequences of prescribing opioids. Pick a number. Here is the correct answer: 10 percent of physicians. That is it. On something that is so catastrophic, something that is creating an epidemic in our country, you would think this would be mandatory; that the medical associations at the State level, the national level had created some kind of mandatory education. It hasn't happened. Is it mandatory in medical schools across America that they receive education as to what the consequences are of prescribing opioids? Not at all. So who would think a physician would have to be trained in how to handle pain? I mean, a physician is only dealing with the issue all day long, every single day. You would think there would be some understanding then of what the consequences were of the medicines they were prescribing. No courses in medical school are mandated. No courses are mandated after you have graduated, you are practicing medicine, and now you are licensed by the DEA to prescribe opiates--no courses. So as we move forward on the legislation that is going to be coming out on the floor of the Senate, I intend to make an amendment--Senator Blumenthal and I tried to make it in the Judiciary Committee, and we are going to be making it on the Senate floor--requiring the Drug Enforcement Administration to require mandatory education for any physician who wants to prescribe these drugs. That is the minimum, the minimum that the medical profession should have to accept as a responsibility before they are allowed to prescribe these drugs. There is another amendment which I am working on with Senator Paul of Kentucky, and that is an amendment that is going to increase access to medication that can help people deal with their addictions. Again, that is a classic example of a Democrat and Republican working together on these issues. Senator Ayotte and I have an amendment that would create a Good Samaritan protection for any American, any family member who wants to apply Narcan to a family member or someone who has overdosed and would die in the absence of Narcan, the antidote, being applied to them. Senator Ayotte and I are working on that amendment. We are trying hard to find ways where, unfortunately, legislatively we can act. This should have happened at the agencies. This should have happened in the medical profession. We shouldn't be forced to debate this on the Senate floor, but it is absolutely, [[Page S937]] indispensably necessary for us to take this action. This is the epidemic of our time. The death rates now in the age group that is affected by this epidemic are now declining at the same rates as they did during the war in Vietnam. We haven't seen anything like this since the war in Vietnam in the death rates--30,000 people-- quadrupling in 14 years, escalating on a daily basis. It is time for the Senate to take real action on this issue so we can deal with it. In Boston, MA, we had a police chief who saw that something had gone wrong, Chief Campanello. He said that incarceration doesn't work and instead treatment should be substituted. So beginning last June, what Chief Campanello said in Gloucester, MA, was that if you come in and you are an addict, you have a problem, you come into the police station, bring your drugs with you, we are not going to arrest you, we are going to put you into treatment immediately--no arrests. Four hundred people have walked into that police station in Gloucester, MA, in just 8 months--400 people. By shifting the paradigm from arrests to treatment, 800 more people--800 total across the country--as city after city, town after town adopts this model, have now accepted that as a better route for them in their lives, to just turn themselves in at the local police stations. He has partnered with a man named John Rosenthal. John Rosenthal is an activist in our State, and he helps to fund this program. Last Wednesday night, tragically, John Rosenthal's own nephew, Nathan Huggins-Rosenthal, age 34, died of an overdose in Calgary, Canada. My heart goes out to the Rosenthal family because obviously they were committed to dealing with this issue, pioneering ways to have addicts be able to have a place they can go. Yet in John Rosenthal's own family, his nephew overdosed just last Wednesday night. As Senator Ayotte was saying, there is no neighborhood immunity. There is no family who is completely protected. This epidemic has been created by pharmaceutical companies, by physicians, by the agencies responsible to deal with it, and it is now time for us to put in place the protections which are needed to deal with it. Let me give you opioids 101 so you can understand how we get to this--what are opioids, how do they work, and why do they lead to heroin abuse. Here is how it works. It starts with a seed pod of the opium poppy. We get the morphine, a naturally occurring opiate pain reliever from that pod seed. The morphine interacts with so-called opioid receptors that are found in high concentrations in areas of the brain that control pain and emotions. Taking opiates can increase the levels of dopamine in the brain's reward areas and produce euphoria or a rush of pain relief and relaxation. In fact, morphine, which was first identified in the early 1800s is named after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. In 1895, the Bayer Corporation, Bayer Aspirin--the Bayer Corporation in Germany introduced a new cough suppressant marketed as a safer alternative to morphine. This new wonder drug was called heroin. In the 1920s, drug manufacturers began making fully synthetic analogs to morphine. They were called opioids. These drugs contain the same basic chemical framework as morphine, and they have exactly the same mechanism of action in the brain. They share common chemical features that allow them to buy into the brain's opioid receptors, and they all are considered highly addictive. These drugs vary widely in potency. That is the amount of the drug required to reach the same level of pain relief and sedation as morphine. OxyContin, for example, is 150 percent as strong as morphine. Heroin is also an opioid. They share the same fundamental chemical structure. Heroin binds to the very same receptors in the brain and produces the same euphoria and sedation, and heroin is plagued by the same addiction potential. Heroin is classified as a schedule I drug, the most dangerous class, because it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse and addiction. So this is the pathway between opioids and heroin and why that pathway is very short. It is all about the chemistry because OxyContin has the nearly identical molecular constitution as heroin. Over time, the brain, the receptors are saying: I need to have to continue to have that hit. Thus, we have this epidemic where 80 percent of all people in the United States who are dying from heroin overdoses started on prescription opioid drugs that had been prescribed by their physicians. Physicians should have to be educated. The FDA should have expert advisory panels that give the strongest possible guidance to the pharmaceutical companies. That is what is missing in this equation. It starts there. We need a debate on $1.1 billion for more treatment and more education, and we are going to have that debate on the Senate floor. These local families, these local groups, they are heroes, but heroes need help, and it is time for us to fund those programs in the same way we funded the Ebola crisis and the same way we are being asked to help to fund the Zika crisis. We have a crisis in America ourselves, but if we don't deal with the issue right from the beginning at the FDA, at the DEA, and at the AMA, we are not going to solve this problem. We are just putting medical facilities in place to deal with the consequences of having no policy. This is our great opportunity to have a debate in our country. I can't thank the Members enough for beginning to deal with this issue on a serious basis, but we can't be afraid of the pharmaceutical industry. We can't be afraid of the American Medical Association. We can't be afraid of the bureaucrats in these agencies who say: Oh, Mr. or Ms. Senator, we are the experts. You don't know what you are talking about. Well, just let me tell you this. The people of the United States don't trust the experts anymore in these agencies. They want more accountability. They want other experts to come in to check those experts, to ask the tough questions on behalf of the American people. That is why I have a hold on Dr. Robert Califf's nomination for the FDA, because right now the FDA is saying it is going to continue business as usual and that is just wrong. That is just plain wrong. It has to stop there. The signal must come from this administration. I thank all the Members for this discussion, for where we are today and where we are going to have to go in the months ahead, but I don't think we should end this year without a fundamental change that has taken place in our society in this relationship. I will just add one final issue, and that is the issue of how many pills, how many pills a doctor can prescribe initially to a patient. We are now debating that issue in the State of Massachusetts. Governor Baker has been saying it should only be 3 days' worth of pills. One of the counterproposals is 7 days of pills that can be used by the patient. I do know this. We have to start here because right now doctors are handing out bottles of 60 to patients who only need a week's worth or 3 days' worth. When you leave a dentist's office, you don't need 60 days' worth of pills for your wisdom teeth that have been removed. When you have some pain that you just got from playing a softball game and you have twisted your back, you don't need a bottle of 60 or 30. You might need a few pills for 3 days or 7 days, but you don't need the 60. Having that 60 in that medicine cabinet is the beginning of the problem. I thank Governor Baker for what he is doing on this issue. They haven't resolved it in Massachusetts. I think we have to debate that in the Halls of Congress as well. They are all related, how these pills get into the blood system of our country. Again, I thank all of the Members for their consideration of this issue. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,77303,77303,77374,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [senate] [pages s929-s937] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] filling the supreme court vacancy mr. leahy. mr. president, this past weekend the nation honored justice antonin scalia, who was laid to rest after serving on the supreme court for nearly three decades. marcelle and i were home in vermont when we learned that justice scalia had passed. frankly, we were stunned by the news. i did not often agree with justice scalia, but he was a brilliant jurist with a deep commitment to our country and to the constitution, and we enjoyed his friendship for decades. he will be remembered as one of the most influential justices in modern history. while his family and all should have had a chance to mourn his passing, i was shocked when, in the immediate wake of his death, senate republicans moved quickly to shut down the constitutionally mandated process to fill the vacancy left on the supreme court. within hours of his death being announced, they declared they would oppose any effort to confirm the next supreme court justice this year. i have served in this body longer than any member here and i have heard some shocking things during that time, but i am surprised by the political crassness of these statements. before a nominee had even been named, some republicans reflexively decided to prematurely reject anyone--anyone--nominated by the president. this impulsive rush to judgment runs completely contrary to how this body has always treated nominees--always treated nominees--to the highest court in the land. republicans should not allow the hyper- partisan rhetoric of the campaign trail to trump one of the senate's most important constitutional duties. i have talked to the president, and i know he will fulfill his constitutional duty. he will nominate an individual to bring the supreme court back to full strength, and of course he should. the president has already begun consulting with members of both parties in senate, but after a nomination has been made, we in the senate should get to work and do our jobs--the jobs we were elected to do. i was all over my state of vermont last week. the vermonters i spoke with last week reflect americans across the country who are tired of partisan political games that are chipping away at the foundation of our constitutional democracy. i heard this from both republicans and democrats in vermont. as oliver goodenough, a law professor at vermont law school, wrote this weekend in the rutland herald, an extended supreme court vacancy caused by senate inaction ``would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment.'' mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from the rutland herald, feb. 21, 2016] court battle--another shutdown? (by oliver r. goodenough) within hours of the announcement of anton scalia's death, one of our political parties was already trying to make points with the electorate about the process of picking his successor. at that evening's debate, the gop presidential candidates advocated that the constitutional process should be suspended, either voluntarily by president barack obama or by purposeful inaction by the senate. mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader, was just as speedy, trying to warn obama off from acting on the mandate of article ii, section 2, which charges the president with nominating a replacement for justice scalia and the senate with providing its advice and consent on the president's choice. one can understand mcconnell's disappointment. appointments to the supreme court are for life, which means only resignation, impeachment or death will create a vacancy. in the somewhat ghoulish game of waiting for a slot on the closely divided supreme court to open up, the short-term expectations of mortality had been focused elsewhere--justice ruth bader ginsberg, in particular, has been a survivor of long-odds pancreatic cancer. so republicans were brought up short by the death of a conservative hero, whose replacement could shift the balance of the court. the accidents of history will do that sometimes. the constitution makes provision for what happens in such a case--in the kind of clear, unequivocal language that is the best target for justice scalia's vaunted originalism. the president nominates. the senate, for its part, gives the qualifications of any nominee a serious vetting; it is not entitled to just ignore the nomination. some reports have argued that such a course of process sabotage would create a ``constitutional crisis.'' this is probably an overstatement; it would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment. with nearly a year left in obama's term, waiting for his successor to name the new justice in 2017 would remove the ninth voice from the court not just for the current yearly term but also for most of the following term as well, since the replacement would arrive in the spring and miss months of argument and deliberation. for the better part of a year, the vacancy would sit like a broken tooth in the operations of the court. close cases would often end up tied, with the result that the lower court finding would remain the binding result. not itself a disaster, but a result that the constitutional provisions for naming a successor are designed to avoid. the embarrassment of sabotage on judicial appointments actually already exists: republicans in the senate have effectively shut down the process of nominating new judges for the federal courts of appeal. the blockage isn't over qualifications--such considerations would be a proper exercise of the senate's confirmation role, raised in committee and on the senate floor rather, the nominations are sitting in a limbo of inaction: it is simply a matter of not doing the job at all. this is the real crisis, a state of politics where republicans in the house and senate are willing to derail the processes of government to thwart the actions of president obama, good, bad or indifferent. the most obvious example was the full shutdown of government. limited shutdowns on matters like judicial appointments are parts of the same pattern. of course, obstructionism is not just a republican failing, and it can be present in both parties to some degree in the spicy stew of politics in our robust democracy. but the bottom-line commitment of all parties should be to maintaining a functioning government, structured and administered in accordance with the framework set out in our constitution, even when it is not working to their advantage. why is this so hard for at least some republicans to buy into? why the willingness, indeed eagerness, to bring down the house we all live in? the key is a widespread denial among republicans of the legitimacy of the obama presidency. this is partly related to the man himself--all the blather about his birth, his religion, etc. while many americans find it a vindication that we can elect an african-american to our highest office, for some it is an impossibility which in turn justifies the most extreme forms of resistance. race is our original sin as a country, and its legacy haunts us still. republicans are also in denial over changes in the social and economic fabric of america. we are, as always, in the process of moving from what america has been to what it will be. conservatives have a role to play, reminding us of the valuable parts of where we came from. progressives have a role, recognizing the imperatives of the future and charting the paths of change toward positive outcomes. politics is the sometimes rough and tumble playing field where the dialog on this goes forward. the intransigence of shutdowns, however, whether of the full government or a critical aspect like the nomination process, exceeds the boundaries of acceptable play and hurts us all. obama needs to make a good faith nomination to fill the vacancy on the supreme court. mcconnell and his colleagues in the senate majority need to review it in good faith. that is what the constitution provides; that is what the country needs. get on with it. mr. leahy. we must not let that dysfunction infect the supreme court, an independent, coequal branch of government that was designed to be above politics. the next nominee to the supreme court deserves full and fair consideration by the senate. this includes a timely hearing and then having an up-or-down vote. i am worried that even before president obama took office, and ever since then--even after he was reelected by a 5 million-vote plurality-- there has been an unrelenting and cynical campaign by some hyper- partisans to delegitimize the president's authority. there were the birthers, and there have been and still are spurious slurs of all kinds. outside of this body, the efforts to undermine president obama's constitutional authority to fill this supreme court vacancy draws some of their vehemence and venom from these dark corners. but every one of us took an oath of office--every one of us--and we [[page s930]] are sworn to uphold our constitutional duties. let us not be intimidated and pressured to avoid our sworn duty. let us act for the good of the american people and for the good of this great nation. some have justified their call for unprecedented obstruction by claiming it is because the american people need a voice. give me a break. the american people have spoken--millions of americans--and an overwhelming majority of vermonters voted in record numbers in 2008 and again in 2012 to elect president obama. in doing so, they granted him constitutional authorities for all 8 years of those two terms. a president isn't elected for 1 year or 2 years or 3 years. a president is elected for 4 years at a time. just saying that president obama is a ``lame duck'' president does not make it true. in fact, the next election is not until november. the american people expect those they elected to do their jobs for their entire term. that means both in the senate and in the white house. they don't expect senators to say: well, we can't vote on anything this year because it is an election year. we will collect our full salary, but we are not going to vote on anything. the american people don't like that. it is rare that a vacancy in the supreme court arises during an election year, but it is just false to say justices do not get confirmed in presidential election years. more than a dozen supreme court justices have been confirmed in a presidential election year. the democrats led the senate during president reagan's final year in office, and we voted. president reagan's nominee was confirmed by a democratic-led senate during the president's final year in office. he received a hearing and a confirmation vote. it would be the height of hypocrisy to say we shouldn't apply the same process with a democrat in the white house and republicans in control of the senate. we can't say that we will follow our constitutional duties and do our work if we have a democratic-controlled senate and a republican president but we can't do it if it is the other way around. some republican senators have acknowledged that the next supreme court nominee should receive a fair hearing. but the process can't end there. i have served on the judiciary committee for 36 years. during my time on the committee, we have never refused to send a supreme court nominee to the full senate for a confirmation vote. even in those cases where a majority of the committee had opposed the nomination, we still reported the nominee to the full senate. once reported to the full senate, every supreme court nominee has received an up-or-down confirmation vote during my 40 years in the senate. we have to uphold this bipartisan tradition for the next supreme court nominee because so much is at stake. merely holding a hearing without full committee process and a confirmation vote is insufficient for a supreme court nominee. it would be a charade, and it would be an avoidance of our constitutional duties. if republicans refuse to uphold their constitutional responsibility to consider the next supreme court nominee, i believe it will harm our constitutional system of government. if they succeed in deliberately holding open a seat on the supreme court for more than a year, they will be intentionally disabling the court's ability to fulfill its constitutional role, and republicans will be harming the supreme court for more than a year. justice scalia once wrote that a supreme court of just eight justices risked the possibility the court ``will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.'' the legal issues before the supreme court are significant, and the importance of a single vote on the court cannot be overstated. one vote on the supreme court decided landmark cases concerning our campaign finance laws, clean water and air policies, marriage equality, and voting rights. americans deserve a fully functioning supreme court. i have traveled all over my state. i have traveled all over this country. i have talked to republicans and democrats alike. what i know about my fellow americans that makes me so proud is that they show up for work and they do their jobs. americans don't have the luxury of telling their bosses that instead of doing their job, they would rather delay, delay, delay. if they did, they would probably be fired. the u.s. senate shouldn't tell the american people that we are not going to do our jobs; that we will delay, delay, delay. the stakes are too high. the american people actually expect us to show up for work and do our job. let's get to work, do the job the american people sent us here to do. and we may want to reread our oath to uphold the constitution. it requires no less. mr. president, i don't see others on the floor about to speak. i will yield the floor when i do. we have allowed this whole process to become far too partisan. i am a lawyer, a former prosecutor. i have argued cases in the state court, federal courts, federal trial courts, and federal appellate courts. when i have gone to the federal courts, i have always thought that the beauty of this--whether republican or democratic nominees--is that i could get a fair hearing. i thought it was a great honor to go there. people come from other parts of the world, and they talk about our federal judiciary as an example for them. i recall that when a country that had been under dictatorship changed to a more democratic form of government, some of their people came to my office and asked about our judicial system. they said: is it true that in the united states of america, people can actually sue their government? i said: that is true. it happens all the time. they said: well, is it true that sometimes the government loses? i said: it happens all the time. they said: well, do you replace the judge when that happens? i said: no. they are independent. it was like a lightbulb went on. they realized how different we are. think of the image we send to the rest of the world--as well as 300 million americans--if we say: no, we are going to politicize the supreme court, the court that is supposed to be the final arbiter on constitutional questions. look at what it says to them if we say: yes, we have time to take more recesses this year than i think the senate ever has, that i can ever remember, but we don't have time to do the job we were elected to do, the job we are paid to do--have a hearing on and vote on a supreme court nominee. the american people have jobs. they can't pick and choose when they will bother to show up. they can't say ``i know this is what i am supposed to do in this job, but i don't feel like it'' or ``i have a partisan reason not to do it. i am going to sit this out. see me next year, and i may do my job.'' nobody would accept that. but that is really what is happening. the republican leadership is saying ``no, we want to sit this out. we don't want to do our work. we don't want to do our job. see us next year, and maybe we will then.'' that has never happened. it never happened during an election year. there have been at least a dozen supreme court vacancies during an election year, and a dozen times the senate, no matter who was president, came together and handled the nominee and got them confirmed. why did senators do that in the past? probably because they figured they had been elected, they were being paid by the american people, it was part of their job, and so they showed up and did their job. are we now going to change what has been the precedent ever since the beginning of this country and say ``oh, we are better than that. we don't have to do our job. keep paying us, but we don't have to do our job even though we have taken an oath to uphold the constitution and do our job''? even justice scalia said that would be wrong, that you shouldn't have an eight-member supreme court. and we don't. let's actually show up and do the job we were elected to do, do the job we are paid to do. let's do what every other american has to do. they have to show up for work. they have to do their jobs. they can't say ``i don't feel like it this year. i will see you next year. oh, by the way, send me my paycheck.'' that is not the american way; it should not be the senate way. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[page s931]] mr. schumer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. schumer. mr. president, i rise today first to praise and echo the words of the senior senator from vermont, our ranking member on judiciary, in urging our republican colleagues to give a fair and full consideration of a supreme court nominee. i particularly wish to praise my friend, the ranking member, for his eloquent remarks and for his leadership of the committee when he was chair and as ranking member. my friend from vermont is absolutely right. just as the president has a constitutional responsibility to name a nominee to the court, the senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on that nominee. frankly, it is the senate's job to consider supreme court nominees, and the american people expect the senate to do its job. we are telling senate republicans, america is telling senate republicans: do your job. plain and simple. my friend, the chairman of the judiciary committee, should commit to holding hearings. the distinguished majority leader should commit to holding a vote. it has been a longstanding precedent of the senate to consider supreme court nominees in a timely manner, even in election years: justice pitney in 1912; brandeis and clarke in 1916; cardozo at a time when america was even more divided than now, 1932. in the middle of the depression, the great election between roosevelt and hoover, they put in cardozo in that last year. murphy in 1940 and kennedy in 1988 were confirmed. justice kennedy was confirmed in the last year of a presidency with a republican in the white house and democrats in control of the senate. that is the mirror image and the most recent chance we have to compare how democrats were acting, how republicans were acting. all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who were here voted that way. i know today our republican colleagues point to what senator biden said. they have pointed to what chairman leahy said. they have pointed to what i and other democrats have said. there are equal quotations that senator mcconnell, senator grassley, and others have said, each voicing a different view than maybe is being voiced today. but none of those were held up. you can have all the competing quotes you want; they amount to nothing. the american people are strong--democrats and republicans--in telling senate republicans: do your job. the bottom line is very simple. to say that there will be no hearing, no vote, no consideration whatsoever even before a nominee is named to a vacancy, that is not doing your job; that is quitting before you start. senator leahy said it well. imagine someone showing up at work. imagine if an average american showed up at work and said: i am going to take a year off, but you still have to pay me. your boss wouldn't stand for it. well, our boss, the american people, will not stand for this because it will take over 300 days before a supreme court nominee is filled, at best. the kind of knee-jerk political obstruction the american people have grown so frustrated with in the congress is what our republican colleagues are saying. if republicans truly respect the constitution, they should follow it and consider a nomination from the sitting president rather than playing political games. instead, they are once again threatening to bow to the most extreme rightwing voices and engage in the kind of political obstruction that brought us a 3-week government shutdown that cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and took $15 to $20 billion out of the economy. in 2013, after the hard right didn't get its way in its fight to undo the affordable care act, they waged a war to shut down the government. republican leaders listened. they probably knew it was wrong in their heads, but they listened. what happened? after 3 weeks with their tails between their legs, the leadership had to say we have to open up the government even though we haven't repealed the affordable care act. the now-junior senator from texas had urged that course, and they were foolhardy to follow. the junior senator from texas is now urging the course of having no hearings and no votes. i tell my republican colleagues--and to his credit, senator mcconnell said we have to get the senate working again--that this is a foolhardy course, and it will not stand. it will not last because the american people are telling senate republicans: do your job. republicans say the american people should have a voice in choosing a supreme court justice. well, guess what. president obama won reelection by a large margin in 2012. many of the issues they bring up now were there then, such as security and the affordable care act. there was a referendum on all these kinds of things. the people spoke loudly and clearly on november 6, 2012, when they elected the president to another 4-year term. that is 4 years, as called for in the constitution, not 3 years, as some of my republican friends like to say now. if republicans get their way, we would have a 4-to-4 gridlocked supreme court for a year that would tie the court and large parts of the country in knots. let me say, if we have a tie in the supreme court decision, the decision has no presidential value. you get gridlock and confusion. america doesn't want gridlock. they don't want gridlock on the floor of the senate, they don't want gridlock on the floor of the house, and they don't want gridlock in the supreme court. the american people expect the senate to do its job. they are tired of obstruction and ``my way or the highway'' politics. again i say that our friend, the junior senator from texas, likes to quote the constitution. he likes to walk around carrying the constitution. that is great. i am all for that. i would like him to show me the lines in the constitution that say in the last year of the president's term, he doesn't have the power or the right to nominate a supreme court justice. of course he does. yet the republican majority-- at least by its stance now--is taking away that right because they will not even have a hearing. some people say: well, they will just vote no after the hearing. maybe yes, maybe no. i believe every member has the right to vote no if they think the nominee is out of the mainstream, and i will be the first to admit mainstream is defined differently by different people. but hearings are amazing things. if the candidate is being open and honest, hearings help us to get to know the candidate better. whatever one thinks of hearings, the last four nominees of the supreme court-- two under president bush, two under president obama--got bipartisan votes and passed. this idea of not having a vote is wrong. for the sake of our constitution and for the sake of getting our country moving again, i urge and plead with my colleagues on the other side to do their job. that is what the american people want, plain and simple. it is time for the senate to do its job. once the president nominates someone, we need to have hearings with our republican colleagues in a careful and thoughtful way. they don't have to rush a nominee through-- no dilatory tactics--and then there should be a vote. i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. durbin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. remembering justice antonin scalia and filling the supreme court vacancy mr. durbin. mr. president, on february 13 the nation was shaken by the news that supreme court justice antonin scalia had passed away. justice scalia served on the nation's highest court for 29 years, and he was a major figure on the american legal landscape. justice scalia was described by judge richard posner of the seventh circuit as ``the most influential justice of the last quarter century.'' over the years i came to know justice scalia. he was a man of great intellect, good humor, and he was a very social person. we certainly disagreed on many fundamental issues, but even those who disagreed with justice scalia on legal matters still admired him as a person. justice ruth bader ginsburg--no ideological ally of justice scalia-- wrote [[page s932]] after his death, ``we were best buddies.'' she described him as ``a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit, with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh.'' justice ginsberg said she and justice scalia were ``different in our interpretation of written texts,'' but they were ``one in our reverence for the constitution and the institution we serve.'' i have great respect for the decades justice scalia spent in public service. my thoughts and prayers clearly go with his family. as surprised as i was by the news of justice scalia's passing, i was amazed at how quickly the senate majority leader, senator mcconnell of kentucky, issued a press release saying, ``this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.'' his statement came out within 90 minutes of the press report of the justice passing. this statement clearly came at a time when most people reflected on the loss of the supreme court justice, and just like that, the conversation shifted from the passing of an american legal giant to an attack on president obama's authority to fill his vacancy on the supreme court. what does the constitution tell us about filling a vacancy on the supreme court? there are very few oaths a person takes in their life. as members of the senate, we swear each time we are reelected to a new term to uphold and defend that constitution. what does the constitution say about a vacancy on the supreme court? if you go to article ii, section 2, it is explicit and very simple. the president ``shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint . . . judges of the supreme court.'' the president, under the constitution, has an express responsibility to submit to the senate the nomination of a person who is qualified to serve on our nation's highest court. then, of course, the senate has a job to do: give that nominee a fair hearing and a timely vote. this is our constitutional responsibility as u.s. senators. this is what we have been elected to do. aside from voting on a declaration of war, i believe there is no greater responsibility than voting on the confirmation of a supreme court nominee. i serve on the judiciary committee, and it has been my privilege and honor to consider the nominations of four of the current supreme court justices. there is no question that we have the time remaining to meet our constitutional responsibility in a thoughtful and careful way. it is now february of 2016. we are almost a year away from january of 2017 when president obama will officially leave office. the republican leader would have us leave a seat on the nation's highest court vacant for at least 1 year. not since the civil war has the senate taken longer than a year to fill a supreme court vacancy, and it certainly shouldn't happen now. usually it takes the senate about 2 months to consider a supreme court nominee. senator leahy, the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee said that on average it takes about 67 days. so we have more than enough time to do this in a thoughtful and responsible way. even during presidential election years, the senate has routinely confirmed supreme court justices. it has happened over a dozen times, most recently in 1988, when justice anthony kennedy was confirmed by a 97-to-0 vote during president reagan's final year in office. president reagan--a republican president about to leave office--submitted a name, justice kennedy, to the supreme court, and a democratic-controlled senate approved it with a vote of 97 to nothing. so to argue that this has never happened before is to ignore history, and even recent history. in the past, senate republican leaders have said that the confirmation process should move forward with as little time as a month before an election. consider the presidential election of 1968. on june 13 of that year, chief justice earl warren informed the president he wanted to step down. on june 26 of the election year, johnson nominated associate justice abe fortas to become chief justice and nominated george homer thornberry to fill his seat. president johnson had already announced he would not run again, but senate republican leaders did not call president johnson a lame duck and question his right to put forward nominees. in fact, senate republican leader everett dirksen of my state of illinois said on july 13 of that year, ``i find that term `lame duck' as applied to the president of the united states as an entirely improper and offensive term.'' republican senator dirksen was referring to the lame duck status of president lyndon johnson, a democrat. the senate gave the president's nominee a prompt hearing in the judiciary committee. as it turned out, the hearing uncovered a range of ethics concerns about justice fortas, and in late september and early october, senate republicans filibustered his nomination. fortas subsequently withdrew. but on october 3--same election year, just a month before the election--the new york times reported that ``senator dirksen said there was still time for the president to submit a new name and rush it through the senate before the congress adjourned.'' the republican leader said that even with a month left, we should try to fill the vacant seat. this was a month before the presidential election. where are the leaders like everett dirksen in today's republican party, senators who are willing to roll up their sleeves and get down to the work of considering the nominees on their merits so the supreme court can do its work? we have a constitutional responsibility, as does the president. make no mistake--the supreme court needs a full complement of justices on the bench. when the court has an even number, as it does today, four to four, important cases are increasingly likely to end up in a tie vote. when that happens in a case, the ruling of the lower court stands and it is as if the supreme court never heard the case at all. major legal and constitutional questions are constantly brought before the court. when the court is frozen at an even number of justices, many of those questions go unresolved and millions of americans who are impacted by these questions have to wait. that is not fair to the american people. that is why historically the senate moved to fill vacancies of the court. that is why so many americans are troubled by senate republicans' call for a 1-year hiatus in filling the supreme court vacancy. former justice sandra day o'connor said in an interview last week that she disagreed with the idea of waiting for the next president to appoint a new justice. justice o'connor said, ``we need somebody there now to do the job. let's get on with it.'' i agree with justice o'connor. when president obama submits a nominee, which he will do in coming days, the senate needs to do its job, its constitutional responsibility, and give that nominee a fair hearing and timely vote. my republican colleagues can choose to vote for or against the nominee. that is their prerogative. they should not simply duck the vote. we were not elected to this job to ignore important issues; we were elected to cast votes on important issues. this is too important an issue to simply ignore. when it comes to giving the president's nominee a fair hearing, i certainly hope senate republicans don't adopt the donald trump position. when asked about the president's nomination, mr. trump, as he is wont to do, gave us a juicy quote. here is what he said: ``i think it's up to mitch mcconnell and everybody else to stop it--it's called delay, delay, delay.'' i am sure the senate republicans were not happy with that statement by trump, but he did speak for a number of people who believe that is the right strategy: stop the president from using his constitutional authority; stop the senate from accepting its constitutional responsibility. i hope my republican colleagues don't follow mr. trump's lead and try to stop president obama's nominee through endless delays. no one is going to be fooled if senate republicans spend weeks haggling over unreasonable document requests or swamping the nominee with endless written questions. mr. trump has already made it clear that ``delay, delay, delay'' is simply a strategy to stop the seat from being filled. if republicans delay in an effort to run out the clock, we will know it, and the american people will know it. the american people want us to act. they want us to accept our constitutional [[page s933]] responsibility. it is time for us to get down to work and do our job. the senate can't afford to sit on its hands for 1 year and leave the supreme court hanging in the balance. when president obama names a nominee, i urge my republican colleagues to give that person a fair hearing and timely vote. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding chair. the senator from new hampshire. ms. ayotte. mr. president, i come to the floor today to express my serious concerns with the fda's actions on opioid pain relievers and my concern that they have not sufficiently addressed what we are seeing as an epidemic in my home state of new hampshire. the implications of prescribing opioids and ensuring that we take a very strong public health approach toward these pain relievers is important. i know my that my colleagues--senators markey, manchin, and blumenthal--have been on the floor previously to discuss the concerns they share about the fda as well. i thank them for their leadership on this important issue. i think what is important to understand here is what we are facing when it comes to heroin, the drug deaths that are occurring in my home state of new hampshire, the connection between people who are misusing prescription opioids and then becoming addicted to heroin, and the deadly use of a drug called fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. when we bring this all together, we have a situation with opioid abuse which includes painkiller abuse, heroin use, fentanyl abuse, and it is killing people in new hampshire and across this country. across this country, approximately 30,000 people died of heroin or prescription opioid overdoses in 2014. as we come to receive the 2015 numbers, unfortunately, if the experience is anything like my home state of new hampshire, the numbers are going to be much larger than 30,000 because in new hampshire, every corner of my state has been impacted by this. i had the privilege of serving as attorney general before i came to the senate, and i dealt with many drug issues as attorney general. in fact, i had a drug task force that reported to me. we dealt with the surge of methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illegal drugs that certainly have caused addiction and people to struggle with addiction. obviously, alcohol is also something people struggle with when it is misused, but i have never seen anything like this. i talk to my law enforcement officers and i talk to my first responders about what they are dealing with. in 2015, in new hampshire, we had over 400 overdose deaths, and those 400 deaths were situations where there was a combination--many of them, hundreds of them--of heroin and/or fentanyl. and that was a dramatic increase over 2014. in 2014, we had 320 deaths. and by the way, that is a 60-percent increase from the year before. unfortunately, this is not stopping. it is the single most important public health and safety issue facing the state of new hampshire right now, but i know new hampshire is not alone. certainly working with my colleague rob portman from ohio, i know this is hitting ohio. working with sheldon whitehouse from rhode island, i know this is hitting rhode island. amy klobuchar from minnesota--this is hitting so many different places in our country. that is why i know senator markey from massachusetts is concerned about this and senator manchin from west virginia, who was on the floor earlier. this is about our quality of life in this country and the ability for people to live full lives and about our public safety and about our children most of all. the headline from the union leader over this weekend: ``fentanyl, other drugs suspected in three manchester deaths.'' so we had three deaths in new hampshire, in our largest city, within 24 hours, and those three deaths were from a combination of heroin and fentanyl. according to assistant fire chief daniel goonan, in just 24 hours in manchester, these overdoses claimed the lives of a 23-year-old man, a 29-year-old woman, and a 34-year-old man. that was in just a 24-hour period. in fact, what our first responders are seeing--i did a ride-along with the manchester fire department. i was there less than an hour. we went to an overdose, and i saw the firefighters and their emergency personnel bring someone back to life using cpr and narcan. if we did not have that drug, the over 400 we had in new hampshire--i can't even tell you what the numbers would be, because not only did i do a ride- along with the manchester fire department, i did one with the police, too, and we went to two overdoses in an hour and a half, and i saw them bring those individuals back to life. but lest we think this is something that happens on some other street or in some other neighborhood, i can assure you that this can happen to any family, and that is something we need to understand. that was really brought home for me from a wonderful family i met, doug and pam griffin, who lost their beautiful daughter courtney. they are wonderful people. i think about what our first responders are facing. this same article i just talked about, over the weekend--unbelievable. twice the fire department in manchester revived a woman who was 4 months pregnant, working on her in front of her young children. i will never forget the overdose i went to. the firefighters came into the room, and there was a young man on the ground. they administered the narcan and brought him back. but do you know what was in the corner? a crib with a baby in it. the firefighter grabbed the baby and was bringing the baby over. the father was lying on the ground. so this is having a tremendous impact on not only those who are struggling with addiction but also their families and the children around them and the future generations. in this article, the assistant fire chief from manchester basically said: it is more deadly than we have ever seen. so that is why i have been proud to work with my colleagues, proud to work with senators whitehouse, portman, klobuchar, and so many others on the comprehensive addiction recovery act. i thank the members of the judiciary committee for voting that important piece of legislation out of the committee, and i look forward to us taking that up on the floor. right now pending on the floor, we have an important nomination for the fda. that is why i come to the floor today, because if you look at what we are addressing here, we are concerned about heroin and fentanyl, but there is a very important connection for us to understand, unfortunately, and it is also why i have been such a strong supporter of prescription-monitoring programs. the opiates that are prescribed--samhsa has found that four out of five individuals who turned to heroin actually started with prescription opiates and misusing prescription opiates or overusing those and then transitioning to heroin because heroin is cheaper, unfortunately, on our streets. so it is very important that we have the fda engaging on this issue very aggressively with our medical community, that the fda take a prominent role in ensuring that what they are saying is, this is the appropriate use of prescription opiates. in my humble opinion, the fda needs to take a much more aggressive role than it has in recommending the appropriate uses and engaging the medical community and the pharmaceutical community, very importantly, on this discussion, this public health crisis we are facing. we have come together as a body on this issue, and i think it is important that we have been working on this in a very bipartisan basis. but just to talk about the importance of the fda and the leadership we need there, in 2013 we saw the fda approve zohydro--a powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation, and an abuse- deterrent formulation is important so that it will be used for its intended purpose and not chopped up or otherwise abused. yet the fda approves zohydro--this powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation despite the fact that its own advisory committee voted against approving the drug by a vote of 11 to 2. i see senator markey coming to the floor, and i appreciate his leadership on this. one of the things that i know have troubled senator markey, senator manchin, and me as well is that last year the fda approved oxycontin [[page s934]] for use by children as young as 11, and when they did that, they did not have an advisory committee or use an advisory committee before taking that step. so i would say that i certainly appreciate that i had the opportunity to sit down with secretary burwell on this issue and learn more about the fda's action plan that it issued, but unfortunately i believe the agency has to go further than it is going. the example i would use is the issuance of the recommendations for the children as young as 11 with oxycontin, without an advisory committee on something so important, seems--to me, it just doesn't pass the commonsense test. so i would recommend to the fda, let's make sure we have an advisory committee look at this issue carefully and then reissue a recommendation, because to me it seems important that we have that guidance and the careful, thoughtful approach of the advisory committee. of course, what troubles me is we hope they would take the advisory committee's recommendations, unlike what happened with zohydro, unfortunately. so we need leadership right now in the fda. i have concerns that we are not going to be in a position where we get the strongest leadership we can have. we have a nominee pending on the floor. these concerns are very important. i hope, if he is confirmed, he will be aggressive on this issue and that the fda will take a stronger leadership role on opiates, understanding that they have a very important role when it comes to this public health concern. right now i am not satisfied with where we are. i believe there is so much more we need to do. that is actually why yesterday i voted to not go forward with this nomination, because i haven't heard this clear statement, i haven't heard what the leadership plans are on this issue. while i appreciate some of the steps the department of health and human services has taken, those steps to me need to be very much strengthened. as i look at the fda's action plan, it pledges to make the use of advisory committees more frequent, but it should require the use of advisory committees for all opioid pain relievers, not just when we decide we want to use it. this should be consistent, given that we unfortunately know that the data is there on the connection between misuse of opioid pain relievers and the connection to those who unfortunately then turn to heroin, with the deadly combination of fentanyl, which is killing people in this country. again, i wish to thank senator markey for his leadership on this issue. there isn't a place i go in my state where i don't hear from a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, a grandmother, a grandfather, a friend about someone who lost a loved one, lost someone they care about, because of heroin, opioids, fentanyl, the deadly combination that is killing people. we have an opportunity, not only with the important work in the comprehensive addiction and recovery act to add more resources to address prevention, treatment, and support for our first responders but also the fda has a very important role, and we need stronger leadership there and greater engagement of our medical community on the best prescribing practices for opioids. to me, this is an opportunity where i would like to see stronger leadership and i would like to hear a much more aggressive stance from this fda. of all the issues we struggle with, the things we disagree on in this body--heroin, fentanyl, they don't care whether you are a republican or a democrat, i can assure my colleagues, or an independent or a libertarian because these drugs are taking everyone's lives. so as i think about all the issues we can come together on, this is one about our public health, about our public safety, about our quality of life, and it requires all of our leadership. there is nothing partisan about this. i hope we will see stronger leadership from the fda. i hope we as a body will build on what the judiciary committee did and bring to the floor the cara bill that many of us have worked hard on and support each other's efforts to do all we can to end this public health crisis and ensure that none of us have to run into families of people in our state whom we represent who are losing people they love to heroin or fentanyl or misuse of opioid prescription drugs. this is devastating. i know we can make a difference. this is something we can make a difference on in this body. i thank the chair. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from massachusetts. mr. markey. mr. president, i want to follow on with the discussion that senator ayotte from new hampshire was bringing to the senate floor. what she is saying is just so accurate in terms of the pervasive nature of this opioid-driven epidemic--pandemic--in the united states of america. it is time for us to come together in a bipartisan fashion to deal with what is now the great medical storm sweeping across this country. there has been a quadrupling of opioid-related deaths in just the last 14 years in our country. this is something that has to be understood. i heard senator ayotte mention it, but we can't say it enough: 80 percent of all people in the united states who die from heroin overdoses begin with prescription painkillers--opioids--that have been given to them by physicians. let me say that again. eighty percent of the people who die from heroin overdoses started on prescription pills. they got addicted to the prescription painkiller. it deals with the same receptors in the brain. it creates the same kind of need in the brain, and when people get addicted to prescription pain medicine, it is ultimately a very short to a product which is much less expensive--heroin--on the streets of the united states. this epidemic has to be dealt with and it has to be dealt with where it starts and it starts at the fda. it starts at the food and drug administration. it starts with the agency that approves these drugs for sale in the united states of america. yes, the fda stands for food and drug administration, but over the last 20 years it really stands for ``fostering drug addiction,'' and it has to end. this is why the nomination right now of dr. robert califf to be the new head of the fda gives us an opportunity to talk about this issue, to talk about where it all starts, how it began, and what we are going to have to do in this body to reverse this trend, which last year led to the deaths of 30,000 people in our country. again, i say to my colleagues that between 2000 and 2014, the heroin overdose death rate has quadrupled in the united states of america. this is something that is recent. it is related to the fda, and we have to now have an honest discussion about the role that agency is playing because we have become the ``united states of oxy.'' we have become a nation of 5 percent of the world's population that consumes 80 percent of the prescription painkillers in the world. this overprescribing, this consumption of oxy and percocet, down the line has led to this epidemic, this contagion that is killing people on a daily basis in our country who otherwise would never have even contemplated using heroin or using any of these other more dangerous drugs. that is why we are here. that is why i am recommending a ``no'' vote on dr. robert califf. the fda has a chance to change its policies. thus far, it is saying it will not change its policies. in 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers. that is enough for every single adult in america to have a bottle of these pills in their medicine cabinet. we should understand as we talk about this that the molecular composition of oxycontin is very similar to heroin. in fact, oxycodone is the sole ingredient in oxycontin. oxycontin stands for oxycodone continuously in the bloodstream of the patient who is taking these pills. it creates this sense that you are able to deal with the pain. it creates this sense that you are being taken care of, but if it is not handled correctly over time, it then creates an addiction, and that addiction then leads to, once you are off these pills, to being out on the street buying the heroin or buying the oxy you need in order to continue this habit. so we have to start to deal with the issue very realistically in terms of this pathway that has been created into the minds of millions of people all across this country. thirteen hundred people died in massachusetts in 2014, of the 30,000 people [[page s935]] in our country, as a result of this issue. we have the fda, going back to the year 1996, accepting the misrepresentation of the pharmaceutical company purdue, which represented to the fda that oxycontin, in its original formulation, was abuse deterrent, meaning that since it was time-released inside of the patient, that, therefore, it was abuse deterrent and it could be prescribed safely to people all across our country. well, it turned out that not only was that a misrepresentation to the fda, but purdue pharma subsequently was fined millions of dollars and its executives punished for the misrepresentation they made to the food and drug administration. that was a brief 20 years ago, but that is pretty much where it all started. that is the original sin--accepting this whole notion of abuse deterrent. let's go to the fda in more recent times. in 2012, there was a new opioid that the fda had to consider for approval. that new opioid's name is zohydro. the fda impaneled 13 experts to examine that drug for the fda. when those 13 experts concluded their examination of the drug by an 11-to-2 vote, the expert advisory panel voted, no, do not allow this new zohydro drug out on to the marketplace. they said the standards for abuse are too low. the standards to deal with addiction are too low. the standards to deal with a diversion of the drug are too low. what did the fda do in 2012? it approved zohydro for sale in the united states over the objections of the advisory panel that had voted 11 to 2 against it--and these are experts. moving forward, the fda decided to reexamine what it was going to do. so when it was considering targiniq, when it was considering hysinla, it decided to solve the problem by having no expert advisory panels which it would convene to examine the impacts of that drug before it got approved. that is a good way to solve the problem--just accept the representations of the company that it had abuse deterrent in it, and then you don't have to worry because you will not have to talk to experts on the outside again. so those two drugs got approved. then, in august of 2015, there was an application by purdue pharma, once again--that company's name just keeps coming back into the equation--they wanted approval to sell oxycontin to children ages 11 to 16. now mind you, the actual standards at the fda require an outside expert panel to look at approval for opioids being sold in america if it is controversial, if it could have a huge social impact in our society. and it specifically says in the fda's own guidelines that if pediatric doses--if the proper dose for a child is involved--then the fda should have an expert panel. what did the fda do? the fda decided no expert panel would examine the appropriateness of oxycontin being prescribed for children ages 11 to 16 in our country--no expert advisory panel, which brings us to the nomination of dr. robert califf. we are now in a process where we are examining his nomination and his qualifications. this senator leaves aside his own personal qualifications. this is not a debate, really, over dr. califf. it is a debate over the agency because the agency is saying--even today as we will be voting on dr. califf's nomination--they will not change. they will not convene expert outside advisory panels to look at this new generation of opioids with abuse deterrents built into them to determine whether or not they are actually appropriately being put into our society. today is the day to begin this debate. this nomination is the occasion that we can use in order to debate what has gone wrong at the food and drug administration. if we don't start with a brandnew definition that gets created for abuse, for addiction, for what the standards should be for the use of these opioids, then this issue is just going to escalate until we are losing a vietnam war's number of people every single year in the united states. this is a pharmaceutical industry-created problem. this is a physician-created problem. this is an fda-created problem. it is created by men and women, and it can be solved by men and women. this is not zika, this is not ebola, and this is not some disease that you can't really point to that is responsible. this is us, this is our country, and this is our culture. we did it. we created this problem. we are 5 percent of the world's population consuming 80 percent of all opioids--crazy. really, it is crazy. we have to finally come to the recognition that this is no longer some inner city heroin epidemic. this disease knows no barrier--racial, income, geography, employment--no barriers at all. it is spread across every single segment of the american population, top to bottom. there is no discrimination whatsoever. we have to decide what we are going to do in order to make sure that we put the proper safeguards in place. senator manchin and i, senators ayotte, sanders, blumenthal, and others have been raising these questions. to the credit of the senate judiciary committee, they are considering legislation to bring to the floor. i thank senators whitehouse, portman, shaheen, ayotte, and senators grassley and leahy for their work on that legislation, but that legislation does not conclude anything on this issue that i am talking about right now. this has to be solved by the fda. that is why this senator has put a hold on this nomination, saying that they will not get this nomination until they change their policies. we are in the eighth year of this administration, and the policies still remain in place. abuse deterrent is really a contradiction in terms. if you take these pills--you are a carpenter or an ironworker, and you have a bad back-- you start taking these oxycontin pills right now, and you take them as they are prescribed, and you keep going month after month after month. you are increasing the likelihood on a daily basis that you are going to become addicted to these pills. we have heard these stories over and over again about the pathway in from family members. they come into the office and talk about the pathway in that their child, husband, or son took. it all starts with the same story. they were given the prescribed pills. right now the industry is saying: don't worry; there is an abuse deterrent. tell that to these family members. tell that to the families who have lost their loved ones. the drugs are not abuse deterrent. it is a contradiction in terms, like jumbo shrimp. there is no such thing. you need to be realistic about what this drug represents once it is consumed over and over again by people in our country who think that because the doctor has given them a bottle of pills, that is going to help them. that is one of the stories we hear over and over again from family members. they say that they question themselves. could they have done more themselves to help their family member before they became addicted? the common theme from each of them is that you have to assume, when a doctor is giving you a bottle of pills for your family member, that it must be good for them. it must be good for them. it turns out that for 30,000 people in 2014, it wasn't good for them. this number is going to continue to escalate because we haven't put tough enough standards on the books in order to deal with these issues. by refusing to convene expert advisory boards to come in and to create the guidance which is going to be needed in our country going forward, we are going to have a continued flood of opioid deaths that could have been stemmed if we had dealt with this issue in the proper fashion. this is not a hypothetical concern. the policy announced last week by the fda would not have guaranteed an advisory panel for oxycontin on the market today. the fda must change its decision not to seek expert advice against the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids. i want to tell a little story. it is a story about one of maybe the five greatest basketball players ever to come out of the state of massachusetts. his name is chris herren. chris became a boston celtic. he was the greatest basketball player in fall river history, was drafted in the first round by the nba, and went to the same college i went to--boston college. in an excerpt of remarks he recently made in dc at the unite to face addiction rally on the national mall, here is what chris herren said: [[page s936]] i truly believe when it comes to prevention and educating our kids, we need to stop focusing on the worst days and start educating about the first day. at 18 years old, on the campus of boston college i was introduced to cocaine. i promised myself one time--just one line. that one line took me 14 years to walk away from. despite myself at 22, my dream came true. i was 33rd pick in the nba draft, but that same year i was introduced to a little yellow pill--a 40 milligram oxycontin that cost a 20 dollar bill. that 40 milligrams turned into 1600 milligrams a day. and that 20 dollars became a $20,000-a-month oxy habit. and just 2 years later, that pill turned into a needle and that needle stayed in my arm for the next 8 years. i often say if you can't find it in your heart to have empathy for someone who is battling their illness, then you must know that he or she has a mother, father, son or daughter that is at home with a broken heart that wants them back. just one pill, lives impacted, some recover and many are lost. another story--kaitlyn oberle from scituate, ma. here is what she says: i have survived a fatal opiate overdose, yet i never abused opiates. on november 13, 2015 i spoke to my 27-year-old brother for the last time. less than 30 minutes after our final conversation, he passed away from an opiate overdose. he was only 16 years old when he first encountered the demon that consumed the better part of his adult life; sadly, that same demon ultimately killed him. injuries from a dirt bike accident left him with two broken arms, a knee injury, and what felt like an unending supply of prescription opiate painkillers. after his bones mended, he was left with an untreated gaping open wound that would never fully heal itself: an opiate addiction. during my brother's recovery he painted a picture for me of how easy it was for him as a high school teenager and student athlete to call his doctor and request refills for his pain pill prescriptions. when he no longer had injuries to substantiate a prescription, he turned to illegal forms of opiates in both pill and intravenous form. unfortunately, the damage to his brain had been done. there are many facets to what may cause someone to become addicted to opiates, and there are equally as many angles of attack before there is substantial progress to a viable solution. mr. senator, i am writing to you because i am a survivor. i've lived through my worst fear by knowing i can be a voice in helping prevent future deaths caused by opiate addiction. as you convene to debate the fitness of dr. robert califf's nomination for head of the food and drug administration, please ask the senate to reflect on his time as deputy commissioner. as second in power at the fda, he has had a chance to do something about these issues. it is time for a change in culture at that agency. a third letter--final letter written by stephen jesi, from malden, ma: i am writing to you as a longtime maldonian and a father of a 33-year-old daughter stephenie who passed away on december 13, 2015 of a heroin overdose. stephenie overdosed on thursday, two days prior to her death and was released by the hospital at 11:39 p.m. on to the streets. we've experienced this first hand many times. thank god for chief campanello of the gloucester police department who picked up the phone, talked to us, talked to stephenie, and assisted us in every way he could to get her into treatment. everybody else just said sorry, there is nothing we can do. i believe that our medical community along with the pharmaceutical industry are grooming and developing drug addicts and putting them right into the hands of the cartels and the drug dealers. way too many prescriptions are written for more narcotics than are necessary after surgeries with no follow up. many of those who are predisposed to addiction, either by genetics or co-existing mental health issues, are easy prey for these drugs that begin as legally prescribed. once they are addicted and can no longer afford the medically prescribed version of the medication they fall into illegal drugs and from there too often the addiction has taken control of their lives. the pharmaceutical industry along with our medical community has to prescribe these highly addictive narcotics much more carefully and offer less addictive medication whenever possible. most patients take these narcotics for just a couple of days after the surgery but are provided a much longer supply where they can easily fall into the hands of the addict. our legislators and government officials cannot be tied to the desires of the pharmaceutical lobbyists. this is the cry that is coming out from every community in america. individuals are saying: how did this happen to my family? how could that accident with the broken leg or the back pain turn into an opioid overdose? how could it have happened? well, it happened because the medical community and the pharmaceutical industry have not put the protections in place for us to be able to deal with it. let me give you this number. this is a crazy number. it is a crazy number. over the last 15, 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of prescription opioid pills that have been allowed to be sold in america. so i am just going to ask people who are listening to this, pick a number. how many 10 milligram prescription opioids were allowed to be made in america last year? just pick a number. we have 300 million people in america. how many of these pills were allowed or given the permission to be made by pharmaceutical companies? here is the answer-- 14 billion. may i say that again--14 billion opioid pills for our country. the numbers are out of control. the overprescribing is out of control. we have to find a way to dramatically reduce the amount of drugs that are being sold legally in our country. before we even reach illegal, you have to start with legal. that is the problem because the drug enforcement administration, the agency responsible for deciding how much each pharmaceutical company can manufacture each year, doesn't even announce how much each company is given permission to manufacture; instead they just announce the gross number of total opioid materials that can be put into pills in our country each year. does anyone understand this in america, that that is the process? the fda allows the company to sell it. then it goes over to the dea. then the dea picks a number of pills that can be sold, and then physicians are allowed to prescribe these pills, but this is the fda's own number. listen to this. the fda asks for voluntary guidelines to be put together for physicians' education so they know what they are doing with these opioids. pick a number in your brain as to how many physicians have voluntarily accepted medical education on the consequences of prescribing opioids. pick a number. here is the correct answer: 10 percent of physicians. that is it. on something that is so catastrophic, something that is creating an epidemic in our country, you would think this would be mandatory; that the medical associations at the state level, the national level had created some kind of mandatory education. it hasn't happened. is it mandatory in medical schools across america that they receive education as to what the consequences are of prescribing opioids? not at all. so who would think a physician would have to be trained in how to handle pain? i mean, a physician is only dealing with the issue all day long, every single day. you would think there would be some understanding then of what the consequences were of the medicines they were prescribing. no courses in medical school are mandated. no courses are mandated after you have graduated, you are practicing medicine, and now you are licensed by the dea to prescribe opiates--no courses. so as we move forward on the legislation that is going to be coming out on the floor of the senate, i intend to make an amendment--senator blumenthal and i tried to make it in the judiciary committee, and we are going to be making it on the senate floor--requiring the drug enforcement administration to require mandatory education for any physician who wants to prescribe these drugs. that is the minimum, the minimum that the medical profession should have to accept as a responsibility before they are allowed to prescribe these drugs. there is another amendment which i am working on with senator paul of kentucky, and that is an amendment that is going to increase access to medication that can help people deal with their addictions. again, that is a classic example of a democrat and republican working together on these issues. senator ayotte and i have an amendment that would create a good samaritan protection for any american, any family member who wants to apply narcan to a family member or someone who has overdosed and would die in the absence of narcan, the antidote, being applied to them. senator ayotte and i are working on that amendment. we are trying hard to find ways where, unfortunately, legislatively we can act. this should have happened at the agencies. this should have happened in the medical profession. we shouldn't be forced to debate this on the senate floor, but it is absolutely, [[page s937]] indispensably necessary for us to take this action. this is the epidemic of our time. the death rates now in the age group that is affected by this epidemic are now declining at the same rates as they did during the war in vietnam. we haven't seen anything like this since the war in vietnam in the death rates--30,000 people-- quadrupling in 14 years, escalating on a daily basis. it is time for the senate to take real action on this issue so we can deal with it. in boston, ma, we had a police chief who saw that something had gone wrong, chief campanello. he said that incarceration doesn't work and instead treatment should be substituted. so beginning last june, what chief campanello said in gloucester, ma, was that if you come in and you are an addict, you have a problem, you come into the police station, bring your drugs with you, we are not going to arrest you, we are going to put you into treatment immediately--no arrests. four hundred people have walked into that police station in gloucester, ma, in just 8 months--400 people. by shifting the paradigm from arrests to treatment, 800 more people--800 total across the country--as city after city, town after town adopts this model, have now accepted that as a better route for them in their lives, to just turn themselves in at the local police stations. he has partnered with a man named john rosenthal. john rosenthal is an activist in our state, and he helps to fund this program. last wednesday night, tragically, john rosenthal's own nephew, nathan huggins-rosenthal, age 34, died of an overdose in calgary, canada. my heart goes out to the rosenthal family because obviously they were committed to dealing with this issue, pioneering ways to have addicts be able to have a place they can go. yet in john rosenthal's own family, his nephew overdosed just last wednesday night. as senator ayotte was saying, there is no neighborhood immunity. there is no family who is completely protected. this epidemic has been created by pharmaceutical companies, by physicians, by the agencies responsible to deal with it, and it is now time for us to put in place the protections which are needed to deal with it. let me give you opioids 101 so you can understand how we get to this--what are opioids, how do they work, and why do they lead to heroin abuse. here is how it works. it starts with a seed pod of the opium poppy. we get the morphine, a naturally occurring opiate pain reliever from that pod seed. the morphine interacts with so-called opioid receptors that are found in high concentrations in areas of the brain that control pain and emotions. taking opiates can increase the levels of dopamine in the brain's reward areas and produce euphoria or a rush of pain relief and relaxation. in fact, morphine, which was first identified in the early 1800s is named after morpheus, the greek god of dreams. in 1895, the bayer corporation, bayer aspirin--the bayer corporation in germany introduced a new cough suppressant marketed as a safer alternative to morphine. this new wonder drug was called heroin. in the 1920s, drug manufacturers began making fully synthetic analogs to morphine. they were called opioids. these drugs contain the same basic chemical framework as morphine, and they have exactly the same mechanism of action in the brain. they share common chemical features that allow them to buy into the brain's opioid receptors, and they all are considered highly addictive. these drugs vary widely in potency. that is the amount of the drug required to reach the same level of pain relief and sedation as morphine. oxycontin, for example, is 150 percent as strong as morphine. heroin is also an opioid. they share the same fundamental chemical structure. heroin binds to the very same receptors in the brain and produces the same euphoria and sedation, and heroin is plagued by the same addiction potential. heroin is classified as a schedule i drug, the most dangerous class, because it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse and addiction. so this is the pathway between opioids and heroin and why that pathway is very short. it is all about the chemistry because oxycontin has the nearly identical molecular constitution as heroin. over time, the brain, the receptors are saying: i need to have to continue to have that hit. thus, we have this epidemic where 80 percent of all people in the united states who are dying from heroin overdoses started on prescription opioid drugs that had been prescribed by their physicians. physicians should have to be educated. the fda should have expert advisory panels that give the strongest possible guidance to the pharmaceutical companies. that is what is missing in this equation. it starts there. we need a debate on $1.1 billion for more treatment and more education, and we are going to have that debate on the senate floor. these local families, these local groups, they are heroes, but heroes need help, and it is time for us to fund those programs in the same way we funded the ebola crisis and the same way we are being asked to help to fund the zika crisis. we have a crisis in america ourselves, but if we don't deal with the issue right from the beginning at the fda, at the dea, and at the ama, we are not going to solve this problem. we are just putting medical facilities in place to deal with the consequences of having no policy. this is our great opportunity to have a debate in our country. i can't thank the members enough for beginning to deal with this issue on a serious basis, but we can't be afraid of the pharmaceutical industry. we can't be afraid of the american medical association. we can't be afraid of the bureaucrats in these agencies who say: oh, mr. or ms. senator, we are the experts. you don't know what you are talking about. well, just let me tell you this. the people of the united states don't trust the experts anymore in these agencies. they want more accountability. they want other experts to come in to check those experts, to ask the tough questions on behalf of the american people. that is why i have a hold on dr. robert califf's nomination for the fda, because right now the fda is saying it is going to continue business as usual and that is just wrong. that is just plain wrong. it has to stop there. the signal must come from this administration. i thank all the members for this discussion, for where we are today and where we are going to have to go in the months ahead, but i don't think we should end this year without a fundamental change that has taken place in our society in this relationship. i will just add one final issue, and that is the issue of how many pills, how many pills a doctor can prescribe initially to a patient. we are now debating that issue in the state of massachusetts. governor baker has been saying it should only be 3 days' worth of pills. one of the counterproposals is 7 days of pills that can be used by the patient. i do know this. we have to start here because right now doctors are handing out bottles of 60 to patients who only need a week's worth or 3 days' worth. when you leave a dentist's office, you don't need 60 days' worth of pills for your wisdom teeth that have been removed. when you have some pain that you just got from playing a softball game and you have twisted your back, you don't need a bottle of 60 or 30. you might need a few pills for 3 days or 7 days, but you don't need the 60. having that 60 in that medicine cabinet is the beginning of the problem. i thank governor baker for what he is doing on this issue. they haven't resolved it in massachusetts. i think we have to debate that in the halls of congress as well. they are all related, how these pills get into the blood system of our country. again, i thank all of the members for their consideration of this issue. mr. president, i yield back the remainder of my time. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. scott). the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. moran. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",77303

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS938-2,CREC-2016-02-23,114,Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia (Executive Calendar),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S938-S939] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of one of our Nation's greatest champions of limited government under the Constitution, Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia set the standard for the kind of judge upon which liberty depends. He was a dear friend, and I will miss him greatly. The purpose of government, according to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, is to secure inalienable rights and the blessings of liberty. Liberty exists by design and, as Andrew Jackson put it, by eternal vigilance. America's Founders were clear that liberty requires separated and limited government powers, including a particular role for unelected judges. Judges who seek to determine what the law is promote liberty; judges who say what they think the law should be undermine it. Put simply, judges must interpret and apply the law impartially; that is, by setting aside their own opinions, preferences, or prejudices. Interpreting and applying the law impartially particularly leaves the American people and their elected representatives in charge of the law. When they interpret written law impartially, they discern what the original public meaning of the law is. When judges apply the law impartially, they pay no regard to the identity of the parties or the political effects of their decision. Judges can neither make nor change the law they use to decide cases. That is the kind of judge liberty requires. That is the kind of judge Antonin Scalia was. When President Ronald Reagan first appointed Antonin Scalia to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in 1982, the future Justice said to those of us on the Judiciary Committee that if confirmed the time for him to opine on the wisdom of laws would be ``bygone days.'' When he again came before the committee a few years later as a Supreme Court nominee, he repeated that setting aside personal views is ``one of the primary qualifications for a judge.'' He described a ``good judge'' as one who starts from the law itself and not ``where I would like to come out in [a] particular case.'' Justice Scalia's brilliance and wit were certainly impressive, but they were powerfully connected to this deeply considered and deliberately framed judicial philosophy rooted in the principles of the Constitution. He stuck doggedly to this ideal of the good judge whose role in our system of government is limited to properly interpreting the law and impartially applying it to decide cases. His approach requires self-restraint by judges. Judges, he often said, must take the law as they find it and apply it even when they do not like the results. In his own words, ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach.'' Liberty requires such judicial self-restraint, whether it is en vogue or not. As President Reagan put it when he witnessed the oath of office administered to Justice Scalia in September 1986, America's Founders intended that the judiciary be independent and strong but also confined within the boundaries of a written Constitution and laws. No one believed that principle more deeply and insisted on implementing it more consistently than our Justice Scalia. His approach to the law was often called textualism or, in the constitutional context, originalism--an approach which is nothing more than determining the original public meaning of the legal text. It leaves the lawmaking to the lawmakers and the people they represent, rather than to the judge. The Senate unanimously confirmed Justice Scalia's nomination on September 17, 1986, the 199th anniversary of the Constitution's ratification. That was very appropriate because his approach gives the Constitution its real due, treating it as more than empty words on a page but as words that already have meaning and substance. Justice Scalia knew that the Constitution cannot limit government's power if government actors--including judges--define the Constitution. Justice Scalia rejected judicial activism--what he called power- judging--that treats the law as shape-shifting. For activists, the laws and the Constitution have no fixed meaning but can rather be contorted and manipulated to fit the judge's own policy preference. Such an approach puts the unelected judge, not the American people in their elected representatives, in the position of supreme lawmaker. Thomas Jefferson warned that if judges controlled the Constitution's meaning, it would be ``a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.'' That is exactly what activist judges do, treating the law like clay that they can mold in their own image. Rather than reinterpreting the law in his own image, the good judge conforms his decisions to the fixed meaning of the law. By insisting that even judges must be the servants rather than the masters of the law, Justice Scalia was simply following the lead of America's Founders and empowering the American people. Justice Scalia's approach to judging not only requires self-restraint by judges, but it also demands rigor and accountability by legislators. The good judge takes seriously the language the legislators enact, so the people can hold accountable the legislators they elect. The famed Senator and Supreme Court advocate Daniel Webster once said that ``there are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.'' Those who object to Justice Scalia's approach embrace the notion that judges, rather than the people, should be the masters of the law. Justice Scalia's impact has been enormous. A liberal legal commentator may have put it best in his review of Justice Scalia's book, ``A Matter of Interpretation,'' with these words: We are all originalists now. That is to say, most judges and legal scholars who want to remain within the boundaries of respectable constitutional discourse agree that the original meaning of the Constitution and its amendment has some degree of pertinence to the question of what the Constitution means today. Justice Scalia brought the boundaries of respectable constitutional discourse more in line with the principles of liberty than they had been in a generation. For that, our liberty is more secure, and we should be deeply grateful. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia and Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this past Saturday I was honored to attend the funeral mass for Justice Scalia. I couldn't help but recall back when President Reagan nominated him for the Supreme Court of the United States. At that time Judge Scalia said that ``[his] only [agenda] was to be a good judge.'' Today, 30 years later, it is clear that Justice Scalia, who until his death served longer than any of the current members of the Supreme Court of the United States, was more than a good judge. In fact, he was a great judge. He was a giant of American jurisprudence. As I got to know him even better during the course of the more recent years, thanks to a mutual acquaintance, I can tell you he was also a good man. My first encounter with Justice Scalia was back in 1991 when I won an election to be on the Texas Supreme Court and the court invited Justice Scalia to come to Austin, TX, and administer the oath of office. At that time I already admired his intellect [[Page S939]] and commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law, and believe me, he was an inspiration to young judges like me who were inspired to do the same. He has been an inspiration to so many judges, lawyers, and law students for decades. I admired and respected Justice Scalia. Like many Texans, I was proud of the fact that he also seemed to love Texas, believe it or not, even though he was a Virginian. He remarked once that if he didn't live in Virginia, he would ``probably want to be a Texan.'' I wish to spend a couple of minutes remembering this great man and the contributions he made to our Nation. Beyond his incredible resume, Justice Scalia was a devoted husband to Maureen for more than 50 years. He was a dedicated father to 9 children and a grandfather to more than 30 grandchildren. As I said earlier, he was not only a family man, which I am sure he would have considered his most important job, he was a role model for a generation of lawyers, judges, legal scholars, and those who loved the Constitution. One of the interesting things about Justice Scalia--and perhaps he could teach all of us a little something these days--was that he was quick to build relationships with people who had different views from his own and fostered an environment of collegiality and friendship on the Court. As we learned earlier, Justice Scalia had relationships with people with whom he couldn't have disagreed more on key issues that the Court confronted--people like Justice Ginsburg, for example. We all know he was a gifted writer and possessed an infectious wit, but Justice Scalia's most important legacy is his life's work and his call for a return to our constitutional first principles. Justice Scalia strongly believed that words mattered, and I think that is one of the reasons why he quickly became one of the most memorable writers on the Court and one of the best in the Court's entire history. He believed the words written in the Constitution mattered because that was the only thing the States voted on when they ratified the Constitution. Those were the words with which the American people chose to govern themselves. For decades he tried to give those words force and fought against an attempt to say that we really don't have a written Constitution; we have a living Constitution that should be reinterpreted based on the times when, indeed, the text had not changed one bit. His originalist interpretation of the Constitution meant that he viewed the Court as a place to vindicate the law and what it meant, not express the preferences of five Justices. Justice Scalia was one of the most fervent advocates for the rule of law and a written Constitution. On many instances, he made the important point that if the Supreme Court was viewed merely as a group of nine individuals making value judgments on how our country ought to be governed under our Constitution, then the people may well feel that their values were equally as valid as those of the ``high nine'' on the Potomac given life tenure and a seat on the Supreme Court. It was his strict adherence to the text of the Constitution, and not evolving value judgments over time, that gave protection to our democracy. Justice Scalia was strongly committed to the separation of powers. This is so fundamental to the Constitution that, until the first Congress, James Madison didn't even think that we needed a Bill of Rights because he felt that the separation of powers and the division of responsibilities would be protection enough because they viewed the concentration of powers, the opposite of separation of powers, as a threat to our very liberty. I think he said that the very definition of tyranny was the concentration of powers. So he saw the separation of powers as nothing less than the most important guarantor of our liberty and the most important shield against tyranny. In one dissent Justice Scalia wrote ``without a secure structure of separated powers, our Bill of Rights would be worthless.'' I guess you would have to say he is a Madisonian and not a Federalist by temperament and view. This recognition of the importance of separation of powers could not be any more important at this point in our history because scarcely a month goes by when this administration has chosen to undermine this basic constitutional precept by exerting itself and claiming authorities which the Constitution does not give the President. Justice Scalia understood what was at stake. He believed that every blow to the separation of powers would harm our Republic and liberty itself. As Justice Scalia wrote in a case in which the Court unanimously struck down the President's violations of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, he said: ``We should therefore take every opportunity to affirm the primacy of the Constitution's enduring principles over the politics of the moment.'' He continued, warning against ``aggrandizing the Presidency beyond its constitutional bounds.'' That is what Justice Scalia did time and again, and that is what he reminded all of us about--the importance of doctrines of separation of powers, adherence to the text of the Constitution, and not making it up as you are going along or expressing value judgments that can't be related to the actual text and original understanding of the Constitution. The question arises: When the President makes a nomination to fill the vacancy left by Justice Scalia's death, what is the constitutional responsibility of the U.S. Senate? It is true that under our Constitution, the President of the United States has a unique role and the authority to make a nomination to fill this vacancy, but it is also true that the Senate has an essential and unique role to play as well. The founding generation regarded the Senate's role in the appointment process as ``a critical protection against `despotism.' '' Nothing less. That means that the U.S. Senate has a unique and separate role to play, and certainly a coequal role with that of the President, in the process of filling vacancies on the Court. We are not, and the Constitution never intended us to be, a rubber stamp for the President of the United States. I know that President Obama would love to nominate somebody in the waning months of his last term of office as he is heading out the door and perhaps fill this vacancy, which in the case of Justice Scalia was filled for 30 years, far extending President Obama's term of office. That is not what the U.S. Senate is about. We are a coequal branch of government, and we have an independent and separate responsibility from that of the President. He can nominate anybody he wants, but it is up to the Senate, in its collective wisdom, on whether or not to grant advice and consent. When we say that, we mean that if the Senate did not play its unique role, liberty itself would be weakened and despotism strengthened. As I said before, the American people can and should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice. In the waning days of this Presidential election year after voters have already cast their ballots in primaries for Republican and Democratic candidates--even as I speak, there is a caucus convening today in Nevada--I believe giving the American people a choice in who selects the next Justice of the Supreme Court is very important. I think it elevates what is at stake in this next election this November, and that means simply that this vacancy should not be filled at this time by this President. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from California.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S938-S939] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of one of our Nation's greatest champions of limited government under the Constitution, Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia set the standard for the kind of judge upon which liberty depends. He was a dear friend, and I will miss him greatly. The purpose of government, according to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, is to secure inalienable rights and the blessings of liberty. Liberty exists by design and, as Andrew Jackson put it, by eternal vigilance. America's Founders were clear that liberty requires separated and limited government powers, including a particular role for unelected judges. Judges who seek to determine what the law is promote liberty; judges who say what they think the law should be undermine it. Put simply, judges must interpret and apply the law impartially; that is, by setting aside their own opinions, preferences, or prejudices. Interpreting and applying the law impartially particularly leaves the American people and their elected representatives in charge of the law. When they interpret written law impartially, they discern what the original public meaning of the law is. When judges apply the law impartially, they pay no regard to the identity of the parties or the political effects of their decision. Judges can neither make nor change the law they use to decide cases. That is the kind of judge liberty requires. That is the kind of judge Antonin Scalia was. When President Ronald Reagan first appointed Antonin Scalia to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in 1982, the future Justice said to those of us on the Judiciary Committee that if confirmed the time for him to opine on the wisdom of laws would be ``bygone days.'' When he again came before the committee a few years later as a Supreme Court nominee, he repeated that setting aside personal views is ``one of the primary qualifications for a judge.'' He described a ``good judge'' as one who starts from the law itself and not ``where I would like to come out in [a] particular case.'' Justice Scalia's brilliance and wit were certainly impressive, but they were powerfully connected to this deeply considered and deliberately framed judicial philosophy rooted in the principles of the Constitution. He stuck doggedly to this ideal of the good judge whose role in our system of government is limited to properly interpreting the law and impartially applying it to decide cases. His approach requires self-restraint by judges. Judges, he often said, must take the law as they find it and apply it even when they do not like the results. In his own words, ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach.'' Liberty requires such judicial self-restraint, whether it is en vogue or not. As President Reagan put it when he witnessed the oath of office administered to Justice Scalia in September 1986, America's Founders intended that the judiciary be independent and strong but also confined within the boundaries of a written Constitution and laws. No one believed that principle more deeply and insisted on implementing it more consistently than our Justice Scalia. His approach to the law was often called textualism or, in the constitutional context, originalism--an approach which is nothing more than determining the original public meaning of the legal text. It leaves the lawmaking to the lawmakers and the people they represent, rather than to the judge. The Senate unanimously confirmed Justice Scalia's nomination on September 17, 1986, the 199th anniversary of the Constitution's ratification. That was very appropriate because his approach gives the Constitution its real due, treating it as more than empty words on a page but as words that already have meaning and substance. Justice Scalia knew that the Constitution cannot limit government's power if government actors--including judges--define the Constitution. Justice Scalia rejected judicial activism--what he called power- judging--that treats the law as shape-shifting. For activists, the laws and the Constitution have no fixed meaning but can rather be contorted and manipulated to fit the judge's own policy preference. Such an approach puts the unelected judge, not the American people in their elected representatives, in the position of supreme lawmaker. Thomas Jefferson warned that if judges controlled the Constitution's meaning, it would be ``a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.'' That is exactly what activist judges do, treating the law like clay that they can mold in their own image. Rather than reinterpreting the law in his own image, the good judge conforms his decisions to the fixed meaning of the law. By insisting that even judges must be the servants rather than the masters of the law, Justice Scalia was simply following the lead of America's Founders and empowering the American people. Justice Scalia's approach to judging not only requires self-restraint by judges, but it also demands rigor and accountability by legislators. The good judge takes seriously the language the legislators enact, so the people can hold accountable the legislators they elect. The famed Senator and Supreme Court advocate Daniel Webster once said that ``there are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.'' Those who object to Justice Scalia's approach embrace the notion that judges, rather than the people, should be the masters of the law.

I guess you would have to say he is a Madisonian and not a Federalist by temperament and view. This recognition of the importance of separation of powers could not be any more important at this point in our history because scarcely a month goes by when this administration has chosen to undermine this basic constitutional precept by exerting itself and claiming authorities which the Constitution does not give the President. Justice Scalia understood what was at stake. He believed that every blow to the separation of powers would harm our Republic and liberty itself. As Justice Scalia wrote in a case in which the Court unanimously struck down the President's violations of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, he said: ``We should therefore take every opportunity to affirm the primacy of the Constitution's enduring principles over the politics of the moment.'' He continued, warning against ``aggrandizing the Presidency beyond its constitutional bounds.'' That is what Justice Scalia did time and again, and that is what he reminded all of us about--the importance of doctrines of separation of powers, adherence to the text of the Constitution, and not making it up as you are going along or expressing value judgments that can't be related to the actual text and original understanding of the Constitution. The question arises: When the President makes a nomination to fill the vacancy left by Justice Scalia's death, what is the constitutional responsibility of the U.S. Senate? It is true that under our Constitution, the President of the United States has a unique role and the authority to make a nomination to fill this vacancy, but it is also true that the Senate has an essential and unique role to play as well. The founding generation regarded the Senate's role in the appointment process as ``a critical protection against `despotism.' '' Nothing less. That means that the U.S. Senate has a unique and separate role to play, and certainly a coequal role with that of the President, in the process of filling vacancies on the Court. We are not, and the Constitution never intended us to be, a rubber stamp for the President of the United States. I know that President Obama would love to nominate somebody in the waning months of his last term of office as he is heading out the door and perhaps fill this vacancy, which in the case of Justice Scalia was filled for 30 years, far extending President Obama's term of office. That is not what the U.S. Senate is about. We are a coequal branch of government, and we have an independent and separate responsibility from that of the President. He can nominate anybody he wants, but it is up to the Senate, in its collective wisdom, on whether or not to grant advice and consent. When we say that, we mean that if the Senate did not play its unique role, liberty itself would be weakened and despotism strengthened. As I said before, the American people can and should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice. In the waning days of this Presidential election year after voters have already cast their ballots in primaries for Republican and Democratic candidates--even as I speak, there is a caucus convening today in Nevada--I believe giving the American people a choice in who selects the next Justice of the Supreme Court is very important. I think it elevates what is at stake in this next election this November, and that means simply that this vacancy should not be filled at this time by this President. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from California.",package_114_144.csv,15625,15625,15696,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [senate] [pages s938-s939] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] remembering justice antonin scalia mr. hatch. mr. president, i rise to honor the memory of one of our nation's greatest champions of limited government under the constitution, justice antonin scalia. justice scalia set the standard for the kind of judge upon which liberty depends. he was a dear friend, and i will miss him greatly. the purpose of government, according to the declaration of independence and the constitution, is to secure inalienable rights and the blessings of liberty. liberty exists by design and, as andrew jackson put it, by eternal vigilance. america's founders were clear that liberty requires separated and limited government powers, including a particular role for unelected judges. judges who seek to determine what the law is promote liberty; judges who say what they think the law should be undermine it. put simply, judges must interpret and apply the law impartially; that is, by setting aside their own opinions, preferences, or prejudices. interpreting and applying the law impartially particularly leaves the american people and their elected representatives in charge of the law. when they interpret written law impartially, they discern what the original public meaning of the law is. when judges apply the law impartially, they pay no regard to the identity of the parties or the political effects of their decision. judges can neither make nor change the law they use to decide cases. that is the kind of judge liberty requires. that is the kind of judge antonin scalia was. when president ronald reagan first appointed antonin scalia to the u.s. court of appeals for the dc circuit in 1982, the future justice said to those of us on the judiciary committee that if confirmed the time for him to opine on the wisdom of laws would be ``bygone days.'' when he again came before the committee a few years later as a supreme court nominee, he repeated that setting aside personal views is ``one of the primary qualifications for a judge.'' he described a ``good judge'' as one who starts from the law itself and not ``where i would like to come out in [a] particular case.'' justice scalia's brilliance and wit were certainly impressive, but they were powerfully connected to this deeply considered and deliberately framed judicial philosophy rooted in the principles of the constitution. he stuck doggedly to this ideal of the good judge whose role in our system of government is limited to properly interpreting the law and impartially applying it to decide cases. his approach requires self-restraint by judges. judges, he often said, must take the law as they find it and apply it even when they do not like the results. in his own words, ``if you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach.'' liberty requires such judicial self-restraint, whether it is en vogue or not. as president reagan put it when he witnessed the oath of office administered to justice scalia in september 1986, america's founders intended that the judiciary be independent and strong but also confined within the boundaries of a written constitution and laws. no one believed that principle more deeply and insisted on implementing it more consistently than our justice scalia. his approach to the law was often called textualism or, in the constitutional context, originalism--an approach which is nothing more than determining the original public meaning of the legal text. it leaves the lawmaking to the lawmakers and the people they represent, rather than to the judge. the senate unanimously confirmed justice scalia's nomination on september 17, 1986, the 199th anniversary of the constitution's ratification. that was very appropriate because his approach gives the constitution its real due, treating it as more than empty words on a page but as words that already have meaning and substance. justice scalia knew that the constitution cannot limit government's power if government actors--including judges--define the constitution. justice scalia rejected judicial activism--what he called power- judging--that treats the law as shape-shifting. for activists, the laws and the constitution have no fixed meaning but can rather be contorted and manipulated to fit the judge's own policy preference. such an approach puts the unelected judge, not the american people in their elected representatives, in the position of supreme lawmaker. thomas jefferson warned that if judges controlled the constitution's meaning, it would be ``a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.'' that is exactly what activist judges do, treating the law like clay that they can mold in their own image. rather than reinterpreting the law in his own image, the good judge conforms his decisions to the fixed meaning of the law. by insisting that even judges must be the servants rather than the masters of the law, justice scalia was simply following the lead of america's founders and empowering the american people. justice scalia's approach to judging not only requires self-restraint by judges, but it also demands rigor and accountability by legislators. the good judge takes seriously the language the legislators enact, so the people can hold accountable the legislators they elect. the famed senator and supreme court advocate daniel webster once said that ``there are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern. they promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.'' those who object to justice scalia's approach embrace the notion that judges, rather than the people, should be the masters of the law. justice scalia's impact has been enormous. a liberal legal commentator may have put it best in his review of justice scalia's book, ``a matter of interpretation,'' with these words: we are all originalists now. that is to say, most judges and legal scholars who want to remain within the boundaries of respectable constitutional discourse agree that the original meaning of the constitution and its amendment has some degree of pertinence to the question of what the constitution means today. justice scalia brought the boundaries of respectable constitutional discourse more in line with the principles of liberty than they had been in a generation. for that, our liberty is more secure, and we should be deeply grateful. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. remembering justice antonin scalia and filling the supreme court vacancy mr. cornyn. mr. president, this past saturday i was honored to attend the funeral mass for justice scalia. i couldn't help but recall back when president reagan nominated him for the supreme court of the united states. at that time judge scalia said that ``[his] only [agenda] was to be a good judge.'' today, 30 years later, it is clear that justice scalia, who until his death served longer than any of the current members of the supreme court of the united states, was more than a good judge. in fact, he was a great judge. he was a giant of american jurisprudence. as i got to know him even better during the course of the more recent years, thanks to a mutual acquaintance, i can tell you he was also a good man. my first encounter with justice scalia was back in 1991 when i won an election to be on the texas supreme court and the court invited justice scalia to come to austin, tx, and administer the oath of office. at that time i already admired his intellect [[page s939]] and commitment to the constitution and the rule of law, and believe me, he was an inspiration to young judges like me who were inspired to do the same. he has been an inspiration to so many judges, lawyers, and law students for decades. i admired and respected justice scalia. like many texans, i was proud of the fact that he also seemed to love texas, believe it or not, even though he was a virginian. he remarked once that if he didn't live in virginia, he would ``probably want to be a texan.'' i wish to spend a couple of minutes remembering this great man and the contributions he made to our nation. beyond his incredible resume, justice scalia was a devoted husband to maureen for more than 50 years. he was a dedicated father to 9 children and a grandfather to more than 30 grandchildren. as i said earlier, he was not only a family man, which i am sure he would have considered his most important job, he was a role model for a generation of lawyers, judges, legal scholars, and those who loved the constitution. one of the interesting things about justice scalia--and perhaps he could teach all of us a little something these days--was that he was quick to build relationships with people who had different views from his own and fostered an environment of collegiality and friendship on the court. as we learned earlier, justice scalia had relationships with people with whom he couldn't have disagreed more on key issues that the court confronted--people like justice ginsburg, for example. we all know he was a gifted writer and possessed an infectious wit, but justice scalia's most important legacy is his life's work and his call for a return to our constitutional first principles. justice scalia strongly believed that words mattered, and i think that is one of the reasons why he quickly became one of the most memorable writers on the court and one of the best in the court's entire history. he believed the words written in the constitution mattered because that was the only thing the states voted on when they ratified the constitution. those were the words with which the american people chose to govern themselves. for decades he tried to give those words force and fought against an attempt to say that we really don't have a written constitution; we have a living constitution that should be reinterpreted based on the times when, indeed, the text had not changed one bit. his originalist interpretation of the constitution meant that he viewed the court as a place to vindicate the law and what it meant, not express the preferences of five justices. justice scalia was one of the most fervent advocates for the rule of law and a written constitution. on many instances, he made the important point that if the supreme court was viewed merely as a group of nine individuals making value judgments on how our country ought to be governed under our constitution, then the people may well feel that their values were equally as valid as those of the ``high nine'' on the potomac given life tenure and a seat on the supreme court. it was his strict adherence to the text of the constitution, and not evolving value judgments over time, that gave protection to our democracy. justice scalia was strongly committed to the separation of powers. this is so fundamental to the constitution that, until the first congress, james madison didn't even think that we needed a bill of rights because he felt that the separation of powers and the division of responsibilities would be protection enough because they viewed the concentration of powers, the opposite of separation of powers, as a threat to our very liberty. i think he said that the very definition of tyranny was the concentration of powers. so he saw the separation of powers as nothing less than the most important guarantor of our liberty and the most important shield against tyranny. in one dissent justice scalia wrote ``without a secure structure of separated powers, our bill of rights would be worthless.'' i guess you would have to say he is a madisonian and not a federalist by temperament and view. this recognition of the importance of separation of powers could not be any more important at this point in our history because scarcely a month goes by when this administration has chosen to undermine this basic constitutional precept by exerting itself and claiming authorities which the constitution does not give the president. justice scalia understood what was at stake. he believed that every blow to the separation of powers would harm our republic and liberty itself. as justice scalia wrote in a case in which the court unanimously struck down the president's violations of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, he said: ``we should therefore take every opportunity to affirm the primacy of the constitution's enduring principles over the politics of the moment.'' he continued, warning against ``aggrandizing the presidency beyond its constitutional bounds.'' that is what justice scalia did time and again, and that is what he reminded all of us about--the importance of doctrines of separation of powers, adherence to the text of the constitution, and not making it up as you are going along or expressing value judgments that can't be related to the actual text and original understanding of the constitution. the question arises: when the president makes a nomination to fill the vacancy left by justice scalia's death, what is the constitutional responsibility of the u.s. senate? it is true that under our constitution, the president of the united states has a unique role and the authority to make a nomination to fill this vacancy, but it is also true that the senate has an essential and unique role to play as well. the founding generation regarded the senate's role in the appointment process as ``a critical protection against `despotism.'

Mr. President, I came to the floor because I am stunned. I just learned that the Republicans have announced to the country they will not even call a hearing, if and when President Obama does his job and nominates a replacement for Justice Scalia. We send our heartfelt sympathy to his family. I don't know where the Republicans have come up with this notion that this is the right thing to do. If you look at the strict constitutionalists, you know they are reading the Constitution, unless they are phonies. This is what the Constitution says, the President shall ``nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court.'' Where in this does it say: except in election years. As a matter of fact, we have acted 14 times in election years. [[Page S940]] Whoever is a strict constructionist should read the Constitution, article II, section 2, clause 2. I am going to read it again: The President shall ``nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court.'' It doesn't say as Senator Cornyn said: Oh, the President can nominate, but nobody else has a job to do. Oh no. It says: ``. . . and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate . . .'' To have such a press conference, as I understand it--I didn't see it myself, but it has been reported to me--there has been an announcement that the Republicans will not even hold a hearing, which goes against this Constitution. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a lawsuit brought by the people of this country, 70 percent of whom believe we have an obligation. We have an obligation. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say it is too late for the President to nominate. Guess what. The Republicans keep saying we need an elected President. Well, I have good news for them. This President was elected twice and he has about a year left. Guess what. I am not going to run again, but I am here now. I want to work. I did not take this job to have a year off and not worry about working in my last year. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say: Oh, and by the way, don't advise and consent if it is a Democratic President in his second term. It does not say that. So if you consider yourself a strict constructionist, then pay attention to this. I am proud that several Republicans on the other side said: Baloney, we don't go along with it. Good for them and more should do it. It doesn't say in the Constitution, you only advise and consent if it is a Republican President with a Republican Senate. Again, the Senate over the years has repeatedly considered Supreme Court nominees in both election years and in the final year of a President's term. Justice Kennedy, who serves now, a fellow Californian, was nominated by President Reagan in 1987. I was over on the House side, and I didn't have anything to do with it, but I sure watched it. Kennedy was confirmed by a Democratic Senate during Reagan's last year in office. My Republican friends say: Oh, but this Senator said this about it and that Senator said that and Joe Biden said this. It doesn't matter what people say. It is what we do, and 14 times in history we have voted on judges in an election year. My Republican colleagues who suggest that this process cannot be done before President Obama leaves office are fooling themselves. History has disproven them and the Constitution is going to chastise whoever says: I want a dead Constitution. Read this. This is very clear. It absolutely is. So I have a message for my Republican friends. Pretty simple. Pretty simple. Do your job. Do your job. If you are afraid to do your job, then do something else with your life. If you don't want to do your job because you are worried that one moderate may get through, then make your argument. If you want to vote no, vote no, but to hold a press conference and say you will not even hold a hearing is outrageous. Every day in talented cities across this country, Americans show up for work and they do their jobs. They don't call their bosses and say: You know, I just don't feel like doing this today. I am healthy, I am fine, I am well, but you know what, I don't want to do my job. They would be fired and they should be. Do your job. You are elected to do your job. The American people show up for their jobs. They do their jobs. It is as simple as that. The Justices of the Supreme Court show up and they do their jobs every day. Justice Scalia did it. They all do it. They hear cases. They write opinions. The Supreme Court is the last stop on the justice train, but to be able to function as our Founding Fathers in the U.S. Constitution intended, they need a full bench with all nine Justices. A Supreme Court with eight Justices is not a functioning Court. Let us look at the Republicans' hero, Ronald Reagan. We always hear them say: Ronald Reagan. I was proud to serve in the House during Ronald Reagan's term. I didn't agree with him on a lot of things, but I agree with him on this. Do you know what he said? I look forward to prompt hearings conducted in the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship. I will do everything in my power as President to assist in that process. President Ronald Reagan, November 12, 1987. What did he say? Did he get up and say: Oh, it is an election year--which it was. No. Kennedy was voted on in an election year and President Reagan made the case. This is what else Ronald Reagan said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' Let me say that again. Ronald Reagan, who was pushing for a vote on a Supreme Court Justice in an election year, said the following: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' I don't understand where the Republicans are coming from. They are disregarding Ronald Reagan, their hero. They are disregarding the Constitution that they say is their shining star of their being, which it should be for all of us, and they stood there today and blatantly announced they are not even going to hold a hearing on a nominee before they even know who he or she is. What is that about? I am truly stunned. I thought I had seen everything, but I have never seen this. You show up and you do your job. I am going to show you a few other quotes of people who are very important to this conversation and what they are saying about not moving forward. How about Sandra Day O'Connor, what an incredible woman. She was appointed by Ronald Reagan, the first female ever appointed to the Supreme Court, a magnificent person and a Republican. What did she say? ``I think we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' She just said that 10 days ago or less. Is she a partisan? I don't think so. She is speaking from the heart. She is speaking from her soul. She is speaking from experience. She knows the Court has important cases before it and will be tied in knots if we don't have a Court at full strength. Again, here is what she said, Republican Sandra Day O'Connor, esteemed member of the Supreme Court, a Ronald Reagan nominee: ``I think we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' I am going to show you two more quotes. This is from the American Constitution Society: A vacancy on the Court for a year and a half, which is what the Republicans want, at least a year and a half, would mean many instances where the Court could not resolve a split among the circuits. There would be the very undesirable result that the same federal law would have differing meanings in various parts of the country. That is the American Constitution Society. Then we have another quote I wish to share with you by the director of the Byron White Center at the University of Colorado: It would essentially shut the Supreme Court down for two years. It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve large legal questions. Let me say it again. It would essentially shut the Supreme Court down for two years. It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve large legal questions. It is not as if large legal questions aren't at stake. Right now the Supreme Court is set to look at some incredibly important cases that have real effects on our people. This isn't some argument in a salon. This is real stuff. The cases can't wait, and it doesn't matter what side you are on with these cases. They have to be resolved. What about voting rights? I don't think there would be a difference of opinion in this Chamber that this is what makes this country great and special, the right to vote, the responsibility to vote. We have many States that have put forward voter ID laws. They need to be told whether they are fair or unfair, whatever side you come down on. We need a Court to look at voting rights cases and see who the eligible voters are. Affirmative action. They are going to reexamine that case. Whatever side you are on, it has to be decided. [[Page S941]] Workers' rights. The Court will decide the impact of the ability of the union to represent millions of working Americans. Whatever side you are on, there needs to be a decision, otherwise you are going to have different States with different laws and it makes no sense. This is one Nation under God. That is why we have a U.S. Senate and a U.S. House and a U.S. President and a U.S. Supreme Court--because we are one Nation and these issues have to be decided. There is one on employee discrimination. How do people get their day in court if they are being discriminated against? It doesn't matter what side you are on. The fact is there needs to be a decision. Women's health. There is a big case on women's health as to whether workers can get birth control. Again, whatever side you are on, pro, con, there needs to be a decision. It is about women, health care, voting rights, students. These cases have real consequences. I am going to conclude with one more chart that deals with the length of Supreme Court Justices for the past 35 years. Here you see the list of the various nominees. Not all of these made it, a couple did not, but here is the deal with these. O'Connor waited 95 days, Rehnquist 92, Scalia 82, Bork 109, Kennedy 113, Souter 74, Thomas 110, Ginsburg 137, Breyer 114, Roberts 90, Alito 95, Sotomayor 97, Kagan 118. Under Mitch McConnell's plan, the Republican plan that they laid out, if you averaged all of this, you get 102 days. That is the average it takes. Under McConnell's plan, it would take 444 days, at best. That is assuming everything goes perfectly well. It could take a lot longer. What does this mean? Anyone within the sound of my voice has heard this: Justice delayed is justice denied. That is a fact. And it is used throughout the country when we talk about the importance of making these decisions. When our constituents go to jury duty, what are they asked? Can you make this decision? Can you come to this decision? Because everyone deserves to have an answer. So, in conclusion, take a look at this. This is an abomination. This is the number of days we have seen over the last 35 years that it took to confirm. Fourteen of our Justices have been confirmed in election years since the beginning of this country, and this takes us back to the Civil War days--imagine--when we really had a country divided. This is not what we need to do right now, with all of these decisions coming up. Regardless of your stand on them, people deserve justice. I will conclude with the ``Do Your Job'' chart because I have to say that is what it comes down to. I urge the people of this great country to call the Republicans, every one of them, with three words: Do your job. And if the person who answers says ``I don't know what you mean,'' say ``Do your job. Let the process move forward on the Supreme Court Justice.'' And if they say ``Well, we want an elected President,'' what will be told to them is ``We are fortunate. We have one, elected not once but twice.'' More than enough time remains for him to do his job, and more than enough time remains for us to do ours. Republicans, do your job. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance of filling the current vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. I appreciate the words of my colleague from California. I wish to begin by saying that my prayers and thoughts are with the family and friends and Supreme Court colleagues of Justice Scalia. He was a great scholar who had friends in many places. Just last week I was at the University of Chicago Law School, where I went to law school, and so many people have stories. He used to teach there. He taught there for a long period of time, and they miss him very much. The Supreme Court has the constitutional responsibility to weigh some of the most important issues facing the American people. From freedom of speech, to due process, to doing business in America, Supreme Court decisions have impacted and continue to impact the daily life of every citizen of this country. As one of the three pillars of our government, we value the Court's distinctive insulation from public opinion. Justices commit themselves to the law and to the Constitution and not to politics or partisanship. Americans need and deserve to have a functional and fully staffed Supreme Court. We cannot delay consideration of the next Supreme Court nominee. As my colleague just pointed out, we would have to go back to the Civil War, to a time where a position--an important key position on the Supreme Court of the United States--was left open. We would have to go back to a time when it was left open for more than a year. We would have to go back to a time before we had planes, before we had automobiles, before we had washing machines--you name it. We would have to go back to the Civil War. Delaying the confirmation of a new Justice will prevent the Court from issuing binding precedent and deny access to justice for Americans. Lower courts will be left with decisions, and decisions will not be made in those cases. That is why the Constitution of the United States says that the President shall--shall--nominate someone to the Supreme Court. It doesn't say that he will wait for a year. It doesn't say that he can't do it in an election year. It says that he shall nominate someone. We have a lot of Members of this great body who are lawyers, a lot of whom I have heard quoting the Constitution. A lot of them believe in strict interpretation of the words of the Constitution. Well, the words of the Constitution say that the President ``shall nominate'' and that the Senate's job is to ``advise and consent.'' It says that it is the Senate's job. It doesn't say that it is the Senate's job to avoid things and to just go on TV and to run ads. No. It says that the Senate has a job to do. The Senate has a job to do. Both the President and the Senate have a constitutional duty to protect the Supreme Court's ability to function and dispense justice-- not to tell the Supreme Court what to do, not to dictate their decisions, but to make sure they are simply able to do justice. This means they must be fully staffed and have the Justices in place, and it also means they should be funded. Those are our jobs. According to our Constitution, the President replaces vacant seats on the Supreme Court. That duty does not end, as I noted, in a Presidential year, just as the responsibilities of all Senators in their States and in their Nation do not end in an election year. President Obama was elected to serve out his entire second term, not just the first 3 years. For 332 long days, the President will be the democratically elected President of the United States--democratically elected, as in a democracy, as in how our democracy functions. He has an obligation to all Americans to dutifully execute his oath of office. The President has not yet announced a nominee to fill the current vacancy on the Court. When he does, it will be the constitutional duty of each one of us to consider the nominee on his or her merits and then choose whether to vote yes or no. It is really not that hard. It is what the kids learn when they are taught social studies and civics when they are in elementary school. The American people who voted for us, as well as those who didn't vote for us, expect us to do the jobs we were elected to do, regardless of the timing. A complete refusal to engage in this constitutionally required process before the President has even announced a nominee is dangerous for our system of governance. It defies the words of the Constitution. This Chamber would be neglecting a key constitutional duty if it prevented a well-qualified nominee from serving on the Supreme Court. And guess what. How do we figure out if someone is well qualified? We have hearings. That is what we have been doing for decades now. We have hearings to figure out whether this person is qualified. That is how we advise. That is how we consent. That is how we do our duty under the Constitution. It is for that reason that I urge my colleagues to continue in the Senate's bipartisan tradition of giving full and fair consideration to Supreme Court nominees. We have precedent for the Senate performing this role in the final year of a Presidency. Most recently, [[Page S942]] the Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy, someone who is currently serving on the Supreme Court, a current member sitting on the Supreme Court, someone who makes decisions every day. When was he confirmed? He was confirmed in the last year of Ronald Reagan's Presidency. And guess what. The Senate was controlled by Democrats. So we had the exact opposite situation. Now we have a Democratic President and we have a Senate that is in the control of Republicans. Back then we had a Republican President and a Senate that was in the control of Democrats. People say: Well, what does history show us? What do we know? To me, that is the best example of history. And we know what happened: Justice Kennedy was confirmed, on Ronald Reagan's nomination, by a Democratic Senate in an election year unanimously--unanimously. The Senate has taken such action more than a dozen times in our Nation's history, and there is no reason to abandon that precedent now. I am talking about when a Justice position opens up during an election year. We have that precedent, which I think is important. Again, I think the most important precedent, the most important example for historians, is what I led with: the fact that we have to go back to the Civil War to find a time when we left a vacancy on the Supreme Court open for a year. Think about that. Through World War I, through World War II, through huge tumult in this country, we always made sure we had a fully staffed Supreme Court. It would be unprecedented to deny a Supreme Court nominee fair consideration in the U.S. Senate. In the last 100 years, the Senate has taken action on every Supreme Court nominee regardless of whether the nomination was made in a Presidential year. It is now February, which gives us plenty of time to consider and confirm a nominee. Let's go to that next. People say: When will we have the time to get that done? I would submit that we do. We have hundreds of days before us. In fact, the Senate has taken an average of only 67 days. Let's make it easier: 2 months--about 2 months. That is the average since 1975 from the date of the nomination to the confirmation vote--2 months. That means that if the President offers a nomination, say, in the month of March--that sounds like a good month to have a nominee--that nominee would receive a vote in the Senate by Memorial Day. There are our 2 months. And if we even wanted to add a little time on, we would certainly do it by the Fourth of July, which is a very good holiday for those who believe in the Constitution and in the words of the Constitution. Until we confirm a nominee, the Court is left with only eight Justices. A split decision will prevent the Supreme Court from making critical decisions and leave lower courts without a precedent to follow. A major responsibility of the Supreme Court is to resolve disagreements among lower courts. A failure of the President or the Senate to meet its constitutional obligations would cause the Supreme Court to be unable to fill its constitutional obligations. These Supreme Court Justices aren't elected directly; they have lifetime appointments. Their job is to be insulated from elections and politics, and that is why we have these strict and straightforward words in the Constitution that say that the President shall nominate someone for the job, and they also say that the Senate will advise and consent. We have those words in place in the Constitution, in that incredibly important document that guides us in this Chamber every single day, just for a situation such as this one, just for situations such as these. In closing, I remind my colleagues of the important work the people have sent us here to do. Yes, we have major disputes every day. That happens every day. We get into arguments about issues. There are political campaigns going on. But we have always at least followed the Constitution. That is what this is about today. As soon as we have a nominee, as soon as the President exercises his constitutional duty and puts someone in place, we should follow the Constitution and our longstanding traditions and the history of this country and uphold that duty. We should diligently consider the President's nominee to be the next Supreme Court Justice. As members of the Judiciary Committee, we must have the confirmation hearing. We must do our jobs. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am here to talk about Takata airbags, but I want to say to the Senator from Minnesota that she is so right on. The Constitution, article II, says that the President ``shall nominate'' and the Senate ``shall confirm.'' It doesn't say ``may'' or ``wish.'' It says ``shall.'' It is a constitutional responsibility of our duties. Just do your job, U.S. Senate. Just do the job, and we will see, once the President comes forward with a nominee. Let's see. Are we going to have committee hearings? Let's see if we are going to have open and bipartisan discussion on the merits of the nominee that is put forth. Let's see if the Constitution is trashed or whether the Constitution is upheld in the process put out to us in the third branch of government. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S939-S942] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came to the floor because I am stunned. I just learned that the Republicans have announced to the country they will not even call a hearing, if and when President Obama does his job and nominates a replacement for Justice Scalia. We send our heartfelt sympathy to his family. I don't know where the Republicans have come up with this notion that this is the right thing to do. If you look at the strict constitutionalists, you know they are reading the Constitution, unless they are phonies. This is what the Constitution says, the President shall ``nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court.'' Where in this does it say: except in election years. As a matter of fact, we have acted 14 times in election years. [[Page S940]] Whoever is a strict constructionist should read the Constitution, article II, section 2, clause 2. I am going to read it again: The President shall ``nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court.'' It doesn't say as Senator Cornyn said: Oh, the President can nominate, but nobody else has a job to do. Oh no. It says: ``. . . and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate . . .'' To have such a press conference, as I understand it--I didn't see it myself, but it has been reported to me--there has been an announcement that the Republicans will not even hold a hearing, which goes against this Constitution. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a lawsuit brought by the people of this country, 70 percent of whom believe we have an obligation. We have an obligation. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say it is too late for the President to nominate. Guess what. The Republicans keep saying we need an elected President. Well, I have good news for them. This President was elected twice and he has about a year left. Guess what. I am not going to run again, but I am here now. I want to work. I did not take this job to have a year off and not worry about working in my last year. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say: Oh, and by the way, don't advise and consent if it is a Democratic President in his second term. It does not say that. So if you consider yourself a strict constructionist, then pay attention to this. I am proud that several Republicans on the other side said: Baloney, we don't go along with it. Good for them and more should do it. It doesn't say in the Constitution, you only advise and consent if it is a Republican President with a Republican Senate. Again, the Senate over the years has repeatedly considered Supreme Court nominees in both election years and in the final year of a President's term. Justice Kennedy, who serves now, a fellow Californian, was nominated by President Reagan in 1987. I was over on the House side, and I didn't have anything to do with it, but I sure watched it. Kennedy was confirmed by a Democratic Senate during Reagan's last year in office. My Republican friends say: Oh, but this Senator said this about it and that Senator said that and Joe Biden said this. It doesn't matter what people say. It is what we do, and 14 times in history we have voted on judges in an election year. My Republican colleagues who suggest that this process cannot be done before President Obama leaves office are fooling themselves. History has disproven them and the Constitution is going to chastise whoever says: I want a dead Constitution. Read this. This is very clear. It absolutely is. So I have a message for my Republican friends. Pretty simple. Pretty simple. Do your job. Do your job. If you are afraid to do your job, then do something else with your life. If you don't want to do your job because you are worried that one moderate may get through, then make your argument. If you want to vote no, vote no, but to hold a press conference and say you will not even hold a hearing is outrageous. Every day in talented cities across this country, Americans show up for work and they do their jobs. They don't call their bosses and say: You know, I just don't feel like doing this today. I am healthy, I am fine, I am well, but you know what, I don't want to do my job. They would be fired and they should be. Do your job. You are elected to do your job. The American people show up for their jobs. They do their jobs. It is as simple as that. The Justices of the Supreme Court show up and they do their jobs every day. Justice Scalia did it. They all do it. They hear cases. They write opinions. The Supreme Court is the last stop on the justice train, but to be able to function as our Founding Fathers in the U.S. Constitution intended, they need a full bench with all nine Justices. A Supreme Court with eight Justices is not a functioning Court. Let us look at the Republicans' hero, Ronald Reagan. We always hear them say: Ronald Reagan. I was proud to serve in the House during Ronald Reagan's term. I didn't agree with him on a lot of things, but I agree with him on this. Do you know what he said? I look forward to prompt hearings conducted in the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship. I will do everything in my power as President to assist in that process. President Ronald Reagan, November 12, 1987. What did he say? Did he get up and say: Oh, it is an election year--which it was. No. Kennedy was voted on in an election year and President Reagan made the case. This is what else Ronald Reagan said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' Let me say that again. Ronald Reagan, who was pushing for a vote on a Supreme Court Justice in an election year, said the following: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' I don't understand where the Republicans are coming from. They are disregarding Ronald Reagan, their hero. They are disregarding the Constitution that they say is their shining star of their being, which it should be for all of us, and they stood there today and blatantly announced they are not even going to hold a hearing on a nominee before they even know who he or she is. What is that about? I am truly stunned. I thought I had seen everything, but I have never seen this. You show up and you do your job. I am going to show you a few other quotes of people who are very important to this conversation and what they are saying about not moving forward. How about Sandra Day O'Connor, what an incredible woman. She was appointed by Ronald Reagan, the first female ever appointed to the Supreme Court, a magnificent person and a Republican. What did she say? ``I think we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' She just said that 10 days ago or less. Is she a partisan? I don't think so. She is speaking from the heart. She is speaking from her soul. She is speaking from experience. She knows the Court has important cases before it and will be tied in knots if we don't have a Court at full strength. Again, here is what she said, Republican Sandra Day O'Connor, esteemed member of the Supreme Court, a Ronald Reagan nominee: ``I think we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' I am going to show you two more quotes. This is from the American Constitution Society: A vacancy on the Court for a year and a half, which is what the Republicans want, at least a year and a half, would mean many instances where the Court could not resolve a split among the circuits. There would be the very undesirable result that the same federal law would have differing meanings in various parts of the country. That is the American Constitution Society. Then we have another quote I wish to share with you by the director of the Byron White Center at the University of Colorado: It would essentially shut the Supreme Court down for two years. It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve large legal questions. Let me say it again. It would essentially shut the Supreme Court down for two years. It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve large legal questions. It is not as if large legal questions aren't at stake. Right now the Supreme Court is set to look at some incredibly important cases that have real effects on our people. This isn't some argument in a salon. This is real stuff. The cases can't wait, and it doesn't matter what side you are on with these cases. They have to be resolved. What about voting rights? I don't think there would be a difference of opinion in this Chamber that this is what makes this country great and special, the right to vote, the responsibility to vote. We have many States that have put forward voter ID laws. They need to be told whether they are fair or unfair, whatever side you come down on. We need a Court to look at voting rights cases and see who the eligible voters are. Affirmative action. They are going to reexamine that case. Whatever side you are on, it has to be decided. [[Page S941]] Workers' rights. The Court will decide the impact of the ability of the union to represent millions of working Americans. Whatever side you are on, there needs to be a decision, otherwise you are going to have different States with different laws and it makes no sense. This is one Nation under God. That is why we have a U.S. Senate and a U.S. House and a U.S. President and a U.S. Supreme Court--because we are one Nation and these issues have to be decided. There is one on employee discrimination. How do people get their day in court if they are being discriminated against? It doesn't matter what side you are on. The fact is there needs to be a decision. Women's health. There is a big case on women's health as to whether workers can get birth control. Again, whatever side you are on, pro, con, there needs to be a decision. It is about women, health care, voting rights, students. These cases have real consequences. I am going to conclude with one more chart that deals with the length of Supreme Court Justices for the past 35 years. Here you see the list of the various nominees. Not all of these made it, a couple did not, but here is the deal with these. O'Connor waited 95 days, Rehnquist 92, Scalia 82, Bork 109, Kennedy 113, Souter 74, Thomas 110, Ginsburg 137, Breyer 114, Roberts 90, Alito 95, Sotomayor 97, Kagan 118. Under Mitch McConnell's plan, the Republican plan that they laid out, if you averaged all of this, you get 102 days. That is the average it takes. Under McConnell's plan, it would take 444 days, at best. That is assuming everything goes perfectly well. It could take a lot longer. What does this mean? Anyone within the sound of my voice has heard this: Justice delayed is justice denied. That is a fact. And it is used throughout the country when we talk about the importance of making these decisions. When our constituents go to jury duty, what are they asked? Can you make this decision? Can you come to this decision? Because everyone deserves to have an answer. So, in conclusion, take a look at this. This is an abomination. This is the number of days we have seen over the last 35 years that it took to confirm. Fourteen of our Justices have been confirmed in election years since the beginning of this country, and this takes us back to the Civil War days--imagine--when we really had a country divided. This is not what we need to do right now, with all of these decisions coming up. Regardless of your stand on them, people deserve justice. I will conclude with the ``Do Your Job'' chart because I have to say that is what it comes down to. I urge the people of this great country to call the Republicans, every one of them, with three words: Do your job. And if the person who answers says ``I don't know what you mean,'' say ``Do your job. Let the process move forward on the Supreme Court Justice.'' And if they say ``Well, we want an elected President,'' what will be told to them is ``We are fortunate. We have one, elected not once but twice.'' More than enough time remains for him to do his job, and more than enough time remains for us to do ours. Republicans, do your job. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance of filling the current vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. I appreciate the words of my colleague from California. I wish to begin by saying that my prayers and thoughts are with the family and friends and Supreme Court colleagues of Justice Scalia. He was a great scholar who had friends in many places. Just last week I was at the University of Chicago Law School, where I went to law school, and so many people have stories. He used to teach there. He taught there for a long period of time, and they miss him very much. The Supreme Court has the constitutional responsibility to weigh some of the most important issues facing the American people. From freedom of speech, to due process, to doing business in America, Supreme Court decisions have impacted and continue to impact the daily life of every citizen of this country. As one of the three pillars of our government, we value the Court's distinctive insulation from public opinion. Justices commit themselves to the law and to the Constitution and not to politics or partisanship. Americans need and deserve to have a functional and fully staffed Supreme Court. We cannot delay consideration of the next Supreme Court nominee. As my colleague just pointed out, we would have to go back to the Civil War, to a time where a position--an important key position on the Supreme Court of the United States--was left open. We would have to go back to a time when it was left open for more than a year. We would have to go back to a time before we had planes, before we had automobiles, before we had washing machines--you name it. We would have to go back to the Civil War. Delaying the confirmation of a new Justice will prevent the Court from issuing binding precedent and deny access to justice for Americans. Lower courts will be left with decisions, and decisions will not be made in those cases. That is why the Constitution of the United States says that the President shall--shall--nominate someone to the Supreme Court. It doesn't say that he will wait for a year. It doesn't say that he can't do it in an election year. It says that he shall nominate someone. We have a lot of Members of this great body who are lawyers, a lot of whom I have heard quoting the Constitution. A lot of them believe in strict interpretation of the words of the Constitution. Well, the words of the Constitution say that the President ``shall nominate'' and that the Senate's job is to ``advise and consent.'' It says that it is the Senate's job. It doesn't say that it is the Senate's job to avoid things and to just go on TV and to run ads. No. It says that the Senate has a job to do. The Senate has a job to do. Both the President and the Senate have a constitutional duty to protect the Supreme Court's ability to function and dispense justice-- not to tell the Supreme Court what to do, not to dictate their decisions, but to make sure they are simply able to do justice. This means they must be fully staffed and have the Justices in place, and it also means they should be funded. Those are our jobs. According to our Constitution, the President replaces vacant seats on the Supreme Court. That duty does not end, as I noted, in a Presidential year, just as the responsibilities of all Senators in their States and in their Nation do not end in an election year. President Obama was elected to serve out his entire second term, not just the first 3 years. For 332 long days, the President will be the democratically elected President of the United States--democratically elected, as in a democracy, as in how our democracy functions. He has an obligation to all Americans to dutifully execute his oath of office. The President has not yet announced a nominee to fill the current vacancy on the Court. When he does, it will be the constitutional duty of each one of us to consider the nominee on his or her merits and then choose whether to vote yes or no. It is really not that hard. It is what the kids learn when they are taught social studies and civics when they are in elementary school. The American people who voted for us, as well as those who didn't vote for us, expect us to do the jobs we were elected to do, regardless of the timing. A complete refusal to engage in this constitutionally required process before the President has even announced a nominee is dangerous for our system of governance. It defies the words of the Constitution. This Chamber would be neglecting a key constitutional duty if it prevented a well-qualified nominee from serving on the Supreme Court. And guess what.

That is how we advise. That is how we consent. That is how we do our duty under the Constitution. It is for that reason that I urge my colleagues to continue in the Senate's bipartisan tradition of giving full and fair consideration to Supreme Court nominees. We have precedent for the Senate performing this role in the final year of a Presidency. Most recently, [[Page S942]] the Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy, someone who is currently serving on the Supreme Court, a current member sitting on the Supreme Court, someone who makes decisions every day. When was he confirmed? He was confirmed in the last year of Ronald Reagan's Presidency. And guess what. The Senate was controlled by Democrats. So we had the exact opposite situation. Now we have a Democratic President and we have a Senate that is in the control of Republicans. Back then we had a Republican President and a Senate that was in the control of Democrats.

I was proud to serve in the House during Ronald Reagan's term. I didn't agree with him on a lot of things, but I agree with him on this. Do you know what he said? I look forward to prompt hearings conducted in the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship. I will do everything in my power as President to assist in that process. President Ronald Reagan, November 12, 1987. What did he say? Did he get up and say: Oh, it is an election year--which it was. No. Kennedy was voted on in an election year and President Reagan made the case. This is what else Ronald Reagan said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' Let me say that again. Ronald Reagan, who was pushing for a vote on a Supreme Court Justice in an election year, said the following: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' I don't understand where the Republicans are coming from. They are disregarding Ronald Reagan, their hero. They are disregarding the Constitution that they say is their shining star of their being, which it should be for all of us, and they stood there today and blatantly announced they are not even going to hold a hearing on a nominee before they even know who he or she is. What is that about? I am truly stunned. I thought I had seen everything, but I have never seen this. You show up and you do your job. I am going to show you a few other quotes of people who are very important to this conversation and what they are saying about not moving forward. How about Sandra Day O'Connor, what an incredible woman. She was appointed by Ronald Reagan, the first female ever appointed to the Supreme Court, a magnificent person and a Republican. What did she say? ``I think we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' She just said that 10 days ago or less. Is she a partisan? I don't think so. She is speaking from the heart. She is speaking from her soul. She is speaking from experience. She knows the Court has important cases before it and will be tied in knots if we don't have a Court at full strength. Again, here is what she said, Republican Sandra Day O'Connor, esteemed member of the Supreme Court, a Ronald Reagan nominee: ``I think we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' I am going to show you two more quotes. This is from the American Constitution Society: A vacancy on the Court for a year and a half, which is what the Republicans want, at least a year and a half, would mean many instances where the Court could not resolve a split among the circuits. There would be the very undesirable result that the same federal law would have differing meanings in various parts of the country. That is the American Constitution Society. Then we have another quote I wish to share with you by the director of the Byron White Center at the University of Colorado: It would essentially shut the Supreme Court down for two years. It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve large legal questions. Let me say it again. It would essentially shut the Supreme Court down for two years. It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve large legal questions. It is not as if large legal questions aren't at stake. Right now the Supreme Court is set to look at some incredibly important cases that have real effects on our people. This isn't some argument in a salon. This is real stuff. The cases can't wait, and it doesn't matter what side you are on with these cases. They have to be resolved. What about voting rights? I don't think there would be a difference of opinion in this Chamber that this is what makes this country great and special, the right to vote, the responsibility to vote. We have many States that have put forward voter ID laws. They need to be told whether they are fair or unfair, whatever side you come down on. We need a Court to look at voting rights cases and see who the eligible voters are. Affirmative action. They are going to reexamine that case. Whatever side you are on, it has to be decided. [[Page S941]] Workers' rights. The Court will decide the impact of the ability of the union to represent millions of working Americans. Whatever side you are on, there needs to be a decision, otherwise you are going to have different States with different laws and it makes no sense. This is one Nation under God. That is why we have a U.S. Senate and a U.S. House and a U.S. President and a U.S. Supreme Court--because we are one Nation and these issues have to be decided. There is one on employee discrimination. How do people get their day in court if they are being discriminated against? It doesn't matter what side you are on. The fact is there needs to be a decision. Women's health. There is a big case on women's health as to whether workers can get birth control. Again, whatever side you are on, pro, con, there needs to be a decision. It is about women, health care, voting rights, students. These cases have real consequences. I am going to conclude with one more chart that deals with the length of Supreme Court Justices for the past 35 years. Here you see the list of the various nominees. Not all of these made it, a couple did not, but here is the deal with these. O'Connor waited 95 days, Rehnquist 92, Scalia 82, Bork 109, Kennedy 113, Souter 74, Thomas 110, Ginsburg 137, Breyer 114, Roberts 90, Alito 95, Sotomayor 97, Kagan 118. Under Mitch McConnell's plan, the Republican plan that they laid out, if you averaged all of this, you get 102 days. That is the average it takes. Under McConnell's plan, it would take 444 days, at best. That is assuming everything goes perfectly well. It could take a lot longer. What does this mean? Anyone within the sound of my voice has heard this: Justice delayed is justice denied. That is a fact. And it is used throughout the country when we talk about the importance of making these decisions. When our constituents go to jury duty, what are they asked? Can you make this decision? Can you come to this decision? Because everyone deserves to have an answer. So, in conclusion, take a look at this. This is an abomination. This is the number of days we have seen over the last 35 years that it took to confirm. Fourteen of our Justices have been confirmed in election years since the beginning of this country, and this takes us back to the Civil War days--imagine--when we really had a country divided. This is not what we need to do right now, with all of these decisions coming up. Regardless of your stand on them, people deserve justice. I will conclude with the ``Do Your Job'' chart because I have to say that is what it comes down to. I urge the people of this great country to call the Republicans, every one of them, with three words: Do your job. And if the person who answers says ``I don't know what you mean,'' say ``Do your job. Let the process move forward on the Supreme Court Justice.'' And if they say ``Well, we want an elected President,'' what will be told to them is ``We are fortunate. We have one, elected not once but twice.'' More than enough time remains for him to do his job, and more than enough time remains for us to do ours. Republicans, do your job. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance of filling the current vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. I appreciate the words of my colleague from California. I wish to begin by saying that my prayers and thoughts are with the family and friends and Supreme Court colleagues of Justice Scalia. He was a great scholar who had friends in many places. Just last week I was at the University of Chicago Law School, where I went to law school, and so many people have stories. He used to teach there. He taught there for a long period of time, and they miss him very much. The Supreme Court has the constitutional responsibility to weigh some of the most important issues facing the American people. From freedom of speech, to due process, to doing business in America, Supreme Court decisions have impacted and continue to impact the daily life of every citizen of this country. As one of the three pillars of our government, we value the Court's distinctive insulation from public opinion. Justices commit themselves to the law and to the Constitution and not to politics or partisanship. Americans need and deserve to have a functional and fully staffed Supreme Court. We cannot delay consideration of the next Supreme Court nominee. As my colleague just pointed out, we would have to go back to the Civil War, to a time where a position--an important key position on the Supreme Court of the United States--was left open. We would have to go back to a time when it was left open for more than a year. We would have to go back to a time before we had planes, before we had automobiles, before we had washing machines--you name it. We would have to go back to the Civil War. Delaying the confirmation of a new Justice will prevent the Court from issuing binding precedent and deny access to justice for Americans. Lower courts will be left with decisions, and decisions will not be made in those cases. That is why the Constitution of the United States says that the President shall--shall--nominate someone to the Supreme Court. It doesn't say that he will wait for a year. It doesn't say that he can't do it in an election year. It says that he shall nominate someone. We have a lot of Members of this great body who are lawyers, a lot of whom I have heard quoting the Constitution. A lot of them believe in strict interpretation of the words of the Constitution. Well, the words of the Constitution say that the President ``shall nominate'' and that the Senate's job is to ``advise and consent.'' It says that it is the Senate's job. It doesn't say that it is the Senate's job to avoid things and to just go on TV and to run ads. No. It says that the Senate has a job to do. The Senate has a job to do. Both the President and the Senate have a constitutional duty to protect the Supreme Court's ability to function and dispense justice-- not to tell the Supreme Court what to do, not to dictate their decisions, but to make sure they are simply able to do justice. This means they must be fully staffed and have the Justices in place, and it also means they should be funded. Those are our jobs. According to our Constitution, the President replaces vacant seats on the Supreme Court. That duty does not end, as I noted, in a Presidential year, just as the responsibilities of all Senators in their States and in their Nation do not end in an election year. President Obama was elected to serve out his entire second term, not just the first 3 years. For 332 long days, the President will be the democratically elected President of the United States--democratically elected, as in a democracy, as in how our democracy functions. He has an obligation to all Americans to dutifully execute his oath of office. The President has not yet announced a nominee to fill the current vacancy on the Court. When he does, it will be the constitutional duty of each one of us to consider the nominee on his or her merits and then choose whether to vote yes or no. It is really not that hard. It is what the kids learn when they are taught social studies and civics when they are in elementary school. The American people who voted for us, as well as those who didn't vote for us, expect us to do the jobs we were elected to do, regardless of the timing. A complete refusal to engage in this constitutionally required process before the President has even announced a nominee is dangerous for our system of governance. It defies the words of the Constitution. This Chamber would be neglecting a key constitutional duty if it prevented a well-qualified nominee from serving on the Supreme Court. And guess what. How do we figure out if someone is well qualified? We have hearings. That is what we have been doing for decades now. We have hearings to figure out whether this person is qualified. That is how we advise. That is how we consent. That is how we do our duty under the Constitution. It is for that reason that I urge my colleagues to continue in the Senate's bipartisan tradition of giving full and fair consideration to Supreme Court nominees. We have precedent for the Senate performing this role in the final year of a Presidency. Most recently, [[Page S942]] the Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy, someone who is currently serving on the Supreme Court, a current member sitting on the Supreme Court, someone who makes decisions every day. When was he confirmed? He was confirmed in the last year of Ronald Reagan's Presidency. And guess what. The Senate was controlled by Democrats. So we had the exact opposite situation. Now we have a Democratic President and we have a Senate that is in the control of Republicans. Back then we had a Republican President and a Senate that was in the control of Democrats. People say: Well, what does history show us? What do we know? To me, that is the best example of history. And we know what happened: Justice Kennedy was confirmed, on Ronald Reagan's nomination, by a Democratic Senate in an election year unanimously--unanimously. The Senate has taken such action more than a dozen times in our Nation's history, and there is no reason to abandon that precedent now. I am talking about when a Justice position opens up during an election year. We have that precedent, which I think is important. Again, I think the most important precedent, the most important example for historians, is what I led with: the fact that we have to go back to the Civil War to find a time when we left a vacancy on the Supreme Court open for a year. Think about that. Through World War I, through World War II, through huge tumult in this country, we always made sure we had a fully staffed Supreme Court. It would be unprecedented to deny a Supreme Court nominee fair consideration in the U.S. Senate. In the last 100 years, the Senate has taken action on every Supreme Court nominee regardless of whether the nomination was made in a Presidential year. It is now February, which gives us plenty of time to consider and confirm a nominee. Let's go to that next. People say: When will we have the time to get that done? I would submit that we do. We have hundreds of days before us. In fact, the Senate has taken an average of only 67 days. Let's make it easier: 2 months--about 2 months. That is the average since 1975 from the date of the nomination to the confirmation vote--2 months. That means that if the President offers a nomination, say, in the month of March--that sounds like a good month to have a nominee--that nominee would receive a vote in the Senate by Memorial Day. There are our 2 months. And if we even wanted to add a little time on, we would certainly do it by the Fourth of July, which is a very good holiday for those who believe in the Constitution and in the words of the Constitution. Until we confirm a nominee, the Court is left with only eight Justices. A split decision will prevent the Supreme Court from making critical decisions and leave lower courts without a precedent to follow. A major responsibility of the Supreme Court is to resolve disagreements among lower courts. A failure of the President or the Senate to meet its constitutional obligations would cause the Supreme Court to be unable to fill its constitutional obligations. These Supreme Court Justices aren't elected directly; they have lifetime appointments. Their job is to be insulated from elections and politics, and that is why we have these strict and straightforward words in the Constitution that say that the President shall nominate someone for the job, and they also say that the Senate will advise and consent. We have those words in place in the Constitution, in that incredibly important document that guides us in this Chamber every single day, just for a situation such as this one, just for situations such as these. In closing, I remind my colleagues of the important work the people have sent us here to do. Yes, we have major disputes every day. That happens every day. We get into arguments about issues. There are political campaigns going on. But we have always at least followed the Constitution. That is what this is about today. As soon as we have a nominee, as soon as the President exercises his constitutional duty and puts someone in place, we should follow the Constitution and our longstanding traditions and the history of this country and uphold that duty. We should diligently consider the President's nominee to be the next Supreme Court Justice. As members of the Judiciary Committee, we must have the confirmation hearing. We must do our jobs. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am here to talk about Takata airbags, but I want to say to the Senator from Minnesota that she is so right on. The Constitution, article II, says that the President ``shall nominate'' and the Senate ``shall confirm.'' It doesn't say ``may'' or ``wish.'' It says ``shall.'' It is a constitutional responsibility of our duties. Just do your job, U.S. Senate. Just do the job, and we will see, once the President comes forward with a nominee. Let's see. Are we going to have committee hearings? Let's see if we are going to have open and bipartisan discussion on the merits of the nominee that is put forth. Let's see if the Constitution is trashed or whether the Constitution is upheld in the process put out to us in the third branch of government. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.",package_114_144.csv,23111,23111,23182,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [senate] [pages s939-s942] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] filling the supreme court vacancy mrs. boxer. mr. president, i came to the floor because i am stunned. i just learned that the republicans have announced to the country they will not even call a hearing, if and when president obama does his job and nominates a replacement for justice scalia. we send our heartfelt sympathy to his family. i don't know where the republicans have come up with this notion that this is the right thing to do. if you look at the strict constitutionalists, you know they are reading the constitution, unless they are phonies. this is what the constitution says, the president shall ``nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme court.'' where in this does it say: except in election years. as a matter of fact, we have acted 14 times in election years. [[page s940]] whoever is a strict constructionist should read the constitution, article ii, section 2, clause 2. i am going to read it again: the president shall ``nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme court.'' it doesn't say as senator cornyn said: oh, the president can nominate, but nobody else has a job to do. oh no. it says: ``. . . and with the advice and consent of the senate . . .'' to have such a press conference, as i understand it--i didn't see it myself, but it has been reported to me--there has been an announcement that the republicans will not even hold a hearing, which goes against this constitution. i wouldn't be surprised if there is a lawsuit brought by the people of this country, 70 percent of whom believe we have an obligation. we have an obligation. nowhere in the constitution does it say it is too late for the president to nominate. guess what. the republicans keep saying we need an elected president. well, i have good news for them. this president was elected twice and he has about a year left. guess what. i am not going to run again, but i am here now. i want to work. i did not take this job to have a year off and not worry about working in my last year. nowhere in the constitution does it say: oh, and by the way, don't advise and consent if it is a democratic president in his second term. it does not say that. so if you consider yourself a strict constructionist, then pay attention to this. i am proud that several republicans on the other side said: baloney, we don't go along with it. good for them and more should do it. it doesn't say in the constitution, you only advise and consent if it is a republican president with a republican senate. again, the senate over the years has repeatedly considered supreme court nominees in both election years and in the final year of a president's term. justice kennedy, who serves now, a fellow californian, was nominated by president reagan in 1987. i was over on the house side, and i didn't have anything to do with it, but i sure watched it. kennedy was confirmed by a democratic senate during reagan's last year in office. my republican friends say: oh, but this senator said this about it and that senator said that and joe biden said this. it doesn't matter what people say. it is what we do, and 14 times in history we have voted on judges in an election year. my republican colleagues who suggest that this process cannot be done before president obama leaves office are fooling themselves. history has disproven them and the constitution is going to chastise whoever says: i want a dead constitution. read this. this is very clear. it absolutely is. so i have a message for my republican friends. pretty simple. pretty simple. do your job. do your job. if you are afraid to do your job, then do something else with your life. if you don't want to do your job because you are worried that one moderate may get through, then make your argument. if you want to vote no, vote no, but to hold a press conference and say you will not even hold a hearing is outrageous. every day in talented cities across this country, americans show up for work and they do their jobs. they don't call their bosses and say: you know, i just don't feel like doing this today. i am healthy, i am fine, i am well, but you know what, i don't want to do my job. they would be fired and they should be. do your job. you are elected to do your job. the american people show up for their jobs. they do their jobs. it is as simple as that. the justices of the supreme court show up and they do their jobs every day. justice scalia did it. they all do it. they hear cases. they write opinions. the supreme court is the last stop on the justice train, but to be able to function as our founding fathers in the u.s. constitution intended, they need a full bench with all nine justices. a supreme court with eight justices is not a functioning court. let us look at the republicans' hero, ronald reagan. we always hear them say: ronald reagan. i was proud to serve in the house during ronald reagan's term. i didn't agree with him on a lot of things, but i agree with him on this. do you know what he said? i look forward to prompt hearings conducted in the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship. i will do everything in my power as president to assist in that process. president ronald reagan, november 12, 1987. what did he say? did he get up and say: oh, it is an election year--which it was. no. kennedy was voted on in an election year and president reagan made the case. this is what else ronald reagan said: ``every day that passes with a supreme court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' let me say that again. ronald reagan, who was pushing for a vote on a supreme court justice in an election year, said the following: ``every day that passes with a supreme court below full strength impairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' i don't understand where the republicans are coming from. they are disregarding ronald reagan, their hero. they are disregarding the constitution that they say is their shining star of their being, which it should be for all of us, and they stood there today and blatantly announced they are not even going to hold a hearing on a nominee before they even know who he or she is. what is that about?

refusal to engage in this constitutionally required process before the president has even announced a nominee is dangerous for our system of governance. it defies the words of the constitution. this chamber would be neglecting a key constitutional duty if it prevented a well-qualified nominee from serving on the supreme court. and guess what. how do we figure out if someone is well qualified? we have hearings. that is what we have been doing for decades now. we have hearings to figure out whether this person is qualified. that is how we advise. that is how we consent. that is how we do our duty under the constitution. it is for that reason that i urge my colleagues to continue in the senate's bipartisan tradition of giving full and fair consideration to supreme court nominees. we have precedent for the senate performing this role in the final year of a presidency. most recently, [[page s942]] the senate confirmed justice kennedy, someone who is currently serving on the supreme court, a current member sitting on the supreme court, someone who makes decisions every day. when was he confirmed? he was confirmed in the last year of ronald reagan's presidency. and guess what. the senate was controlled by democrats. so we had the exact opposite situation. now we have a democratic president and we have a senate that is in the control of republicans. back then we had a republican president and a senate that was in the control of democrats. people say: well, what does history show us? what do we know? to me, that is the best example of history. and we know what happened: justice kennedy was confirmed, on ronald reagan's nomination, by a democratic senate in an election year unanimously--unanimously. the senate has taken such action more than a dozen times in our nation's history, and there is no reason to abandon that precedent now. i am talking about when a justice position opens up during an election year. we have that precedent, which i think is important. again, i think the most important precedent, the most important example for historians, is what i led with: the fact that we have to go back to the civil war to find a time when we left a vacancy on the supreme court open for a year. think about that. through world war i, through world war ii, through huge tumult in this country, we always made sure we had a fully staffed supreme court. it would be unprecedented to deny a supreme court nominee fair consideration in the u.s. senate. in the last 100 years, the senate has taken action on every supreme court nominee regardless of whether the nomination was made in a presidential year. it is now february, which gives us plenty of time to consider and confirm a nominee. let's go to that next. people say: when will we have the time to get that done? i would submit that we do. we have hundreds of days before us. in fact, the senate has taken an average of only 67 days. let's make it easier: 2 months--about 2 months. that is the average since 1975 from the date of the nomination to the confirmation vote--2 months. that means that if the president offers a nomination, say, in the month of march--that sounds like a good month to have a nominee--that nominee would receive a vote in the senate by memorial day. there are our 2 months. and if we even wanted to add a little time on, we would certainly do it by the fourth of july, which is a very good holiday for those who believe in the constitution and in the words of the constitution. until we confirm a nominee, the court is left with only eight justices. a split decision will prevent the supreme court from making critical decisions and leave lower courts without a precedent to follow. a major responsibility of the supreme court is to resolve disagreements among lower courts. a failure of the president or the senate to meet its constitutional obligations would cause the supreme court to be unable to fill its constitutional obligations. these supreme court justices aren't elected directly; they have lifetime appointments. their job is to be insulated from elections and politics, and that is why we have these strict and straightforward words in the constitution that say that the president shall nominate someone for the job, and they also say that the senate will advise and consent. we have those words in place in the constitution, in that incredibly important document that guides us in this chamber every single day, just for a situation such as this one, just for situations such as these. in closing, i remind my colleagues of the important work the people have sent us here to do. yes, we have major disputes every day. that happens every day. we get into arguments about issues. there are political campaigns going on. but we have always at least followed the constitution. that is what this is about today. as soon as we have a nominee, as soon as the president exercises his constitutional duty and puts someone in place, we should follow the constitution and our longstanding traditions and the history of this country and uphold that duty. we should diligently consider the president's nominee to be the next supreme court justice. as members of the judiciary committee, we must have the confirmation hearing. we must do our jobs. thank you, mr. president, and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from florida. mr. nelson. mr. president, i am here to talk about takata airbags, but i want to say to the senator from minnesota that she is so right on. the constitution, article ii, says that the president ``shall nominate'' and the senate ``shall confirm.'' it doesn't say ``may'' or ``wish.'' it says ``shall.'' it is a constitutional responsibility of our duties. just do your job, u.s. senate. just do the job, and we will see, once the president comes forward with a nominee. let's see. are we going to have committee hearings? let's see if we are going to have open and bipartisan discussion on the merits of the nominee that is put forth. let's see if the constitution is trashed or whether the constitution is upheld in the process put out to us in the third branch of government. i thank the senator from minnesota.",23111
CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS942,CREC-2016-02-23,114,Takata Airbags (Executive Calendar),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S942-S943] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Takata Airbags Mr. President, I came here to speak about something else--something that looks very sinister. As a matter of fact, I ask unanimous consent to have two items to show to the Senate with regard to the Takata airbag crisis. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. It looks kind of sinister, unfortunately, because it is. It is supposed to save lives, not kill. This is an airbag. It obviously has already been inflated. It goes right in the steering wheel, so when you get in an accident, this inflates and fills up with gas within a split second, and that protects your head and your torso from coming forward and being injured. What happens if this malfunctions, and what happens if the very manufacture of it causes it to malfunction under conditions? Let me show you what happens. I said these things look pretty sinister. Indeed, this is pretty sinister because this is a fragment that was in the metal casing in one of these airbags in Florida that, when it malfunctioned, caused the explosive force of the ammonium nitrate gas. It was so explosive that it ripped apart the metal casing, and this part that I am showing came flying into the face of the driver, severely injuring the driver. In this case it hit the forehead. I have told the Senate on many occasions that fragments of metal like this have come out just within the Orlando area of my State. They found a woman in the middle of an intersection where she had a collision, and when the police arrived, they found out that she was dead. She had bled to death. They looked at her neck and it was slashed. The police's immediate response was that this was a homicide. Upon reflection, she had a collision in the intersection that otherwise would have been a major fender bender, but because of a defective Takata airbag, it sent a piece of metal like this into her neck and cut her jugular vein. Near Orlando, a firefighter--a big, strapping, 6-foot-4 hunk of a man--doesn't have an eye anymore because a piece of metal fragment like this one from a Takata airbag came out when there was nothing more than a fender bender. When this bag exploded, it sent out a piece of metal. In his case, that firefighter doesn't have the sight in one eye because this piece of metal fragment hit him. Unfortunately, this has happened all over the country. Unfortunately, it has happened with a great deal of, shall we say, dragging of feet, coverup, and obfuscation. These airbags are supposed to save lives, but when they fail, they rupture violently and they send metal fragments right at the driver or the passenger. These Takata airbags have such an explosive force. What is behind it? Well, our staff on the Commerce Committee has just produced a report which this Senator is releasing today. It is an update on this report which found, through a review of recently obtained internal documents in the Takata Corporation, that Takata employees routinely manipulated safety testing data. That would be bad enough, but let's see the consequence of this drip, drip, drip approach to now a substantial number of recalls. There [[Page S943]] were a million vehicles recalled in 1 week, a million more the next, and there is no end in sight. A few days ago, there was a Reuters report that said that in addition to the already 20-plus million recalls of Takata airbags, an additional 70 to 90 million Takata airbags may have to be recalled right here in the United States. Can you imagine what that is going to do to all these poor auto dealers? I mean, don't even speak about the person who is in the greatest jeopardy, the one who is behind the wheel of a car with an explosive grenade right in front of their face, and the grenade may go off. But can you imagine the poor auto dealers, the Toyotas, the Hondas? Let me tell you about the last person killed. He was in a Ford F-150 pickup truck, and it was in South Carolina. By the time people got to the truck after the crash that would not have killed him, he was dead because of a fragment like this. I wish you could see this fragment. I wouldn't want that hitting me with an explosive force that inflates the airbag in less than 1 second. That is why the Commerce Committee has decided to jump all over this. We have been doing it for the last 2 years. We had a hearing on this 2 years ago. On the current recall, I said it was in excess of 20 million. It is actually 29 million with these defective inflators. That is because nine people are dead and dozens are injured. We find out now that in all, there may be 120 million airbags that eventually in the United Stated alone will have to be recalled. If you want a shocking figure, there may be in excess of 260 million airbags recalled worldwide. Knowing of all these problems, it is puzzling that the consent order that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration signed with Takata allows the continued production of ammonium nitrate-based inflators indefinitely. Then they said that certain ones had to be phased out by 2018. Why isn't the NHTSA taking a more aggressive approach? What is going on after all of these inflators, based on what we see with ammonium nitrate, have exploded? The essence of this and of the report we are releasing today as an addendum to the previous report is that the current recall may have to be redone. Why? Because auto manufacturers are installing new live grenades into people's cars as replacements for the old live grenades. According to Reuters and the New York Times, there are also internal documents that show Takata officials were aware of these consistent problems at its manufacturing plants. These reports claim that officials knew of manufacturing issues that could lead to moisture contamination, contaminating the ammonium nitrate wafer inside of the airbag inflator. This just adds all the more to the finding of evidence. Last June, the oversight and investigations staff of the Commerce Committee released a report on the Takata airbag fiasco showing that the company knew there were serious production and testing issues dating back more than one decade. That is why we wanted to release this report today. Through a thorough review of recently obtained internal documents at Takata, it was discovered that Takata employees continually manipulated the safety testing done. For example, in this report, in a 2005 memo to the Takata vice president, an engineer at Takata explained that ``the integrity of the validation reports . . . is in serious question.'' That engineer continued: ``These are not trivial changes in that the data clearly in violation of the customer specs is altered to meet the customer specs.'' The engineer called that ``a clear misrepresentation of the facts.'' That is what the Takata engineer said to one of the Takata vice presidents back in 2005. That was 11 years ago. In a 2006 email, a different engineering manager explained that testing reports were ``cherry picked'' and a Takata employee was ``schmoozed'' to accept deviations in the data. So was he schmoozed or intimidated? Whatever it was, it was altering what was the truth. The manager concluded--this is the Takata manager in 2006, which was 10 years ago--that ``the plant should have been screaming bloody murder long ago.'' Well, if I were a lawyer making a case to a jury, I would rest my case right now. The fact is, we are not lawyers arguing to a jury. As Senators, we are here to try to protect the American people. And this data manipulation has continued. Even after the recalls had been announced and the rupturing inflators had caused deaths and injuries, the data manipulation continued. I will give an example. A 2010 presentation explains that an experimental inflator was experiencing a significant safety and weld quality issue. According to that presentation, ``[Takata Japan] was informed of these results, but altered them and reported good results to Honda.'' Furthermore, even when these issues were raised to senior Takata employees, no action was taken. In a Takata director's notes from 2013, he explains that he shared his view that the range of a certain recall might be a ``violation of our moral obligation to protect the public.'' Let me repeat that. A ``violation of our moral obligation to protect the public''--that came from a Takata director. Wow. The engineer raised these concerns with Takata's senior vice president of quality assurance, but the vice president failed to take action to address it. These new documents that we note in this report from the committee speak for themselves. Takata failed to prioritize the safety of its products, and as a result, nine people are dead and dozens were injured. And even after exploding Takata airbags killed these innocent people, company employees continued to manipulate safety testing data. This is not only inexcusable, it is reprehensible. We have these thousands of automobile dealers around the country who have sold vehicles with the Takata airbags. They cannot sell a new vehicle if that vehicle is under recall because of a Takata airbag. Under law, they cannot sell that new vehicle. Also, rental car companies that have more than 15 cars cannot rent cars if they are under recall. But used car dealers can sell used cars that have a defective Takata airbags in them that is under recall--without fixing it. I really feel for our automobile dealers. I really feel for our automobile dealers also because what in the world are they going to do with the customers now screaming ``Replace this airbag'' when, in fact, there are not enough replacement airbags? In fact, because the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has allowed some of these replacements to go in with this ammonium nitrate, this is a horrendous situation. So I come to the floor today--this has been going on for over 2 years. We brought this out in a hearing in the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. And today I urge Takata and NHTSA to do what should have been done long ago: Stop producing these ammonium nitrate airbags and get them out of people's vehicles. And by the way, give your automobile dealers some relief. And how about giving the American driving public, which is driving around with one of these things in their face, some consideration and put them first? Hopefully, we will see some more action on this. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S942-S943] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Takata Airbags Mr. President, I came here to speak about something else--something that looks very sinister.

And this data manipulation has continued. Even after the recalls had been announced and the rupturing inflators had caused deaths and injuries, the data manipulation continued. I will give an example. A 2010 presentation explains that an experimental inflator was experiencing a significant safety and weld quality issue. According to that presentation, ``[Takata Japan] was informed of these results, but altered them and reported good results to Honda.'' Furthermore, even when these issues were raised to senior Takata employees, no action was taken. In a Takata director's notes from 2013, he explains that he shared his view that the range of a certain recall might be a ``violation of our moral obligation to protect the public.'' Let me repeat that. A ``violation of our moral obligation to protect the public''--that came from a Takata director. Wow. The engineer raised these concerns with Takata's senior vice president of quality assurance, but the vice president failed to take action to address it. These new documents that we note in this report from the committee speak for themselves. Takata failed to prioritize the safety of its products, and as a result, nine people are dead and dozens were injured. And even after exploding Takata airbags killed these innocent people, company employees continued to manipulate safety testing data. This is not only inexcusable, it is reprehensible. We have these thousands of automobile dealers around the country who have sold vehicles with the Takata airbags. They cannot sell a new vehicle if that vehicle is under recall because of a Takata airbag. Under law, they cannot sell that new vehicle. Also, rental car companies that have more than 15 cars cannot rent cars if they are under recall. But used car dealers can sell used cars that have a defective Takata airbags in them that is under recall--without fixing it. I really feel for our automobile dealers. I really feel for our automobile dealers also because what in the world are they going to do with the customers now screaming ``Replace this airbag'' when, in fact, there are not enough replacement airbags? In fact, because the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has allowed some of these replacements to go in with this ammonium nitrate, this is a horrendous situation. So I come to the floor today--this has been going on for over 2 years. We brought this out in a hearing in the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. And today I urge Takata and NHTSA to do what should have been done long ago: Stop producing these ammonium nitrate airbags and get them out of people's vehicles. And by the way, give your automobile dealers some relief. And how about giving the American driving public, which is driving around with one of these things in their face, some consideration and put them first? Hopefully, we will see some more action on this. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.",package_114_144.csv,10808,10808,10879,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [senate] [pages s942-s943] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] takata airbags mr. president, i came here to speak about something else--something that looks very sinister. as a matter of fact, i ask unanimous consent to have two items to show to the senate with regard to the takata airbag crisis. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. nelson. it looks kind of sinister, unfortunately, because it is. it is supposed to save lives, not kill. this is an airbag. it obviously has already been inflated. it goes right in the steering wheel, so when you get in an accident, this inflates and fills up with gas within a split second, and that protects your head and your torso from coming forward and being injured. what happens if this malfunctions, and what happens if the very manufacture of it causes it to malfunction under conditions? let me show you what happens. i said these things look pretty sinister. indeed, this is pretty sinister because this is a fragment that was in the metal casing in one of these airbags in florida that, when it malfunctioned, caused the explosive force of the ammonium nitrate gas. it was so explosive that it ripped apart the metal casing, and this part that i am showing came flying into the face of the driver, severely injuring the driver. in this case it hit the forehead. i have told the senate on many occasions that fragments of metal like this have come out just within the orlando area of my state. they found a woman in the middle of an intersection where she had a collision, and when the police arrived, they found out that she was dead. she had bled to death. they looked at her neck and it was slashed. the police's immediate response was that this was a homicide. upon reflection, she had a collision in the intersection that otherwise would have been a major fender bender, but because of a defective takata airbag, it sent a piece of metal like this into her neck and cut her jugular vein. near orlando, a firefighter--a big, strapping, 6-foot-4 hunk of a man--doesn't have an eye anymore because a piece of metal fragment like this one from a takata airbag came out when there was nothing more than a fender bender. when this bag exploded, it sent out a piece of metal. in his case, that firefighter doesn't have the sight in one eye because this piece of metal fragment hit him. unfortunately, this has happened all over the country. unfortunately, it has happened with a great deal of, shall we say, dragging of feet, coverup, and obfuscation. these airbags are supposed to save lives, but when they fail, they rupture violently and they send metal fragments right at the driver or the passenger. these takata airbags have such an explosive force. what is behind it? well, our staff on the commerce committee has just produced a report which this senator is releasing today. it is an update on this report which found, through a review of recently obtained internal documents in the takata corporation, that takata employees routinely manipulated safety testing data. that would be bad enough, but let's see the consequence of this drip, drip, drip approach to now a substantial number of recalls. there [[page s943]] were a million vehicles recalled in 1 week, a million more the next, and there is no end in sight. a few days ago, there was a reuters report that said that in addition to the already 20-plus million recalls of takata airbags, an additional 70 to 90 million takata airbags may have to be recalled right here in the united states. can you imagine what that is going to do to all these poor auto dealers? i mean, don't even speak about the person who is in the greatest jeopardy, the one who is behind the wheel of a car with an explosive grenade right in front of their face, and the grenade may go off. but can you imagine the poor auto dealers, the toyotas, the hondas? let me tell you about the last person killed. he was in a ford f-150 pickup truck, and it was in south carolina. by the time people got to the truck after the crash that would not have killed him, he was dead because of a fragment like this. i wish you could see this fragment. i wouldn't want that hitting me with an explosive force that inflates the airbag in less than 1 second. that is why the commerce committee has decided to jump all over this. we have been doing it for the last 2 years. we had a hearing on this 2 years ago. on the current recall, i said it was in excess of 20 million. it is actually 29 million with these defective inflators. that is because nine people are dead and dozens are injured. we find out now that in all, there may be 120 million airbags that eventually in the united stated alone will have to be recalled. if you want a shocking figure, there may be in excess of 260 million airbags recalled worldwide. knowing of all these problems, it is puzzling that the consent order that the national highway traffic safety administration signed with takata allows the continued production of ammonium nitrate-based inflators indefinitely. then they said that certain ones had to be phased out by 2018. why isn't the nhtsa taking a more aggressive approach? what is going on after all of these inflators, based on what we see with ammonium nitrate, have exploded? the essence of this and of the report we are releasing today as an addendum to the previous report is that the current recall may have to be redone. why? because auto manufacturers are installing new live grenades into people's cars as replacements for the old live grenades. according to reuters and the new york times, there are also internal documents that show takata officials were aware of these consistent problems at its manufacturing plants. these reports claim that officials knew of manufacturing issues that could lead to moisture contamination, contaminating the ammonium nitrate wafer inside of the airbag inflator. this just adds all the more to the finding of evidence. last june, the oversight and investigations staff of the commerce committee released a report on the takata airbag fiasco showing that the company knew there were serious production and testing issues dating back more than one decade. that is why we wanted to release this report today. through a thorough review of recently obtained internal documents at takata, it was discovered that takata employees continually manipulated the safety testing done. for example, in this report, in a 2005 memo to the takata vice president, an engineer at takata explained that ``the integrity of the validation reports . . . is in serious question.'' that engineer continued: ``these are not trivial changes in that the data clearly in violation of the customer specs is altered to meet the customer specs.'' the engineer called that ``a clear misrepresentation of the facts.'' that is what the takata engineer said to one of the takata vice presidents back in 2005. that was 11 years ago. in a 2006 email, a different engineering manager explained that testing reports were ``cherry picked'' and a takata employee was ``schmoozed'' to accept deviations in the data. so was he schmoozed or intimidated? whatever it was, it was altering what was the truth. the manager concluded--this is the takata manager in 2006, which was 10 years ago--that ``the plant should have been screaming bloody murder long ago.'' well, if i were a lawyer making a case to a jury, i would rest my case right now. the fact is, we are not lawyers arguing to a jury. as senators, we are here to try to protect the american people. and this data manipulation has continued. even after the recalls had been announced and the rupturing inflators had caused deaths and injuries, the data manipulation continued. i will give an example. a 2010 presentation explains that an experimental inflator was experiencing a significant safety and weld quality issue. according to that presentation, ``[takata japan] was informed of these results, but altered them and reported good results to honda.'' furthermore, even when these issues were raised to senior takata employees, no action was taken. in a takata director's notes from 2013, he explains that he shared his view that the range of a certain recall might be a ``violation of our moral obligation to protect the public.'' let me repeat that. a ``violation of our moral obligation to protect the public''--that came from a takata director. wow. the engineer raised these concerns with takata's senior vice president of quality assurance, but the vice president failed to take action to address it. these new documents that we note in this report from the committee speak for themselves. takata failed to prioritize the safety of its products, and as a result, nine people are dead and dozens were injured. and even after exploding takata airbags killed these innocent people, company employees continued to manipulate safety testing data. this is not only inexcusable, it is reprehensible. we have these thousands of automobile dealers around the country who have sold vehicles with the takata airbags. they cannot sell a new vehicle if that vehicle is under recall because of a takata airbag. under law, they cannot sell that new vehicle. also, rental car companies that have more than 15 cars cannot rent cars if they are under recall. but used car dealers can sell used cars that have a defective takata airbags in them that is under recall--without fixing it. i really feel for our automobile dealers. i really feel for our automobile dealers also because what in the world are they going to do with the customers now screaming ``replace this airbag'' when, in fact, there are not enough replacement airbags?

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS943,CREC-2016-02-23,114,GUANTANAMO DETAINEES (Executive Calendar),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S943-S952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUANTANAMO DETAINEES Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about President Obama's plan to move Guantanamo Bay terrorists to the United States. However, it is not much of a plan. With all due respect, it is more of a failed attempt to fulfill a campaign promise and, in my view, what he believes will secure his legacy. Fortunately for us--those who believe that moving dangerous enemy combatants within our communities is dangerous, irresponsible, and an illogical idea--the President's plan contains nothing really substantive. In fact, it fails to recommend an alternative location to any current facility at all. As a matter of fact, I call that a win. The plan does not provide any intelligence to substantiate the President's claims, nor does it even provide a chart or a graph to support the mathematics on the alleged cost savings, and there is no estimate regarding the cost to [[Page S944]] local and State governments to support such a move. Indeed, the 9-page report is short in every regard. The White House received the Department of Defense's results of their site surveys and other data regarding a potential closing last month. And this--I am holding up the report here--this is all we have in return: 9 pages. I know the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, my good friend and colleague, Senator John McCain, is not going to be pleased with the lack of substance or data or the articulation of a real plan. The same goes for Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who at this particular time is going to be introducing legislation of his own to provide intelligence with regard to the administration's lack of intelligence on moving detainees to the United States. The lack of a plan and the inability of this administration to provide an alternative site indicate that none of the sites visited by DOD's survey team met the demands necessary to hold detainees and, more important, keep our community safe. The fact that no site was named and no substance on those visits was provided tells me there is no alternative to match what we are now doing safely and securely at Gitmo, period. This so-called plan, as outlined by the President in his speech today from the White House, skims over four steps to closing Guantanamo Bay. First, it articulates the administration's plan to continue moving detainees designated for transfer by the President's national security team to foreign countries. In some instances, this may have been successful with regard to individuals being rehabilitated, but a third of the time, detainees transferred to third-party host countries have returned to the battlefield. And these are just the ones we know about. This is called recidivism, and the rates are too high for this process to be called ``secure and responsible,'' as the administration has labeled it. Second, the administration plans to continue its review of the threat posed by those detainees who are not currently eligible for transfer through the Periodic Review Board. This is to provide a new review on the current population of detainees who have been deemed too dangerous to transfer--deemed too dangerous to transfer, and yet this President wants to give them a second shot at getting out. This doesn't make any sense. Terrorists are not criminals. As much as this President would like for you to believe they are, terrorists are not equal to the inmates we have across America's prison system. They are fixated on the destruction of America. They have no regard for life, not that of their own and especially not the lives of innocent civilians. The report hones in on having a detainee population anywhere from 30 to 60. There seems to be an assumption on the part of the President that the review board will determine that half of those deemed too dangerous for transfer or release are suddenly safe for transfer or release. Does the President believe this is possible or does this assumption simply serve his own means to create cost savings for his plan that can never be realized? The plan also fails to account for the fact that our Nation is still mired in the War on Terrorism. We are still fighting in the Middle East and worldwide, including the United States of America, to ensure that terrorism does not prevail. What about the individuals we detain from this day forward? What about those individuals with critical information related to the next terrorist threat? How can we operate without a facility like Guantanamo Bay to hold terrorists we take off the battlefield? Third, the plan attempts to identify individual dispositions, one by one, for those who remain designated for continued law of war detention, to include Article III, military commissions, or foreign prosecutions. What a muddle. In his remarks today, President Obama advocated for trying terrorist suspects in Article III courts. The President named two American citizens--Faisal Shahzad and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev--to articulate his point. Both of those individuals, however, were apprehended in the United States, not on the battlefield. The intent of the Guantanamo detention facility is to protect the American people by removing terrorists from the battlefield. As the United States faces a growing threat from terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, which have tens of thousands of members, bringing those terrorists to the United States to stand trial simply cannot be the answer. It is not safe for the American people and irresponsible to our national security. Fourth, the plan states the administration's desire to ``work with Congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' That is in quotes, ``work with Congress.'' Well, there is something that is unique with the President, ``work with Congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' But it does not anywhere in its nine pages endorse a specific facility to house Guantanamo detainees; rather, the plan describes a prototype for a detention facility in the United States--not Kansas, not Colorado, not South Carolina, not anywhere in the United States. The President's long-awaited plan is to work with Congress to identify the most appropriate location as soon as possible, according to the summary provided to my office by the Department of Defense. Question: How could it take 7 years to arrive at the idea to work with Congress? What a novel idea, but only for this express purpose. If the President had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in this plan. If he had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in 2009 when we stopped his plan the first time. Further, the plan fails to substantiate President Obama's repeated claims that Guantanamo Bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists. Let me repeat this. The plan fails to substantiate President Obama's repeated claims that Guantanamo Bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists, a rallying point for terrorist attacks, hindering relations with allies, and draining Department of Defense resources. My goodness. I wrote Defense Secretary Ash Carter in November to ask for intelligence reports or data to support many of these assertions. I asked Secretary Carter if an intelligence assessment has been done in conjunction with the site surveys recently conducted by the Department of Defense from the safety of our community's standpoint. I asked for the Department's rationale for evaluating Fort Leavenworth, when three previous evaluations have made it abundantly clear it is and continues to be an unacceptable alternative. I asked if there were intelligence products regarding previous site evaluations at Fort Leavenworth. The administration has argued that Guantanamo is a recruiting tool for terrorists. So I logically asked for an intelligence assessment to support that argument. As a follow on, I asked what assessment had been done to reflect that Guantanamo has increased terrorist recruitment. And finally, was there any empirical data to support the administration's argument that national security threats will decrease if enemy combatants are held in the United States? Common sense will tell you that it would increase. Two months later, the response confirmed my assumptions. The Department of Defense had no intelligence products--none. There were no intelligence products, no data to provide to support the President's argument that GTMO serves as a recruiting tool and that moving detainees to the mainland would increase security and decrease the terrorist threat to the United States. My colleagues, this plan really confirms what many of us already know: There is no safe alternative to GTMO--not in Kansas, not in Colorado, not in South Carolina. Nowhere on the mainland is there a secure and responsible alternative. If there were, this President would not have failed to articulate it in his plan. Mr. President, a plan that is a legacy speech does not safeguard the lives of the American people. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on the nomination. Mr. MANCHIN. I wish to speak on the nomination of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Robert Califf. [[Page S945]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I believe the FDA needs new leadership, a new focus and a new culture, and Dr. Robert Califf's past involvement with the pharmaceutical industry reflects that he will not be this person. He will not have the impact or leadership capabilities the Nation needs to stem the tide of the opioid crisis we have all over this country, even in your great State of Oklahoma and my State of West Virginia, which has been ravaged by this. I would like to put this in context for a little bit. He has been there over a year--a good man. I am not speaking about his ability, his honesty, his integrity, his education, his background, and all the good work he has done. But he has been there for a year, and for the past 20 years Dr. Califf basically has come from the institutional research side, from education, and with that, his support has come from the pharmaceutical industries, those that are putting opioids on the market. I just feel it would be hard, human naturewise, for him to change and rule to keep these products from coming onto the market. So to put this in context, this is not personally about Dr. Califf. This is about the culture he comes from and the year he has been there as the No. 2 man and what has happened during that period of time. Let me go over some things. Over the last decade, the FDA has approved new drugs at historically high rates. In 2008, companies filing applications to sell never-before-marketed drugs were denied 66 percent of the time. They were denied 66 percent of the time. Yet between the beginning of 2015 and August of 2015, the FDA rejected only 3 uses for new chemical entities and approved 25. That is an approval rate of 89 percent. Now, tell me how in 7 short years that culture changed to where anything and everything coming at us was passed through, when we have already become the most addicted country on Earth. If one looks at new drugs and not the use of drugs, they have rejected only 1 and approved 23. That is a 96-percent approval rate in 2015. So of the new drugs that came to the market, only 1 was rejected--a 96-percent approval rate. In 2008, the FDA's approval of new marketing claims for existing drugs was 56 percent. In the first 8 months of 2015, it was 88 percent. This includes approving OxyContin for children as young as 11. The FDA's 2013 approval of Zohydro drew widespread concern. All of us were outraged when we heard this new drug came on the market. To put another time period in context, I had worked for 3 years to try to get all opioids from a schedule III to a schedule II so doctors could prescribe only for 30 days. You had to go back and see your doctor. Up until that time, Vicodin and Lortab--the two most widely prescribed opioids--were schedule III. That means you could get a 90- day prescription and then call in to get it refilled. They were going out like M&Ms. We were able to do that, and no sooner did we get that done--and it took 3 years, when it should have been 3 weeks. Within the same week that all opioids got to us from a schedule III to a schedule II, they approved a new drug called Zohydro, which was 10 times more powerful than Vicodin or Lortab--much more powerful. That approval was done against their advisory committee 11 to 2. That means 13 experts evaluated this drug and said: It is not needed, too powerful, don't do it. Guess what, they did it anyway. Now they are saying that they are not going to pay attention to the advisory committee. Not only did they say they are not going to pay attention to the advisory committee, but we have had the decision on OxyContin being given to 11-year-old children; we have had the two new drugs that came out in 2014 after Zohydro and the pushback from Senators representing our respective States; they had a new drug called Targiniq, which is an extended-release OxyContin product, and Hysingla, which is an extended-release hydrocodone product. So there were three new decisions made, with two new powerful opioids coming to the market and the decision that OxyContin would be given to 11-year-olds. That was done without any review from the advisory committee. They got so much pushback from Zohydro, they said: We are not going down this path again. We will just not have anybody review it. We will just go ahead and do it. If you believe that is a culture that will protect the welfare and well-being of our citizens in our States all through this great country of ours, then I am sorry because I don't. I am sorry, but that is why I have been so passionate. I have more people dying of legal prescription drug abuse than anything else in the State of West Virginia. More people die. It is ravaging families. I have personal letters I will read, and they will tear your heart out with what is happening and how this grips and tears people apart. It tears communities apart. Every law enforcement agency in America will tell you--no matter what town they are in, what county they are in, or what State they are in--that over 80 percent and upward of 95 percent of all crimes committed are drug related, are some sort of drug related. There is not one of us right now in this beautiful Senate Chamber that doesn't know somebody in our immediate family or Senate family that hasn't been affected by drugs, either prescription legal drugs or illegal drugs. It is awful. It is an epidemic. I believe the FDA must break its cozy relationship with the pharmaceutical industry and instead start a relationship with the millions of Americans. I have said that I am going to fight against the FDA protecting a business plan and hopefully the culture will change, and they will start protecting America and the plan of families and citizens of this great country to have a healthy lifestyle. It is because of this belief that I am urging my colleagues to vote against the confirmation of Dr. Robert Califf as the director of the Food and Drug Administration. He will still be there and still be a valuable person. He is just not that person with the passion to change the culture in this important agency. We have let this sleeping giant go for far too long. My office has been absolutely flooded, Mr. President, with stories from West Virginians--but I have received them from all over the country--who want their voices to be heard. They say: Please use my name. I am not ashamed. We have been hiding too long. I have watched too many people's lives be destroyed. So today I will read letters not only from West Virginians but also people across this great country of ours that have been impacted by the opioid abuse epidemic. I urge my colleagues to listen to these letters from their States and stories from my State about these drugs before confirming Dr. Califf, and in all good conscience make that decision tomorrow when we vote. Do you really believe he can bring the changes needed and not just say: Well, we have to have somebody there. He is already there. He will do a good job where he is; he is just not going to be able to kick them and shake them up and say we are not going down this path any more. There are some good people. We have made some recommendations of some good people who would bring the cultural changes that need to be brought. I am going to read first about a young lady from Southern West Virginia. Her name is Chelsea. This is her story. As a recovering addict, I have watched myself, my friends, and loved ones suffer from this horrible thing we call addiction. As I watch all these people now suffering, I know they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, and neither did I. Whether it be for pain or just simply hanging with the wrong people like I did, we all have one thing in common, we chose to do drugs for the first time. Someone made a decision to do drugs for the first time. Growing up, I can honestly say I had what most people would call a normal childhood. Chelsea comes from an upper socioeconomic family in Southern West Virginia. She continues: I was raised by two hardworking parents who would and will still do anything for me. I was a gymnast and a cheerleader for most of my life and went to church every Wednesday and Sunday. My dad was even the Mayor of Madison at one point. But even being raised up in a good home did not stop me from doing drugs. So this has no socioeconomic bearing. It does not. It is not a partisan issue. Whether you are a Democrat or [[Page S946]] Republican, it makes no difference. Rich or poor makes no difference. Chelsea continues: I can still remember the first time I heard about someone getting high. I was in the 6th grade and became friends with a girl whose parents got high themselves. We would walk about the playground and she would talk of these things called ``drugs.'' As she talked day in and day out about how getting high made her feel, it made me start to wonder what this thing called ``getting high'' was really about. Now, mind you, I am talking about a 12-year-old girl. She was just 12 years old. I can remember thinking how cool I thought it was that her parents had done drugs with her and would party with her. So another friend of hers, also 12 years old, had parents who were doing drugs with her and would party with her. Chelsea continues: One weekend I went to her house to stay the night and this was the first time I had gotten high. We smoked some pot, drank some alcohol, and I was turned on to my first pill around the age of 12. From this day forward, my life would forever be changed. From the ages twelve to fifteen I partied some on the weekends and sometimes during the week, but as time went on my addiction and tolerance grew more and more. By this time, I was doing more pills because I had access to them. Between stealing Lortabs off my dad, to hanging with that girl so we could get high with her dad, to buying pills off the local drug dealer on the street, I had moved from doing them every now and then to every day. I would stay a lot of weekends at this girl's house just to get high because my parents would never have done that nor did they know I was doing it. By sixteen my life took another turn. My grandmother, who I called Nana, had taken care of me most of my life while my mother worked. She was diagnosed with lung cancer two years prior. In the last days of her life, I would visit her in the hospital and she would tell me how proud she was of me and how I was her little model. I had also met a very special guy by the name of J.R. a few months before this who I spent a lot of time with. On July 18, 2003, my Nana passed away. On the day of her wake, J.R. took me out to dinner, and on the way home he asked me to go meet his dad. I explained to him I could not and that my grandma's funeral was the next day. He dropped me off that night, kissed me good-bye, and that was the last time I ever heard from J.R. Twenty minutes after he left me, he wrecked and died. I felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. The day of his funeral is the next time I met the love of my life that would soon try to destroy my life. It was called OxyContin. I fell in love immediately with OxyContin. It took all of my cares and worries away, and from that moment on all I wanted to do was be numb. As the years passed, my drug addiction grew worse. I was not only doing pain pills, I was now experimenting with all kinds of other things. I can still remember my senior week in high school. While everyone was excited about going to the beach, I had to make sure I had enough drugs to go and not be sick. I took Roxy's and Oxy's, pretty much anything I could get my hands on, and eight balls of cocaine. By this time in my life I didn't care about anything. It never once had crossed my mind that if I got caught with all of that I could go to jail. I was just worried about my next high. The following months were the same. I was doing anything I could to get my hands on drugs, from pain pills to cocaine to meth. I did not care as long as I was high. I was hanging around with people who were as sick as I was and places that I look back now that I would not even take my dog. At 19 I met a guy who would fuel my drug addiction even more. He was 40 years old and dealt OxyContin. At this point I could not afford my habit, so I did what I had to do. I started seeing my drug dealer. My life soon went from bad to worse. I had OxyContin 80s any time I wanted them, and at the time I thought life can't get any better than this. When you are doing eight to ten OxyContin 80s a day, you will do whatever it takes to get them. At this point I was turned on to heroin. Heroin would have taken my life if it hadn't scared me so much. The high from heroin is so intense that anyone who had done it would have fallen in love. But, actually, it scared the life out of me. As time passed and I wasn't getting high like I wanted to anymore from snorting OxyContin, I decided to start shooting up. That is one thing I never thought I would do is shoot up. I always told myself that people who shot up were the homeless people on the streets, complete and utter trash. Now here I was sticking a needle in my arm to get what I wanted. And to be honest, I thought life was bad before. It just got a whole lot worse. The life I was and the life that I knew was gone, and OxyContin was completely ruling my life now. OxyContin is a legal drug made by a legal pharmaceutical that knew exactly the effects this would have when they put this on the market over 20 years ago. She said: What stood before everyone was pure addiction. I had started stealing off of everyone by now and didn't care who I hurt. People's priceless possessions that meant so much to them meant nothing to me. All I'd seen was my next fix. That's all I could see. People were bringing me stolen stuff and I was taking it to the nearest pawn shop or my drug dealer. I had no shame. I had needle marks all up and down my arms, and I would lie to my family about how they got there. It was like I had no conscience, or, better yet, my addiction was my conscience. Eventually I got caught stealing and was charged with 17 different felonies and one misdemeanor. This still did not slow me down even though I was looking at two to 20 years in prison. Nothing scared me more than being sick from the drugs. On September 29, 2008, I was called in for a random drug test and failed because I had shot up OxyContin the day before. At the courthouse they handcuffed me and shackled me and sent me to Southwestern Regional Jail where I did a total of 10 days. As I sat there in that jail cell and cried, I thought a pill could not be worth two to 20 years of my life, and I hit my knees and prayed to God that if He brought me out of that jail cell, that I would never, ever, ever touch drugs again. The Lord answered my prayer and the judge gave me the choice to stay in jail or go to the Life Center of Galax, in Galax, Virginia. I chose to go to rehab. I completed the 30-day program and came back and did Thomas Memorial's intense outpatient program for 6 more weeks. Once I got home I was sentenced to two to 20 years, but they suspended my sentence. I went through drug court and completed it. I was the third person to ever graduate from the Lincoln County Drug Court. I also had to do 14 more days in jail, 6 months of home confinement, and 4 years' probation. I can honestly say that going to jail and rehab saved my life. If I hadn't have been put in jail, I would probably be 6 feet in the ground just like a lot of my friends that I had to bury. All of these things combined gave me something I hold very dear to my heart. My recovery. Recovery has not only given my life back. It has given me a chance to be a daughter, a sister, a wife, and hopefully a mother someday, a productive member of society, a good friend, but most of all, my recovery has given me a chance to be the voice of the sick and suffering addicts who lay in bed at night wondering if there is a way out. I enjoy giving people hope and showing them that treatment does work. I am living proof that if you work the program of recovery, it will work for you. Since that day I had found myself sitting in that jail cell with no hope and my life completely consumed by my addiction, my life has changed for the better. I have graduated with an Associate's Degree in applied science from Southern West Virginia Community Technical College. I went on to get my Bachelor's degree in the arts of psychology from West Virginia State University, and now I am currently working on my Masters of Social Work degree at Concord University, and I will graduate with that degree in May. I have also been able to go to various schools, drug courts, and different places around the state to tell my story of addiction from where I was then to where I am now. I have also had the pleasure of working with a great group of people who are trying to get a sober living home open in Danville, West Virginia called the Hero House. I can tell you, she is so passionate about getting this Hero House so she can help other people. Anybody listening who wants to help Chelsea in Danville, WV, with the Hero House, please do so or contact my office. Now, with all this being said, I don't tell my story to get praise. I tell my story because there is a son, a daughter, a husband, a father, a wife, and many, many other people out there addicted to drugs and they do not see a light at the end of the tunnel. When you are in active addiction, that light is so dim and a lot of times people think they are going to die from this horrible disease. But I am here to show people that you don't have to die. You don't have to let that horrible addiction win. You can step out and take your life back, because I am here to tell you that if you don't, if you don't, your addiction is going to take you to your grave. Drugs do not discriminate. They know no good, no bad, no rich, no poor. There are so many people out there who suffer from this because there is little to no treatment. By the grace of God I was sent to rehab and given a second chance. I still have the horrible reminders every day of the things I did to my family, to my body, and, most of all, to my self-esteem. I have the track marks after being 7 years sober that constantly remind me of the life I once lived. I have a poor self-image because of the men I chose to give myself to just to get a pill, and the damage I did to my family because I had no cares in the world. One day I hope there is enough treatment to help the addicts who want help. People need to be given a second chance and shown there is a better way of life than to do drugs. [[Page S947]] I have another story called Tami's story, but I know Chelsea. I know this girl. She is impressive. She said: Please tell my story, I want people to know. No one could come from a finer family than I came from. No one can go lower than I have gone, and no one but by the grace of God could be saved like I was. When we hear these stories--and all she is saying is there is no treatment. She was lucky. She found a treatment center. Somehow we have to come to grips with this. We have a tax on tobacco because we know it is harmful and we have to cure people of the disease. We have a tax on alcohol. We have no fee whatsoever on opiates--none--and it is destroying lives like nothing else that has ever happened in this country. We need to make people conscious of this, and we need to have an FDA that is compassionate, but not only that, is committed to the change that needs to be made in our culture. I want to read Tami's story, from West Virginia. That is in the northern panhandle. Chelsea was way down in the southern part of our State of West Virginia. We have 2 adult children suffering from substance use disorder. Our son entered the military while in college. He was sent to Iraq right after 9/11, December 27, 2001. He experienced things that he never talked about, celebrated his 21st birthday there, and returned home. He was not a saint when he went to war. He had a juvenile past of drinking. Back then we thought he was a typical teenager acting out. When he returned, he suffered PTSD, as many do, and went to the VA hospital for treatment. He was put on cocktail after cocktail of medications. We all know this. We all know that basically these brave men and women who are willing to risk their lives and sacrifice their lives for us--in order to treat their pain, we think, just give them a prescription, and they are able to get anything and everything. That is what they are talking about when he was put on cocktail after cocktail of medications--was this his starting point of the spiral into addiction? I believe his addiction to opioids, benzoids, and amphetamines started then. I know that he spiraled from that point on. He lost his marriage, he didn't see his son, he bounced from drugs to drugs to drugs. He obtained several DUIs, and time after time he walked away, no offer of help, no sentencing. He bounced, married again. She was addicted to heroin. He bounced again, was in and out of our house. Unfortunately, we always gave him a safe place to land. She said: ``Unfortunately,''--not fortunately but unfortunately--``we always gave him a safe place to land.'' The last time I saw him is when I called the police on him. I discovered that him and his girlfriend, with two small children, who had been living in our house for four months were using and selling drugs. I found out he was recently incarcerated for drug traffic and sent to a correctional rehabilitation facility. Our daughter was an athlete all through school. She received injury after injury, and at 18 started seeing specialists for back pain. That was in 2004. They prescribed opiates. I never saw the addiction coming. She lost her best friend since first grade that year to a drunk driving accident. She went to counseling. More prescriptions. She appeared fine, gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, and then because of back pain more pain prescriptions were given. I realized she had a problem when she was pregnant with her second child and was stepped down to Vicodin while pregnant. Vicodin while pregnant. After his birth, we started her first rehab experience. She returned to the father of her children sober. She relapsed and began snorting heroin. At this time she was living in Ohio and we were unaware of her relapse. We found out when her mother-in-law went to court and took her children. That was one of the worst days of all of our lives. We immediately picked her up, brought her back to West Virginia, and into treatment. Fast forward. Thousands of dollars later on attorneys, doctors, rehab, she returns to Ohio to try to obtain her children. Relapsed. She began shooting heroin and then arrested. We let her sit in jail and picked her up on her release. Charges were dismissed. Back to West Virginia she comes, hospitalized for a week and rehab again. She has now been in recovery for 13 months. She fell in love with a nice, drug-free man, moved to Ohio to try to obtain custody of her children back, and is six months pregnant. One thing I can say is my daughter was always a good mother. Even while on active addiction, she worked and took care of them. As you can tell, both of our children became addicted to prescription drugs first. . . And they tell me this is exactly how it starts. It starts at a very young age. Recreational marijuana, prescription drugs out of your parents' medicine cabinet, taking it to school, being the cool kid in school, sharing those drugs, then you begin using them, then you sell them. This is how it starts, and it leads to obtaining street drugs to feed their addiction. So it goes from occasional to recreational to addiction to feeding that addiction. This is a condensed version of course. As with any family dealing with addiction, it does not show the tears, the hurt, the financial breakdown put on the family; (we are broke). Literally and figuratively. She says: I want to thank you for listening. Doctors keep prescribing pills, and they will tell you that they have had very little training in this area. As they go through all of their medical schools and advanced training, they get very little training on the effects these drugs have on human beings and the addiction. We took 1 billion pills off the market when we went from 90 days to 30 days of Vicodin and Lortab. We took that many pills off the market. That means 30 days. I have people in my office or in their families--and I know the Presiding Officer does as well--who will go to the doctor for something where they may need pain relief for 1 or 2 days. Do you know what they get? They automatically get enough pills for 30 days. That is the path of least resistance. It is legal, they can do it, and the doctor will write a 30-day prescription. We are working on a bill that will be coming to the floor. We need to make a lot of changes to that bill, but most importantly, we need to make sure we have an agency in the Federal Government of the United States of America that is fighting to protect every American. And it is not a business plan that we have to adhere to, not at all. These are good companies. They are legal pharmaceutical companies. They do an awful lot of good. I challenge every one of them that is listening to what we are talking about right now to give us pain relief without addiction to opioids. Do something. Break through the chemistry or something. It has to be there. We have been able to solve every other epidemic. We have been able to cure epidemics and pandemics, and now we have one that has been ravaging our country for almost 30 years. I have Samantha's story. She says: Hello. My name is Samantha Holbrooke. She wants you to know her name. I am from Fayette County, WV. I am a 28-year-old female. I have been an addict for the past 6 years. This letter is to explain to you how addiction has affected my life. It is also to express my view on drugs and what it is doing to our society. I first started drugs when I was 13 years old. I was a recreational marijuana user. My mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict. My father was not in the home or involved in my life. Unfortunately, that is true for many people around this country. My mother would allow me to drink with her and go to bars. I was often her designated driver, but I was only 13 years old. I got in my first and only bar fight at 13. It was with a 24-year-old woman. She thought I was coming on to her boyfriend. In reality, we were smoking weed, not trying to hook up. When I was 19, my oldest sister and mother introduced me to hydrocodone, Ritalin, Xanax, and Percocet. My sister and mother had no income; I did. By getting me on pills, they were able to get free pills by charging me to get them for them. By the time I was 22, I think I was snorting Oxycodone. Oxycodone is made in a single source, which is a powder form that is compressed. They would break it down, crush it, and snort it to get the quicker high. That became my drug of choice. I eventually got in with a doctor who was pretty much a pill mill. We know we have them all over this country. He wrote me a prescription for Xanax and Oxycodone. I got even more strung out on those two. As a result of using drugs, I now have memory problems, concentration problems, and the list goes on and on. I lost about 30 pounds. I lost my job. I lost my home. I lost my child. I lost my fiance to suicide. He was drunk when he shot himself in the head. I believe that had he not been drinking, he wouldn't have taken his own life. As a result of these life-changing events, I became severely depressed. I then took the wrong road and began to use drugs intravenously. I started lying and stealing. This led me to gain two felony charges and several other misdemeanors. I went to jail and prison and spent 2\1/2\ years locked up. I am now on DRC because I am on parole and had a relapse, which led to several bad decisions, and now I am paying the consequences. I am now in recovery. I am a recovering addict. I joined Narcotics Anonymous and [[Page S948]] Alcoholics Anonymous. The classes and programming in prison helped me to think better. I now analyze a situation before making a decision. This is my story. Prescription drugs and all drugs have ruined a large percentage of the citizens of West Virginia's lives. I am now in full control of my life again, thank the Lord. This story is anonymous, but they wanted to share it with us. I grew up in a nice home. My grandfather was a pastor. My dad grew up in church. My family went to church every Sunday. We had a nice house. We had nice cars. My mom didn't have to work, and my dad took very good care of us. My dad had surgery, a common surgery to remove several large veins in his legs. This is where his addiction began. This is where he found his unlimited supply of numbness. I was in middle school, and this is when I remember things being different. Things were changing. My dad stayed out with his friends a lot. He wasn't home for dinner anymore. When he was home, he was lying down sleepy and always said silly things. I would stay up late at night until he would get home, only to hear my mom and dad fighting, screaming, and my mom crying. Eventually I hated to hear the garage door open because I didn't want him to come home. Before my dad would take me to school, standing in his business suit with his briefcase, he would scarf down pills out of a little orange bottle. He would tip it back like he was eating a box of Nerds. I didn't know any better. My naive, my innocent mind didn't know what was happening. I couldn't comprehend that a doctor could be his drug dealer! They couldn't comprehend that because we have been taught to trust doctors. Things got worse. I started finding bottles of liquor and cans of beer hidden, and I passed it off. The 3 empty beers in the back of his company car: Oh, they must be his ``friends''. No one in our family drinks, definitely not my dad. I remember whole vacations, weekend trips, and afternoons ruined by his addiction. Mad fits of rage until one day my mom stood up and couldn't take it anymore. My dad got the help he needed, but how did he get the help? In hiding, in private--a local rehab facility. He was on a business trip. Our culture has stigmatized a group of people--a group of people who transcend race, status, gender--at the expense of their lives. This is a hidden killer. Drug abuse and drug addiction are hidden killers. So many of us have people in our families or close friends who don't want to talk about it. They are ashamed, and so it gets covered up and hidden away. As a result, we don't bring people out, let them know the effects, and cure them. She says: My dad was hurting. No, not from the wounds on his legs when he had his surgery but from depression and bipolar disorder. These are the roots of his addiction. They go hand in hand. When will we see this? When will we stop seeing addicts as a problem and see them as human beings and hurting? For the last 20 to 30 years, I have been in public life, and the Presiding Officer has been in public life a good bit. I always thought that anybody who fools with drugs is a criminal and should be put in jail. We have done that, and it hasn't solved a thing. It has gotten a lot worse. We have to rethink this issue. This is not a crime. Addiction is basically an illness. It needs to have a cure, and treatment is that cure. We have to face that. Senate Republicans and Democrats are looking at how to fix the sentencing guidelines, and I think it is encouraging and healthy for us to have these discussions. She says: Is it a selfish sickness? Of course it is. But how can we help them see the light when we push them aside? Because ``they asked for it?'' Just like a lady with skin cancer ``asked for it'' because she laid in a tanning bed? What if we treated addicts with the same compassion that we treat cancer patients? My father has been clean for almost a decade, and the demons of his addiction still haunt us all. No, we weren't homeless, nor did we have to face a death to be completely broken by this horrible epidemic, but I had a zombie for a father for my adolescence. I missed my childhood, years that we can never get back, memories that will never be erased, all because of a little orange pill bottle chased and hidden with a brown paper bag. Luckily, my story ends with a happy ending. I still have my dad. My story hasn't ended up the way so many do every day, like my two friends who didn't get help in time and passed away. I have stories from all over the country, and they are pathetic. I have a couple more I can read from West Virginia. I will go to different States. This is Erica's story. She says: Hello, My name is Erica and I am an addict. And I say that with great pride as I celebrated 10 years of recovery in November of 2015. I began using drugs here in West Virginia at the ripe age of 13. Thirteen seems to be that magic--adolescence. We are coming into adolescence. We are willing to experiment. We think we are invincible. We think nothing can harm us. Prescription drugs were easily accessible at that age and opened the door to 11 years of anguish, desperation, jails, and dirty needles. I came from a stable, drug- and alcohol- free home, but I was able to gain access to prescription drugs from my peers and my local middle school and high school on a daily basis. As my disease progressed, I dropped out of high school my freshman year and continued to put myself and family through years of pain and suffering. I attempted drug replacement therapy to control my opioid addiction, but that was only a temporary solution, and I eventually returned to drugs. Finally, I found myself in the court system and facing felony drug charges. It was then that I was able to find freedom through a 12-step fellowship. Today I can say I am a cum laude graduate of Marshall University, fully employed, homeowner, wife, and the mother of two wonderful West Virginia boys. I pray my children don't follow the path that, not only myself, but many of my West Virginians fall into. The disease of addiction is progressive and fatal if not treated or prevented. Here in West Virginia, we are leading the Nation in drug overdoses. And where I live in Cabell County, we have had over 900 overdoses in just the year of 2015. As a mother, I must trust our leaders to make responsible choices to help us seek solutions, gain back our communities, and save our children from following the same deadly path. I know the FDA was so proud that they came out with some new guidelines, and they said now they are going to start paying attention to the advisory committees. They didn't say they would adhere to their recommendations; they would just start paying attention to them. Also, the CDC--the Centers for Disease Control--put out some guidelines of how we should be prescribing, the knowledge we should have, how we should be administering, and what we should be doing to curb this drug abuse. And guess which agency fought against that and put it on delay? The FDA. The only thing I ask all of my colleagues to do is to please consider--just send a message with the vote you make tomorrow. It is not about the doctor at all. It is not about the person before us. It is about getting an advocate who will make a real change and make sure we fight this war. This story is another anonymous story: My brother is in his early 20s and was hired at the local plant that employs the majority of the county. He was injured on the job, saw his doctor, and was prescribed Lortab long term. Lortab, as I said before, is a schedule III, 90 days. You can keep calling it in, calling it in, and calling it in. As the effects from this started to wane, he was prescribed Xanax, Klonopin, and a variety of other prescription medicines. He then lost his good-paying job but found other work at a lower pay after almost a year of unemployment. This prescription med addiction continued for years, and once laws finally cracked down on prescribing narcotics, it left him unable to get all the medicines he had previously been prescribed. Once it became too expensive to buy them on the street, he turned to heroin. My fun-loving brother who was always at family functions, loved to be around his nieces and nephews, totally disappeared. I suspected that something more serious was going on, but he wouldn't answer calls or texts. In August, I hadn't seen him in several months. We have always been close. This was very unusual. I sent him a novel of a text since he wouldn't take my phone calls confronting him over the rumors that I had heard of his heroin use. He denied it. A few short weeks later, I got a call from my mother that he was transported to the hospital by ambulance but discharged a few hours later for chest pain. He later told us he had gotten a bad batch of heroin and was certain he was dying. He told the EMS he had used that morning, as well as hospital staff. I still to this day don't understand how someone can come in suffering from an overdose and be discharged a few hours later. People don't have knowledge. They are not being trained in this horrible epidemic that we have in this country. NOTHING was mentioned to him about treatment or rehab and he was treated as a [[Page S949]] lesser person. I was worried before, but after this was in a constant state of fear that I would get a call that my 31- year-old brother was dead. In October, he called me to tell me yes he was a heroin addict, but a new treatment center had opened near his home and he wanted to get clean. He asked if I would go with him, and I said of course yes. His insurance wouldn't cover a dime of this treatment. It would be all out of his pocket at $100 a day plus the cost of meds. For someone working at a $30,000 or less a year job, paying for housing, utilities, food, (he never did receive public assistance)-- He was too proud for that-- this cost was more than he could do. Again I told him I would be there and pay for whatever he couldn't. I convinced him he needed more of a support system than just me and he finally told our parents. We were we were raised in church and came from a large religious family. He was so ashamed of what he had become he didn't want the family to know and the majority of them still don't know to this day. I am hoping, as this letter was written anonymously, eventually he will share this with the family, maybe preventing other members from going down this road. He will tell them when he is ready. My mom and I went with him to his first appointment at the suboxyne clinic, and one of us has been at every appointment since. It is wonderful-- he has a session with a psychiatrist at every visit. It's more than prescribing meds. They are doing the counseling to make sure their patients get clean. I am proud to say that after only four months, not only is he clean but he has weaned off the suboxyne. He still goes for counseling and has the nurse's cell that he can call 24 hours a day if he's having a hard day. In the future he wants to tell his story and help others facing the same crisis. Madam President, I have been reading stories of people addicted all over the State of West Virginia. I have stories from your State also, Madam President. I would like to read that for you. This is in New Hampshire--Sandown, NH. This is Kathleen's story. I am sure she has sent you the same copy she sent me. She wants her name to be known. My name is Kathleen Stephens. I am a 56 year old RN, BSN, from Sandown, NH. I am currently the Director of Clinical Service at a nationwide hospice company. My story is much like thousands of others out there, pretty average, fairly normal. I have two children; a 33-year-old son who graduated with a degree in Mathematics from Boston University and a 31- year-old daughter who graduated with a psychology degree from Assumption College. I myself have a Bachelor of Science and Nursing degree and my children's father a Bachelor's degree in business from Wharton School of Business in PA. I give you this detailed background for to you see that we are a well educated and successful family. We are a white, mid to upper middle class who have always lived in a beautiful neighborhood surrounded by loving families whose children played outside, joined peewee soccer, little league, softball, basketball and girl scouts to name but a few. We were the home in the neighborhood where all the children loved to play. We took our children to drive in movies, camping, the beach, museums and always visited their grandparents. We were normal, that's all, or what we perceived was normal. When speaking with our children now, they both recount wonderful childhoods and deem themselves ``lucky.'' Our house was filled with love. I hugged my kids all the time, never hesitated to demonstrate to or tell them how much I loved them. They had grandparents who were always around, who also demonstrated love for them. About 5 years ago, my daughter, and her boyfriend, an Intern at Tufts Medical School decided, after being together for 2 years that they would move to Sacramento. I was devastated inside but encouraged my daughter to follow her heart. Over the subsequent years, our communications went from daily to weekly to scattered. Each conversation seemed more distant than the last. We saw her an average of twice a year; most significantly, when we paid her expenses to come home for Christmas. Her boyfriend never came; he distanced himself from us almost immediately. I'm sure at this point you know the story. About 18 months ago I finally confronted my daughter asking what was wrong, seeing her go from a loving daughter to a distant person I no longer knew. Over the previous few years, she turned into a virtual stranger. I told her I loved her no matter what and that I would be there for her. At that time she denied any issue. A few weeks later she was in the hospital and called me. Apparently, she had hit bottom. She confided that she was a heroin addict. I was more than shocked. She had been in a substance free dorm in college, hated drinking, drugs and was pretty straight laced overall. I kept myself in check saying that no matter what I would support her, asked her to come home so we could help her. She confided that it started with a prescription for opioids that her boyfriend had shared with her. He was given one for back pain years before, got hooked and decided she might just like it. So, amazingly she did come home, but she went back a few months later. She then returned to get clean again and went back a few months later. She overdosed multiple times, of which I knew nothing until recently. Her boyfriend gave her IV heroin while she was in the hospital being treated for pneumonia to keep her habit going. He was the one, I found out later, that he shot her up because she hated doing it. He had developed a hold on her that was a bond of heroin high. I knew the drug had gotten her when, due to the stress of everything happening, I ended up in the hospital ruling out a heart attack. She drove me there, dropped me off and went to get high (I found out later). I ended up being fine, stress of course, and she ended up going back home yet again. She stayed clean after going into a rehab, which kicked her out after 8 days because her insurance was declined. She then attended NA-- Narcotics Anonymous-- meetings almost daily and got a job that she loved. In the meantime, her boyfriend was found out through a ``random'' drug test and suspended. She was clean for 4 months, the happiest four months of my life. We spoke every few days, or texted. Her voice was truly hers again . . . her laughter, her expressions, her humor. I felt she was finally back with us. She had left her boyfriend and went into a sober living home. Life was good and I was so grateful to have my daughter, my best friend, back. About 3 months into her sobriety she decided to reach out and try to get her boyfriend sober as well, the beginning of the end. At exactly month 4 she went to his house and he had a ``surprise'' for her. She was new in her sobriety, just once she said, and she fell back down the rabbit hole. I knew when she didn't return my calls or texts that it was bad. But finally she responded; she was back into it again, but she'd get out she promised. The next 8 months were a few weeks clean then back into drugs again. I did not send her money. Honestly, she never asked. She knew I'd never support her habit. Around Thanksgiving 2015 she had had it. She called me and said she wanted to get back into rehab and leave her boyfriend permanently. Her life was no longer worth living. Weeks of trying to get her into rehab went unsuccessfully when we finally found Clean and Sober in Sacramento. At that point she was clean two weeks, had slowly packed up or sold her belongings and was ready for the break. But she had to sneak out to get away from her very controlling, manipulative partner; and she did. The happy part: She is today 60 days sober. She has a new job (She had been fired from the other one), which she loves. She blocked her boyfriend from her phone, her email and her facebook. She is the daughter, once again, that I know and love, but I love her regardless of the disease of addiction. Love the addict, hate the disease. And for right now I thank God, pray alot, and take it one day at a time. I have another one here I want to share with you. The thing I wanted to share, Madam President, is this: My State and your State have probably been hit as hard as any two States in the country. We have people coming to us all the time. We are fighting every way we can. We are introducing pieces of legislation. We are not worrying about who is Republican or Democrat. How can we help Americans--the beautiful people in New Hampshire, the wonderful people in West Virginia, who are facing more deaths, more disease, more destruction to the family? I want to share with you that when I first got elected--Senator Byrd had died in 2010. I was Governor of the State of West Virginia. I had to make a decision. I thought maybe I could come to Washington and help with the experiences I had and what I had seen in my State and times. We had challenges. After I was elected to the Senate, I had gone back to Oceana, WV. At that time it had been called ``Oxyana'' because drug use was so rampant in this beautiful town. I remembered this town because when I was a freshman in college, my roommate was from this town. It was the most beautiful town I had been in. They had everything. What a privilege it would have been to grow up in this beautiful town, but I could see many years later it was not the town I knew or remembered in my mind. I went to the middle school. These were all children in fifth to eighth grade. I tried to give pep talks. I wanted to get them involved and tell them how good they could be, how much we are counting on them, what they need to get a good education and contribute something back to society, and how fortunate and lucky they are to be in this little town. After I finished speaking--they were attentive and cooperative--there was a group of them. They asked: Can we talk to you privately? I will never forget this. These were 12- and 13-year-old [[Page S950]] boys and girls. There had to be six or seven of them. I went in the back room and sat at a table. They started talking and telling me their stories. These were stories they had watched and were telling me. This was the first time I had ever heard from a child up close and personal who said: My dad worked at the mines. He had a back problem. He got hurt. They kept giving him pills. We lost our house. Mom and dad were fighting. They got divorced. We lost everything. I've got nothing now. My grandparents were watching me while I was trying to take care of us. My dad is an addict. I heard these stories from these five kids. They were all pleading. Now fast forward to the year 2015. I go back to the same school. These kids that were 12 years old are now seniors in high school. The same group wants to talk to me. They had lived a clean life, but I think about what they have gone through and what they have seen. Then I sit down with another group of 12- and 13-year-olds from the same area. They are telling me stories about how they are watching their lives before them when they watch a boyfriend or a stepfather because the family had broken apart, the mother remarried or whatever, and the person that she is with is a drug addict. This little child watches her mother get shot up and killed because of the drugs the boyfriend shoots into the mother. Can you imagine a 12- or 13-year-old having to live with this and see this happen in their home? What we are asking is simply for the Food and Drug Administration to change, to be the watchdog to help us. They are supposed to protect us. They don't say: I did my job. The pharmaceutical company told me they made this drug, and this is the way it was made. This is what it was supposed to do. We checked it out. Everything is fine; leave it on the market. You are not looking at the welfare of the people. You know what it does. You know it is addictive. We have no treatment centers. We are doing nothing to treat this. We are not challenging these pharmaceutical companies who are good companies. They do a lot of good and put a lot of products out there that are very good, but they are bringing these opiates on the market quicker than ever before, more powerful than ever before, and they know what is going to happen. I am challenging all of them. I think the FDA should challenge them. We are not going to approve more opiates. We are not going to let you bring on the market stronger opiates that we know are addictive and will ruin people's lives. If they will do that and challenge these companies to come out with new research and development that can scientifically give us relief needed for people who have chronic pain without making them addicts who lose their lives--we should be able to do that in this great country. I am going to read you a story from Kentucky, my next door neighbor, the majority leader's home--Kentucky and West Virginia. This is Emily from Louisville, KY. My name is Emily Walden. I am a mother who lost my 21-year- old son to a drug overdose in 2012. My son TJ came from a good family, was a member of the Kentucky National Guard and the most respectful young man you could have ever met. TJ made an initial poor decision that led to an addiction to the drug Opana; he had unlimited access to this drug during that time. TJ did not want to die from this. He tried very hard to overcome his addiction and I tried very hard to save his life. I started researching the drug Opana about five years ago and would like to share with you what I have learned that illustrates the need for changes to our FDA policies and approval processes for all opioid drugs. The drug Opana contains the opioid Oxymorphone which was removed from the market in 1979 due to the overdose deaths and addiction this drug was causing across our country. In 2002, the FDA started holding IMMPACT meetings every year allowing pharmaceutical companies to pay money to be included in discussions and changes to clinical trials, design. We call that pay to play--the impact it has because they are able to go to these types of settings and get absolute front row seats with the people they are trying to persuade to take another look at these drugs that might have been taken off the market because they were deemed too dangerous. This is allowed to go on. It has been going on for far too long, and the FDA is part of it. This is part of the change that needs to be made and made immediately. Endo Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Opana, attended each one of these ``pay-to-play'' meetings. In 2003, Endo Pharmaceuticals brought the drug Opana to the FDA for approval and was denied due to the overdoses that occurred during the clinical trials. In 2006, Endo Pharmaceuticals again brought the drug Opana to the FDA for approval but this time using new clinical trial that applied a modified process, called ``Enriched Enrollment,'' which removed patients with preexisting opiate sensitivities from the trial. The Enriched Enrollment process skews results and seriously underestimates risks associated with the proposed drug involved in the clinical trial. In addition, the FDA ignored their own review guidance by bypassing their advisory committee and approved Opana for moderate to severe pain. At the time Opana was approved, our country was already experiencing an explosion of overdose deaths and addiction from the overprescribing and misrepresentation of the safety of opiates. In addition to causing thousands of deaths and addiction, the approved use of Opana has now been directly implicated in an outbreak of Hepatitis C and HIV cases in the State of Indiana. The FDA has continued to use Enriched Enrollment-- Or pay to play-- to approve new opiates and override or bypass altogether their advisory committee for new opiate approvals and for new uses of opiates further contributing to the overdose deaths and addiction. These process changes must stop. The year after my son died I traveled to Washington DC for the first time in my life and was very fortunate to be able to meet with the then Senate Minority Leader-- Now Senate majority leader-- Senator McConnell, the next year I had nine meetings which included a meeting with then acting Director Botticelli of ONDCP, DEA Administrator Michelle Leonhart and seven meetings with Senator's staff. In 2015 I had thirteen meetings scheduled. I am not going away! We need change to curb this horrible epidemic that started with prescribed opiates and the mistakes that were made need to be corrected. How many people have to die? How many more people have to become addicted? The FDA is sending the wrong message to physicians by continuing to approve opioids during the worst drug epidemic our country has ever faced. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator's postcloture time has expired. Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous consent to continue. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Madam President. The FDA is supposed to be protecting public health and yet over 200,000 people have died and they have failed to put appropriate restrictions on these dangerous drugs to prevent overdose deaths. I want to know why there is one death from something such as ecoli and every head of lettuce is pulled from the shelves in ten different states but opioids have killed thousands of people and they are considered safe and effective? How can that be? When is the FDA going to put human life before the paychecks of Big Pharma? What will it take? A million deaths? We need an FDA commissioner that will protect the citizens of this country that is willing to take the overall best interest of public safety into consideration and not allow the pharmaceutical companies to have him in their back pockets. My son TJ had a lifelong dream of joining the military and fighting for his country. He would have given his life to protect and serve. He was one of the most patriotic young men and his country failed him. Please do the right thing. Please do not let one more mother get a knock on her door saying their child is gone and that they will never [ever] come home [again]. There is no greater pain than burying your child! My son, my precious child with the most beautiful blue eyes, caring and loving heart, died in part by the greed of big Pharma and-- Most importantly-- the carelessness of the FDA. It is time for change! Another story from Kentucky. This is in Northern Kentucky and this is Kimberly's story. My name is Kimberly Wright. I am a [mother from Northern Kentucky] who works in the trenches to save the lives of people in my Community. NKY was hit by a pill epidemic around 2000. That pill Epidemic has now turned into a Heroin Epidemic. Since 2013 the death toll continues to climb. In 2015 we have had 1,168 overdose reverses. We still await the number of deaths. Our entire system is on the verge of collapse--our Courts, Police, Children's Services, Jails. Our jails currently have 99% Heroin and Pill cases housed in the jails. Our Treatment system is seriously strained with not 1 new bed added in the last 10 years since this epidemic started. We are in a War in [Northern Kentucky]. Every day we wait to see how many died that day. We have people getting in their cars driving high on pills and Heroin wrecking into innocent people and killing them. This is the United States of America and this is a shame. We allow the FDA and Big Pharma to profit off the deaths of an entire generation of young people. We are in effect losing 2 jumbo jets full of kids every day [[Page S951]] in America due to Pills and Heroin. We need help. We are begging for help to stop this madness. Our American families are losing our children at an alarming rate to overprescribing Drs and Big Pharma. We beg you, please help us stop this. I lost my sister Alicia Cook on October 26, 2010, to an overdose. Alicia was a nurse with 2 young daughters. This Epidemic has no boundaries and it's in every community in the Country. Northern Kentucky has the highest rates of HEPC, surpassing the National Level, due to heroin and pills being injected. We have a high rate of homeless children due to their parents being dead or drug addicted with no end in sight. We have 52% of grandparents raising their grandchildren due to death and addiction. This is a nightmare for parents. When our children were born we could have never imagined this would be our life. You don't sleep at night from the anxiety of wondering if you are the next parent to get that call that your child has overdosed. It's like being in a constant panic attack. It's not normal to grieve the loss of a child who is alive, for they are truly lost. I [know lots of] parents who have lost their child and I can't imagine their pain and grief. I grieve for my addicted 26- year-old daughter who is in the fight of her life [because of] her Addiction. I watch her destroying herself every day. I don't want to join the mothers who have lost their child to this Epidemic. I know how I suffer now and I just can't go there. I will continue to fight for my community. Will you [please] join me? That is Arlene's story. Indiana is one of the States that has been hit so hard also. This is Danielle's story from Southern Indiana. My name is Danielle McCowan. I live in southern Indiana and work as a server. About 2 and a half years ago a customer by the name of Josh Harvey left me his number. At the time he told me he was living in Chicago for school. Little did I know he was in rehab there. Granted, I didn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in constant contact. Over a year or so ago I found out about his heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know it started out with prescription pills and later went to heroin when the pills became harder to get. He served a month in jail in Michigan for the entire month of this past July over a heroin related charge. He came home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. Luckily, his dad saved him that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient program doing better. Or so we all thought. School let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came to me on November the 4th telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. I suggested an in-patient program. He went to Wellstone after he left my house. He sat for several hours and finally was given a room. I went and checked on him 2 different times while he waited to make sure he was there. Thursday I didn't receive any calls. Friday nothing either. Then Saturday morning, the 7th of November, his mother called me to break my heart. He had passed away that Friday, the 6th, over in Louisville and didn't know who to contact until that Saturday morning, I guess. He had checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into his house, took his Xbox which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. Never in a million years did I think I'd become close to anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn't discriminate. It can get ahold of any and everybody. Never in my life have I been so depressed or heartbroken. All I want is his story shared. He was my happy ending gone away too soon. They continue. They continue on, these stories, the heartaches and the lives destroyed, lives changed. Few too many lives are saved. Massachusetts. As the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Markey has been working with me very closely and all of us on this horrible epidemic that we have. This is Sara's story. She is from Amherst, MA. My nuclear family is middle class or the working poor, but it is blended in that I was raised by my mother and step-dad, but my bio father's side of the family would be considered well-off. Heroin first came to my radar after my brother Donny became addicted to pain pills after surgery, and heroin followed suit after RX's stopped. Then it seemed like it was everywhere around me: my nephew, my niece. Then we lost my cousin Cory, who passed in a sober house for his addiction to alcohol, along with a needle and an empty bag next to him. Cory is an example of a young man institutionalized by multiple incarcerations and just when he would try to lift himself up, in he would go again. He was trying to get clean for his girlfriend and unborn child when he passed away, and he was happy, thinking he was getting better. Living with someone close who struggles and then multiply that by two, and adolescence, young adulthood mixed in, and you have my descent as an empathetic aunt who felt powerless to change anything. Then the bottom dropped out. My cousin, John Ahern, passed at the end of August after a long period of recovery alone in the woods. It didn't matter he came from privilege or was the nicest person I had every known in my life for so long. He leaves behind three loving sons. They both couldn't access the help they needed at various stages, including recovery, and died alone. It is my mission to stand up for them and the young people like my niece who began her struggle at 14, and now approaching 18 has some clean time. There are no support programs in my community for this age group, and especially for non-White young people like my niece and nephew. They are both of Latino descent. Please do something. People are begging us everywhere in this country to help them, and basically it starts with treating this as an illness and not as a crime. It starts also with having clinics, having basic places where we can serve them and help them get clean. They cannot do it by themselves, and they are the first to tell you. The stories I am reading here exemplify that so well. I have a Florida story here, and Florida has also been ravaged. Florida was a problem that we had in West Virginia because of the pill mills there. People would take the bus down or they could take a cheap flight down to Florida, buy all the pills they could and come back. Florida has been very helpful in the last years trying to stop the pill epidemic. This is Janet from Fort Lauderdale. Dear Senator Manchin. I appreciate you taking the time to stop the appointment of Dr. Califf from becoming the FDA commissioner. I founded STOPPnow--Stop the Organized Pill Pushers now--due to all the drug-addicted babies I was caring for as a neonatal intensive care nurse at a children's hospital in Broward County, FL. We started holding protests in front of the 150 pill mills that were in Broward County alone. Many parents came out to protest with us. Parents from all over the country contacted us as well. Too many parents are crying themselves to sleep over the loss of their child. At first, there were no consequences for either the clinic owner or the doctor. Then they started arresting the doctors for money laundering. Our State's attorney has called the doctors drug dealers in white coats. The Board of Medicine is not protecting the public by allowing high-prescribing doctors to keep their license. Therefore, the plight of the drug-addicted babies and the devastation to the families continues to rise. When one clinic owner was arrested, he was earning $150,000 a day. I repeat, $150,000 a day. Not one doctor in that clinic to date has lost his license or his practice. We only have the judicial system helping to alleviate this in Florida. Doctors are now being charged with first-degree murder. It would be kinder for a doctor to lose his license than to sit in a courtroom at their own murder trial. We have been unsuccessful in our efforts for lawmakers to mandate that prescribers use the prescription drug monitoring program in Florida. Yet in this environment, there is a bill passing through the committees allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe narcotics without a doctor signing off on the order. I would support this bill if they included the mandate. And, of course, the FDA approved that children as young as 11 years old can be prescribed OxyContin. We definitely need an investigation. Madam President, as you can see, these are problems that we have all over the country. This is not just your State and not just my State. I know it is hard. They say we need someone in there, so let's just go ahead and confirm Dr. Califf. Dr. Califf is an honorable man. He is still there. He is going to be there. He has been there for 1 year. In the 1 year that he has been there, we have basically put more opiate drugs on the market without even going through a clinical overview. If that change were going to come, it would have come by now. I am sure he could have had input, and I would hope that he would. Dr. Califf has called a lot of our colleagues and said that these changes will be coming. This Senator will tell you the changes they recommended when they said they were going to make changes. They said: We are going to make sure that we are going to start listening to our staff and people who are reviewing these drugs. They are going to listen to them, but there is no mandate that they will have to follow. This Senator has a piece of legislation that the Presiding Officer coauthored, and I appreciate that very much. Basically what we are saying is this: When you have your advisory committee--and every drug must go through an advisory committee's opinion, and if they recommend as they did with Zohydro to not let it go on the market, that cannot be bypassed, neglected, or pushed aside. Our bill would basically state that they must bring it to the people's representatives in Congress and state why it is so very important for them to bring this new high- powered drug to the market--as if we don't have enough. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population but consumes 80 [[Page S952]] percent of these addictive opiate drugs. Something is wrong. Something must change. I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to be able to read the letters of people who have been affected by this all over this great country in all of our States. I know we feel the pain, and we are going to try to make these changes and make sure this agency will do what it is supposed to do. I yield the floor. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S943-S952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUANTANAMO DETAINEES Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about President Obama's plan to move Guantanamo Bay terrorists to the United States. However, it is not much of a plan. With all due respect, it is more of a failed attempt to fulfill a campaign promise and, in my view, what he believes will secure his legacy. Fortunately for us--those who believe that moving dangerous enemy combatants within our communities is dangerous, irresponsible, and an illogical idea--the President's plan contains nothing really substantive. In fact, it fails to recommend an alternative location to any current facility at all. As a matter of fact, I call that a win. The plan does not provide any intelligence to substantiate the President's claims, nor does it even provide a chart or a graph to support the mathematics on the alleged cost savings, and there is no estimate regarding the cost to [[Page S944]] local and State governments to support such a move. Indeed, the 9-page report is short in every regard. The White House received the Department of Defense's results of their site surveys and other data regarding a potential closing last month. And this--I am holding up the report here--this is all we have in return: 9 pages. I know the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, my good friend and colleague, Senator John McCain, is not going to be pleased with the lack of substance or data or the articulation of a real plan. The same goes for Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who at this particular time is going to be introducing legislation of his own to provide intelligence with regard to the administration's lack of intelligence on moving detainees to the United States. The lack of a plan and the inability of this administration to provide an alternative site indicate that none of the sites visited by DOD's survey team met the demands necessary to hold detainees and, more important, keep our community safe. The fact that no site was named and no substance on those visits was provided tells me there is no alternative to match what we are now doing safely and securely at Gitmo, period. This so-called plan, as outlined by the President in his speech today from the White House, skims over four steps to closing Guantanamo Bay. First, it articulates the administration's plan to continue moving detainees designated for transfer by the President's national security team to foreign countries. In some instances, this may have been successful with regard to individuals being rehabilitated, but a third of the time, detainees transferred to third-party host countries have returned to the battlefield. And these are just the ones we know about. This is called recidivism, and the rates are too high for this process to be called ``secure and responsible,'' as the administration has labeled it. Second, the administration plans to continue its review of the threat posed by those detainees who are not currently eligible for transfer through the Periodic Review Board. This is to provide a new review on the current population of detainees who have been deemed too dangerous to transfer--deemed too dangerous to transfer, and yet this President wants to give them a second shot at getting out. This doesn't make any sense. Terrorists are not criminals. As much as this President would like for you to believe they are, terrorists are not equal to the inmates we have across America's prison system. They are fixated on the destruction of America. They have no regard for life, not that of their own and especially not the lives of innocent civilians. The report hones in on having a detainee population anywhere from 30 to 60. There seems to be an assumption on the part of the President that the review board will determine that half of those deemed too dangerous for transfer or release are suddenly safe for transfer or release. Does the President believe this is possible or does this assumption simply serve his own means to create cost savings for his plan that can never be realized? The plan also fails to account for the fact that our Nation is still mired in the War on Terrorism. We are still fighting in the Middle East and worldwide, including the United States of America, to ensure that terrorism does not prevail. What about the individuals we detain from this day forward? What about those individuals with critical information related to the next terrorist threat? How can we operate without a facility like Guantanamo Bay to hold terrorists we take off the battlefield? Third, the plan attempts to identify individual dispositions, one by one, for those who remain designated for continued law of war detention, to include Article III, military commissions, or foreign prosecutions. What a muddle. In his remarks today, President Obama advocated for trying terrorist suspects in Article III courts. The President named two American citizens--Faisal Shahzad and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev--to articulate his point. Both of those individuals, however, were apprehended in the United States, not on the battlefield. The intent of the Guantanamo detention facility is to protect the American people by removing terrorists from the battlefield. As the United States faces a growing threat from terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, which have tens of thousands of members, bringing those terrorists to the United States to stand trial simply cannot be the answer. It is not safe for the American people and irresponsible to our national security. Fourth, the plan states the administration's desire to ``work with Congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' That is in quotes, ``work with Congress.'' Well, there is something that is unique with the President, ``work with Congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' But it does not anywhere in its nine pages endorse a specific facility to house Guantanamo detainees; rather, the plan describes a prototype for a detention facility in the United States--not Kansas, not Colorado, not South Carolina, not anywhere in the United States. The President's long-awaited plan is to work with Congress to identify the most appropriate location as soon as possible, according to the summary provided to my office by the Department of Defense. Question: How could it take 7 years to arrive at the idea to work with Congress? What a novel idea, but only for this express purpose. If the President had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in this plan. If he had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in 2009 when we stopped his plan the first time. Further, the plan fails to substantiate President Obama's repeated claims that Guantanamo Bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists. Let me repeat this. The plan fails to substantiate President Obama's repeated claims that Guantanamo Bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists, a rallying point for terrorist attacks, hindering relations with allies, and draining Department of Defense resources. My goodness. I wrote Defense Secretary Ash Carter in November to ask for intelligence reports or data to support many of these assertions. I asked Secretary Carter if an intelligence assessment has been done in conjunction with the site surveys recently conducted by the Department of Defense from the safety of our community's standpoint. I asked for the Department's rationale for evaluating Fort Leavenworth, when three previous evaluations have made it abundantly clear it is and continues to be an unacceptable alternative. I asked if there were intelligence products regarding previous site evaluations at Fort Leavenworth. The administration has argued that Guantanamo is a recruiting tool for terrorists. So I logically asked for an intelligence assessment to support that argument. As a follow on, I asked what assessment had been done to reflect that Guantanamo has increased terrorist recruitment. And finally, was there any empirical data to support the administration's argument that national security threats will decrease if enemy combatants are held in the United States? Common sense will tell you that it would increase. Two months later, the response confirmed my assumptions. The Department of Defense had no intelligence products--none. There were no intelligence products, no data to provide to support the President's argument that GTMO serves as a recruiting tool and that moving detainees to the mainland would increase security and decrease the terrorist threat to the United States. My colleagues, this plan really confirms what many of us already know: There is no safe alternative to GTMO--not in Kansas, not in Colorado, not in South Carolina. Nowhere on the mainland is there a secure and responsible alternative. If there were, this President would not have failed to articulate it in his plan. Mr. President, a plan that is a legacy speech does not safeguard the lives of the American people. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on the nomination. Mr. MANCHIN. I wish to speak on the nomination of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Robert Califf. [[Page S945]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I believe the FDA needs new leadership, a new focus and a new culture, and Dr. Robert Califf's past involvement with the pharmaceutical industry reflects that he will not be this person. He will not have the impact or leadership capabilities the Nation needs to stem the tide of the opioid crisis we have all over this country, even in your great State of Oklahoma and my State of West Virginia, which has been ravaged by this. I would like to put this in context for a little bit. He has been there over a year--a good man. I am not speaking about his ability, his honesty, his integrity, his education, his background, and all the good work he has done. But he has been there for a year, and for the past 20 years Dr. Califf basically has come from the institutional research side, from education, and with that, his support has come from the pharmaceutical industries, those that are putting opioids on the market. I just feel it would be hard, human naturewise, for him to change and rule to keep these products from coming onto the market. So to put this in context, this is not personally about Dr. Califf. This is about the culture he comes from and the year he has been there as the No. 2 man and what has happened during that period of time. Let me go over some things. Over the last decade, the FDA has approved new drugs at historically high rates. In 2008, companies filing applications to sell never-before-marketed drugs were denied 66 percent of the time. They were denied 66 percent of the time. Yet between the beginning of 2015 and August of 2015, the FDA rejected only 3 uses for new chemical entities and approved 25. That is an approval rate of 89 percent. Now, tell me how in 7 short years that culture changed to where anything and everything coming at us was passed through, when we have already become the most addicted country on Earth. If one looks at new drugs and not the use of drugs, they have rejected only 1 and approved 23. That is a 96-percent approval rate in 2015. So of the new drugs that came to the market, only 1 was rejected--a 96-percent approval rate. In 2008, the FDA's approval of new marketing claims for existing drugs was 56 percent. In the first 8 months of 2015, it was 88 percent. This includes approving OxyContin for children as young as 11. The FDA's 2013 approval of Zohydro drew widespread concern. All of us were outraged when we heard this new drug came on the market. To put another time period in context, I had worked for 3 years to try to get all opioids from a schedule III to a schedule II so doctors could prescribe only for 30 days. You had to go back and see your doctor. Up until that time, Vicodin and Lortab--the two most widely prescribed opioids--were schedule III. That means you could get a 90- day prescription and then call in to get it refilled. They were going out like M&Ms. We were able to do that, and no sooner did we get that done--and it took 3 years, when it should have been 3 weeks. Within the same week that all opioids got to us from a schedule III to a schedule II, they approved a new drug called Zohydro, which was 10 times more powerful than Vicodin or Lortab--much more powerful. That approval was done against their advisory committee 11 to 2. That means 13 experts evaluated this drug and said: It is not needed, too powerful, don't do it. Guess what, they did it anyway. Now they are saying that they are not going to pay attention to the advisory committee. Not only did they say they are not going to pay attention to the advisory committee, but we have had the decision on OxyContin being given to 11-year-old children; we have had the two new drugs that came out in 2014 after Zohydro and the pushback from Senators representing our respective States; they had a new drug called Targiniq, which is an extended-release OxyContin product, and Hysingla, which is an extended-release hydrocodone product. So there were three new decisions made, with two new powerful opioids coming to the market and the decision that OxyContin would be given to 11-year-olds. That was done without any review from the advisory committee. They got so much pushback from Zohydro, they said: We are not going down this path again. We will just not have anybody review it. We will just go ahead and do it. If you believe that is a culture that will protect the welfare and well-being of our citizens in our States all through this great country of ours, then I am sorry because I don't. I am sorry, but that is why I have been so passionate. I have more people dying of legal prescription drug abuse than anything else in the State of West Virginia. More people die. It is ravaging families. I have personal letters I will read, and they will tear your heart out with what is happening and how this grips and tears people apart. It tears communities apart. Every law enforcement agency in America will tell you--no matter what town they are in, what county they are in, or what State they are in--that over 80 percent and upward of 95 percent of all crimes committed are drug related, are some sort of drug related. There is not one of us right now in this beautiful Senate Chamber that doesn't know somebody in our immediate family or Senate family that hasn't been affected by drugs, either prescription legal drugs or illegal drugs. It is awful. It is an epidemic. I believe the FDA must break its cozy relationship with the pharmaceutical industry and instead start a relationship with the millions of Americans. I have said that I am going to fight against the FDA protecting a business plan and hopefully the culture will change, and they will start protecting America and the plan of families and citizens of this great country to have a healthy lifestyle. It is because of this belief that I am urging my colleagues to vote against the confirmation of Dr. Robert Califf as the director of the Food and Drug Administration. He will still be there and still be a valuable person. He is just not that person with the passion to change the culture in this important agency. We have let this sleeping giant go for far too long. My office has been absolutely flooded, Mr. President, with stories from West Virginians--but I have received them from all over the country--who want their voices to be heard. They say: Please use my name. I am not ashamed. We have been hiding too long. I have watched too many people's lives be destroyed. So today I will read letters not only from West Virginians but also people across this great country of ours that have been impacted by the opioid abuse epidemic. I urge my colleagues to listen to these letters from their States and stories from my State about these drugs before confirming Dr. Califf, and in all good conscience make that decision tomorrow when we vote. Do you really believe he can bring the changes needed and not just say: Well, we have to have somebody there. He is already there. He will do a good job where he is; he is just not going to be able to kick them and shake them up and say we are not going down this path any more. There are some good people. We have made some recommendations of some good people who would bring the cultural changes that need to be brought. I am going to read first about a young lady from Southern West Virginia. Her name is Chelsea. This is her story. As a recovering addict, I have watched myself, my friends, and loved ones suffer from this horrible thing we call addiction. As I watch all these people now suffering, I know they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, and neither did I. Whether it be for pain or just simply hanging with the wrong people like I did, we all have one thing in common, we chose to do drugs for the first time. Someone made a decision to do drugs for the first time. Growing up, I can honestly say I had what most people would call a normal childhood. Chelsea comes from an upper socioeconomic family in Southern West Virginia. She continues: I was raised by two hardworking parents who would and will still do anything for me. I was a gymnast and a cheerleader for most of my life and went to church every Wednesday and Sunday. My dad was even the Mayor of Madison at one point. But even being raised up in a good home did not stop me from doing drugs. So this has no socioeconomic bearing. It does not. It is not a partisan issue. Whether you are a Democrat or [[Page S946]] Republican, it makes no difference. Rich or poor makes no difference. Chelsea continues: I can still remember the first time I heard about someone getting high. I was in the 6th grade and became friends with a girl whose parents got high themselves. We would walk about the playground and she would talk of these things called ``drugs.'' As she talked day in and day out about how getting high made her feel, it made me start to wonder what this thing called ``getting high'' was really about. Now, mind you, I am talking about a 12-year-old girl. She was just 12 years old. I can remember thinking how cool I thought it was that her parents had done drugs with her and would party with her. So another friend of hers, also 12 years old, had parents who were doing drugs with her and would party with her. Chelsea continues: One weekend I went to her house to stay the night and this was the first time I had gotten high. We smoked some pot, drank some alcohol, and I was turned on to my first pill around the age of 12. From this day forward, my life would forever be changed. From the ages twelve to fifteen I partied some on the weekends and sometimes during the week, but as time went on my addiction and tolerance grew more and more. By this time, I was doing more pills because I had access to them. Between stealing Lortabs off my dad, to hanging with that girl so we could get high with her dad, to buying pills off the local drug dealer on the street, I had moved from doing them every now and then to every day. I would stay a lot of weekends at this girl's house just to get high because my parents would never have done that nor did they know I was doing it. By sixteen my life took another turn. My grandmother, who I called Nana, had taken care of me most of my life while my mother worked. She was diagnosed with lung cancer two years prior. In the last days of her life, I would visit her in the hospital and she would tell me how proud she was of me and how I was her little model. I had also met a very special guy by the name of J.R. a few months before this who I spent a lot of time with. On July 18, 2003, my Nana passed away. On the day of her wake, J.R. took me out to dinner, and on the way home he asked me to go meet his dad. I explained to him I could not and that my grandma's funeral was the next day. He dropped me off that night, kissed me good-bye, and that was the last time I ever heard from J.R. Twenty minutes after he left me, he wrecked and died. I felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. The day of his funeral is the next time I met the love of my life that would soon try to destroy my life. It was called OxyContin. I fell in love immediately with OxyContin. It took all of my cares and worries away, and from that moment on all I wanted to do was be numb. As the years passed, my drug addiction grew worse. I was not only doing pain pills, I was now experimenting with all kinds of other things. I can still remember my senior week in high school. While everyone was excited about going to the beach, I had to make sure I had enough drugs to go and not be sick. I took Roxy's and Oxy's, pretty much anything I could get my hands on, and eight balls of cocaine. By this time in my life I didn't care about anything. It never once had crossed my mind that if I got caught with all of that I could go to jail. I was just worried about my next high. The following months were the same. I was doing anything I could to get my hands on drugs, from pain pills to cocaine to meth. I did not care as long as I was high. I was hanging around with people who were as sick as I was and places that I look back now that I would not even take my dog. At 19 I met a guy who would fuel my drug addiction even more. He was 40 years old and dealt OxyContin. At this point I could not afford my habit, so I did what I had to do. I started seeing my drug dealer. My life soon went from bad to worse. I had OxyContin 80s any time I wanted them, and at the time I thought life can't get any better than this. When you are doing eight to ten OxyContin 80s a day, you will do whatever it takes to get them. At this point I was turned on to heroin. Heroin would have taken my life if it hadn't scared me so much. The high from heroin is so intense that anyone who had done it would have fallen in love. But, actually, it scared the life out of me. As time passed and I wasn't getting high like I wanted to anymore from snorting OxyContin, I decided to start shooting up. That is one thing I never thought I would do is shoot up. I always told myself that people who shot up were the homeless people on the streets, complete and utter trash. Now here I was sticking a needle in my arm to get what I wanted. And to be honest, I thought life was bad before. It just got a whole lot worse. The life I was and the life that I knew was gone, and OxyContin was completely ruling my life now. OxyContin is a legal drug made by a legal pharmaceutical that knew exactly the effects this would have when they put this on the market over 20 years ago. She said: What stood before everyone was pure addiction. I had started stealing off of everyone by now and didn't care who I hurt. People's priceless possessions that meant so much to them meant nothing to me. All I'd seen was my next fix. That's all I could see. People were bringing me stolen stuff and I was taking it to the nearest pawn shop or my drug dealer. I had no shame. I had needle marks all up and down my arms, and I would lie to my family about how they got there. It was like I had no conscience, or, better yet, my addiction was my conscience. Eventually I got caught stealing and was charged with 17 different felonies and one misdemeanor. This still did not slow me down even though I was looking at two to 20 years in prison. Nothing scared me more than being sick from the drugs. On September 29, 2008, I was called in for a random drug test and failed because I had shot up OxyContin the day before. At the courthouse they handcuffed me and shackled me and sent me to Southwestern Regional Jail where I did a total of 10 days. As I sat there in that jail cell and cried, I thought a pill could not be worth two to 20 years of my life, and I hit my knees and prayed to God that if He brought me out of that jail cell, that I would never, ever, ever touch drugs again. The Lord answered my prayer and the judge gave me the choice to stay in jail or go to the Life Center of Galax, in Galax, Virginia. I chose to go to rehab. I completed the 30-day program and came back and did Thomas Memorial's intense outpatient program for 6 more weeks. Once I got home I was sentenced to two to 20 years, but they suspended my sentence. I went through drug court and completed it. I was the third person to ever graduate from the Lincoln County Drug Court. I also had to do 14 more days in jail, 6 months of home confinement, and 4 years' probation. I can honestly say that going to jail and rehab saved my life. If I hadn't have been put in jail, I would probably be 6 feet in the ground just like a lot of my friends that I had to bury. All of these things combined gave me something I hold very dear to my heart. My recovery. Recovery has not only given my life back. It has given me a chance to be a daughter, a sister, a wife, and hopefully a mother someday, a productive member of society, a good friend, but most of all, my recovery has given me a chance to be the voice of the sick and suffering addicts who lay in bed at night wondering if there is a way out. I enjoy giving people hope and showing them that treatment does work. I am living proof that if you work the program of recovery, it will work for you. Since that day I had found myself sitting in that jail cell with no hope and my life completely consumed by my addiction, my life has changed for the better. I have graduated with an Associate's Degree in applied science from Southern West Virginia Community Technical College. I went on to get my Bachelor's degree in the arts of psychology from West Virginia State University, and now I am currently working on my Masters of Social Work degree at Concord University, and I will graduate with that degree in May. I have also been able to go to various schools, drug courts, and different places around the state to tell my story of addiction from where I was then to where I am now. I have also had the pleasure of working with a great group of people who are trying to get a sober living home open in Danville, West Virginia called the Hero House. I can tell you, she is so passionate about getting this Hero House so she can help other people. Anybody listening who wants to help Chelsea in Danville, WV, with the Hero House, please do so or contact my office. Now, with all this being said, I don't tell my story to get praise. I tell my story because there is a son, a daughter, a husband, a father, a wife, and many, many other people out there addicted to drugs and they do not see a light at the end of the tunnel. When you are in active addiction, that light is so dim and a lot of times people think they are going to die from this horrible disease. But I am here to show people that you don't have to die. You don't have to let that horrible addiction win. You can step out and take your life back, because I am here to tell you that if you don't, if you don't, your addiction is going to take you to your grave. Drugs do not discriminate. They know no good, no bad, no rich, no poor. There are so many people out there who suffer from this because there is little to no treatment. By the grace of God I was sent to rehab and given a second chance. I still have the horrible reminders every day of the things I did to my family, to my body, and, most of all, to my self-esteem. I have the track marks after being 7 years sober that constantly remind me of the life I once lived. I have a poor self-image because of the men I chose to give myself to just to get a pill, and the damage I did to my family because I had no cares in the world. One day I hope there is enough treatment to help the addicts who want help. People need to be given a second chance and shown there is a better way of life than to do drugs. [[Page S947]] I have another story called Tami's story, but I know Chelsea. I know this girl. She is impressive. She said: Please tell my story, I want people to know. No one could come from a finer family than I came from. No one can go lower than I have gone, and no one but by the grace of God could be saved like I was. When we hear these stories--and all she is saying is there is no treatment. She was lucky. She found a treatment center. Somehow we have to come to grips with this. We have a tax on tobacco because we know it is harmful and we have to cure people of the disease. We have a tax on alcohol. We have no fee whatsoever on opiates--none--and it is destroying lives like nothing else that has ever happened in this country. We need to make people conscious of this, and we need to have an FDA that is compassionate, but not only that, is committed to the change that needs to be made in our culture. I want to read Tami's story, from West Virginia. That is in the northern panhandle. Chelsea was way down in the southern part of our State of West Virginia. We have 2 adult children suffering from substance use disorder. Our son entered the military while in college. He was sent to Iraq right after 9/11, December 27, 2001. He experienced things that he never talked about, celebrated his 21st birthday there, and returned home. He was not a saint when he went to war. He had a juvenile past of drinking. Back then we thought he was a typical teenager acting out. When he returned, he suffered PTSD, as many do, and went to the VA hospital for treatment. He was put on cocktail after cocktail of medications. We all know this. We all know that basically these brave men and women who are willing to risk their lives and sacrifice their lives for us--in order to treat their pain, we think, just give them a prescription, and they are able to get anything and everything. That is what they are talking about when he was put on cocktail after cocktail of medications--was this his starting point of the spiral into addiction? I believe his addiction to opioids, benzoids, and amphetamines started then. I know that he spiraled from that point on. He lost his marriage, he didn't see his son, he bounced from drugs to drugs to drugs. He obtained several DUIs, and time after time he walked away, no offer of help, no sentencing. He bounced, married again. She was addicted to heroin. He bounced again, was in and out of our house. Unfortunately, we always gave him a safe place to land. She said: ``Unfortunately,''--not fortunately but unfortunately--``we always gave him a safe place to land.'' The last time I saw him is when I called the police on him. I discovered that him and his girlfriend, with two small children, who had been living in our house for four months were using and selling drugs. I found out he was recently incarcerated for drug traffic and sent to a correctional rehabilitation facility. Our daughter was an athlete all through school. She received injury after injury, and at 18 started seeing specialists for back pain. That was in 2004. They prescribed opiates. I never saw the addiction coming. She lost her best friend since first grade that year to a drunk driving accident. She went to counseling. More prescriptions. She appeared fine, gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, and then because of back pain more pain prescriptions were given. I realized she had a problem when she was pregnant with her second child and was stepped down to Vicodin while pregnant. Vicodin while pregnant. After his birth, we started her first rehab experience. She returned to the father of her children sober. She relapsed and began snorting heroin. At this time she was living in Ohio and we were unaware of her relapse. We found out when her mother-in-law went to court and took her children. That was one of the worst days of all of our lives. We immediately picked her up, brought her back to West Virginia, and into treatment. Fast forward. Thousands of dollars later on attorneys, doctors, rehab, she returns to Ohio to try to obtain her children. Relapsed. She began shooting heroin and then arrested. We let her sit in jail and picked her up on her release. Charges were dismissed. Back to West Virginia she comes, hospitalized for a week and rehab again. She has now been in recovery for 13 months. She fell in love with a nice, drug-free man, moved to Ohio to try to obtain custody of her children back, and is six months pregnant. One thing I can say is my daughter was always a good mother. Even while on active addiction, she worked and took care of them. As you can tell, both of our children became addicted to prescription drugs first. . . And they tell me this is exactly how it starts. It starts at a very young age. Recreational marijuana, prescription drugs out of your parents' medicine cabinet, taking it to school, being the cool kid in school, sharing those drugs, then you begin using them, then you sell them. This is how it starts, and it leads to obtaining street drugs to feed their addiction. So it goes from occasional to recreational to addiction to feeding that addiction. This is a condensed version of course. As with any family dealing with addiction, it does not show the tears, the hurt, the financial breakdown put on the family; (we are broke). Literally and figuratively. She says: I want to thank you for listening. Doctors keep prescribing pills, and they will tell you that they have had very little training in this area. As they go through all of their medical schools and advanced training, they get very little training on the effects these drugs have on human beings and the addiction. We took 1 billion pills off the market when we went from 90 days to 30 days of Vicodin and Lortab. We took that many pills off the market. That means 30 days. I have people in my office or in their families--and I know the Presiding Officer does as well--who will go to the doctor for something where they may need pain relief for 1 or 2 days. Do you know what they get? They automatically get enough pills for 30 days. That is the path of least resistance. It is legal, they can do it, and the doctor will write a 30-day prescription. We are working on a bill that will be coming to the floor. We need to make a lot of changes to that bill, but most importantly, we need to make sure we have an agency in the Federal Government of the United States of America that is fighting to protect every American. And it is not a business plan that we have to adhere to, not at all. These are good companies. They are legal pharmaceutical companies. They do an awful lot of good. I challenge every one of them that is listening to what we are talking about right now to give us pain relief without addiction to opioids. Do something. Break through the chemistry or something. It has to be there. We have been able to solve every other epidemic. We have been able to cure epidemics and pandemics, and now we have one that has been ravaging our country for almost 30 years. I have Samantha's story. She says: Hello. My name is Samantha Holbrooke. She wants you to know her name. I am from Fayette County, WV. I am a 28-year-old female. I have been an addict for the past 6 years. This letter is to explain to you how addiction has affected my life. It is also to express my view on drugs and what it is doing to our society. I first started drugs when I was 13 years old. I was a recreational marijuana user. My mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict. My father was not in the home or involved in my life. Unfortunately, that is true for many people around this country. My mother would allow me to drink with her and go to bars. I was often her designated driver, but I was only 13 years old. I got in my first and only bar fight at 13. It was with a 24-year-old woman. She thought I was coming on to her boyfriend. In reality, we were smoking weed, not trying to hook up. When I was 19, my oldest sister and mother introduced me to hydrocodone, Ritalin, Xanax, and Percocet. My sister and mother had no income; I did. By getting me on pills, they were able to get free pills by charging me to get them for them. By the time I was 22, I think I was snorting Oxycodone. Oxycodone is made in a single source, which is a powder form that is compressed. They would break it down, crush it, and snort it to get the quicker high. That became my drug of choice. I eventually got in with a doctor who was pretty much a pill mill. We know we have them all over this country. He wrote me a prescription for Xanax and Oxycodone. I got even more strung out on those two. As a result of using drugs, I now have memory problems, concentration problems, and the list goes on and on. I lost about 30 pounds. I lost my job. I lost my home. I lost my child. I lost my fiance to suicide. He was drunk when he shot himself in the head. I believe that had he not been drinking, he wouldn't have taken his own life. As a result of these life-changing events, I became severely depressed. I then took the wrong road and began to use drugs intravenously. I started lying and stealing. This led me to gain two felony charges and several other misdemeanors. I went to jail and prison and spent 2\1/2\ years locked up. I am now on DRC because I am on parole and had a relapse, which led to several bad decisions, and now I am paying the consequences. I am now in recovery. I am a recovering addict. I joined Narcotics Anonymous and [[Page S948]] Alcoholics Anonymous. The classes and programming in prison helped me to think better. I now analyze a situation before making a decision. This is my story. Prescription drugs and all drugs have ruined a large percentage of the citizens of West Virginia's lives. I am now in full control of my life again, thank the Lord. This story is anonymous, but they wanted to share it with us. I grew up in a nice home. My grandfather was a pastor. My dad grew up in church. My family went to church every Sunday. We had a nice house. We had nice cars. My mom didn't have to work, and my dad took very good care of us. My dad had surgery, a common surgery to remove several large veins in his legs. This is where his addiction began. This is where he found his unlimited supply of numbness. I was in middle school, and this is when I remember things being different. Things were changing. My dad stayed out with his friends a lot. He wasn't home for dinner anymore. When he was home, he was lying down sleepy and always said silly things. I would stay up late at night until he would get home, only to hear my mom and dad fighting, screaming, and my mom crying. Eventually I hated to hear the garage door open because I didn't want him to come home. Before my dad would take me to school, standing in his business suit with his briefcase, he would scarf down pills out of a little orange bottle. He would tip it back like he was eating a box of Nerds. I didn't know any better. My naive, my innocent mind didn't know what was happening. I couldn't comprehend that a doctor could be his drug dealer! They couldn't comprehend that because we have been taught to trust doctors. Things got worse. I started finding bottles of liquor and cans of beer hidden, and I passed it off. The 3 empty beers in the back of his company car: Oh, they must be his ``friends''. No one in our family drinks, definitely not my dad. I remember whole vacations, weekend trips, and afternoons ruined by his addiction. Mad fits of rage until one day my mom stood up and couldn't take it anymore. My dad got the help he needed, but how did he get the help? In hiding, in private--a local rehab facility. He was on a business trip. Our culture has stigmatized a group of people--a group of people who transcend race, status, gender--at the expense of their lives. This is a hidden killer. Drug abuse and drug addiction are hidden killers. So many of us have people in our families or close friends who don't want to talk about it. They are ashamed, and so it gets covered up and hidden away. As a result, we don't bring people out, let them know the effects, and cure them. She says: My dad was hurting. No, not from the wounds on his legs when he had his surgery but from depression and bipolar disorder. These are the roots of his addiction. They go hand in hand. When will we see this? When will we stop seeing addicts as a problem and see them as human beings and hurting? For the last 20 to 30 years, I have been in public life, and the Presiding Officer has been in public life a good bit. I always thought that anybody who fools with drugs is a criminal and should be put in jail. We have done that, and it hasn't solved a thing. It has gotten a lot worse. We have to rethink this issue. This is not a crime. Addiction is basically an illness. It needs to have a cure, and treatment is that cure. We have to face that. Senate Republicans and Democrats are looking at how to fix the sentencing guidelines, and I think it is encouraging and healthy for us to have these discussions. She says: Is it a selfish sickness? Of course it is. But how can we help them see the light when we push them aside? Because ``they asked for it?'' Just like a lady with skin cancer ``asked for it'' because she laid in a tanning bed? What if we treated addicts with the same compassion that we treat cancer patients? My father has been clean for almost a decade, and the demons of his addiction still haunt us all. No, we weren't homeless, nor did we have to face a death to be completely broken by this horrible epidemic, but I had a zombie for a father for my adolescence. I missed my childhood, years that we can never get back, memories that will never be erased, all because of a little orange pill bottle chased and hidden with a brown paper bag. Luckily, my story ends with a happy ending. I still have my dad. My story hasn't ended up the way so many do every day, like my two friends who didn't get help in time and passed away. I have stories from all over the country, and they are pathetic. I have a couple more I can read from West Virginia. I will go to different States. This is Erica's story. She says: Hello, My name is Erica and I am an addict. And I say that with great pride as I celebrated 10 years of recovery in November of 2015. I began using drugs here in West Virginia at the ripe age of 13. Thirteen seems to be that magic--adolescence. We are coming into adolescence. We are willing to experiment. We think we are invincible. We think nothing can harm us. Prescription drugs were easily accessible at that age and opened the door to 11 years of anguish, desperation, jails, and dirty needles. I came from a stable, drug- and alcohol- free home, but I was able to gain access to prescription drugs from my peers and my local middle school and high school on a daily basis. As my disease progressed, I dropped out of high school my freshman year and continued to put myself and family through years of pain and suffering. I attempted drug replacement therapy to control my opioid addiction, but that was only a temporary solution, and I eventually returned to drugs. Finally, I found myself in the court system and facing felony drug charges. It was then that I was able to find freedom through a 12-step fellowship. Today I can say I am a cum laude graduate of Marshall University, fully employed, homeowner, wife, and the mother of two wonderful West Virginia boys. I pray my children don't follow the path that, not only myself, but many of my West Virginians fall into. The disease of addiction is progressive and fatal if not treated or prevented. Here in West Virginia, we are leading the Nation in drug overdoses. And where I live in Cabell County, we have had over 900 overdoses in just the year of 2015. As a mother, I must trust our leaders to make responsible choices to help us seek solutions, gain back our communities, and save our children from following the same deadly path. I know the FDA was so proud that they came out with some new guidelines, and they said now they are going to start paying attention to the advisory committees. They didn't say they would adhere to their recommendations; they would just start paying attention to them. Also, the CDC--the Centers for Disease Control--put out some guidelines of how we should be prescribing, the knowledge we should have, how we should be administering, and what we should be doing to curb this drug abuse. And guess which agency fought against that and put it on delay? The FDA. The only thing I ask all of my colleagues to do is to please consider--just send a message with the vote you make tomorrow. It is not about the doctor at all. It is not about the person before us. It is about getting an advocate who will make a real change and make sure we fight this war. This story is another anonymous story: My brother is in his early 20s and was hired at the local plant that employs the majority of the county. He was injured on the job, saw his doctor, and was prescribed Lortab long term. Lortab, as I said before, is a schedule III, 90 days. You can keep calling it in, calling it in, and calling it in. As the effects from this started to wane, he was prescribed Xanax, Klonopin, and a variety of other prescription medicines. He then lost his good-paying job but found other work at a lower pay after almost a year of unemployment. This prescription med addiction continued for years, and once laws finally cracked down on prescribing narcotics, it left him unable to get all the medicines he had previously been prescribed. Once it became too expensive to buy them on the street, he turned to heroin. My fun-loving brother who was always at family functions, loved to be around his nieces and nephews, totally disappeared. I suspected that something more serious was going on, but he wouldn't answer calls or texts. In August, I hadn't seen him in several months. We have always been close. This was very unusual. I sent him a novel of a text since he wouldn't take my phone calls confronting him over the rumors that I had heard of his heroin use. He denied it. A few short weeks later, I got a call from my mother that he was transported to the hospital by ambulance but discharged a few hours later for chest pain. He later told us he had gotten a bad batch of heroin and was certain he was dying. He told the EMS he had used that morning, as well as hospital staff. I still to this day don't understand how someone can come in suffering from an overdose and be discharged a few hours later. People don't have knowledge. They are not being trained in this horrible epidemic that we have in this country. NOTHING was mentioned to him about treatment or rehab and he was treated as a [[Page S949]] lesser person. I was worried before, but after this was in a constant state of fear that I would get a call that my 31- year-old brother was dead. In October, he called me to tell me yes he was a heroin addict, but a new treatment center had opened near his home and he wanted to get clean. He asked if I would go with him, and I said of course yes. His insurance wouldn't cover a dime of this treatment. It would be all out of his pocket at $100 a day plus the cost of meds. For someone working at a $30,000 or less a year job, paying for housing, utilities, food, (he never did receive public assistance)-- He was too proud for that-- this cost was more than he could do. Again I told him I would be there and pay for whatever he couldn't. I convinced him he needed more of a support system than just me and he finally told our parents. We were we were raised in church and came from a large religious family. He was so ashamed of what he had become he didn't want the family to know and the majority of them still don't know to this day. I am hoping, as this letter was written anonymously, eventually he will share this with the family, maybe preventing other members from going down this road. He will tell them when he is ready. My mom and I went with him to his first appointment at the suboxyne clinic, and one of us has been at every appointment since. It is wonderful-- he has a session with a psychiatrist at every visit. It's more than prescribing meds. They are doing the counseling to make sure their patients get clean. I am proud to say that after only four months, not only is he clean but he has weaned off the suboxyne. He still goes for counseling and has the nurse's cell that he can call 24 hours a day if he's having a hard day. In the future he wants to tell his story and help others facing the same crisis. Madam President, I have been reading stories of people addicted all over the State of West Virginia. I have stories from your State also, Madam President. I would like to read that for you. This is in New Hampshire--Sandown, NH. This is Kathleen's story. I am sure she has sent you the same copy she sent me. She wants her name to be known. My name is Kathleen Stephens. I am a 56 year old RN, BSN, from Sandown, NH. I am currently the Director of Clinical Service at a nationwide hospice company. My story is much like thousands of others out there, pretty average, fairly normal. I have two children; a 33-year-old son who graduated with a degree in Mathematics from Boston University and a 31- year-old daughter who graduated with a psychology degree from Assumption College. I myself have a Bachelor of Science and Nursing degree and my children's father a Bachelor's degree in business from Wharton School of Business in PA. I give you this detailed background for to you see that we are a well educated and successful family. We are a white, mid to upper middle class who have always lived in a beautiful neighborhood surrounded by loving families whose children played outside, joined peewee soccer, little league, softball, basketball and girl scouts to name but a few. We were the home in the neighborhood where all the children loved to play. We took our children to drive in movies, camping, the beach, museums and always visited their grandparents. We were normal, that's all, or what we perceived was normal. When speaking with our children now, they both recount wonderful childhoods and deem themselves ``lucky.'' Our house was filled with love. I hugged my kids all the time, never hesitated to demonstrate to or tell them how much I loved them. They had grandparents who were always around, who also demonstrated love for them. About 5 years ago, my daughter, and her boyfriend, an Intern at Tufts Medical School decided, after being together for 2 years that they would move to Sacramento. I was devastated inside but encouraged my daughter to follow her heart. Over the subsequent years, our communications went from daily to weekly to scattered. Each conversation seemed more distant than the last. We saw her an average of twice a year; most significantly, when we paid her expenses to come home for Christmas. Her boyfriend never came; he distanced himself from us almost immediately. I'm sure at this point you know the story. About 18 months ago I finally confronted my daughter asking what was wrong, seeing her go from a loving daughter to a distant person I no longer knew. Over the previous few years, she turned into a virtual stranger. I told her I loved her no matter what and that I would be there for her. At that time she denied any issue. A few weeks later she was in the hospital and called me. Apparently, she had hit bottom. She confided that she was a heroin addict. I was more than shocked. She had been in a substance free dorm in college, hated drinking, drugs and was pretty straight laced overall. I kept myself in check saying that no matter what I would support her, asked her to come home so we could help her. She confided that it started with a prescription for opioids that her boyfriend had shared with her. He was given one for back pain years before, got hooked and decided she might just like it. So, amazingly she did come home, but she went back a few months later. She then returned to get clean again and went back a few months later. She overdosed multiple times, of which I knew nothing until recently. Her boyfriend gave her IV heroin while she was in the hospital being treated for pneumonia to keep her habit going. He was the one, I found out later, that he shot her up because she hated doing it. He had developed a hold on her that was a bond of heroin high. I knew the drug had gotten her when, due to the stress of everything happening, I ended up in the hospital ruling out a heart attack. She drove me there, dropped me off and went to get high (I found out later). I ended up being fine, stress of course, and she ended up going back home yet again. She stayed clean after going into a rehab, which kicked her out after 8 days because her insurance was declined. She then attended NA-- Narcotics Anonymous-- meetings almost daily and got a job that she loved. In the meantime, her boyfriend was found out through a ``random'' drug test and suspended. She was clean for 4 months, the happiest four months of my life. We spoke every few days, or texted. Her voice was truly hers again . . . her laughter, her expressions, her humor. I felt she was finally back with us. She had left her boyfriend and went into a sober living home. Life was good and I was so grateful to have my daughter, my best friend, back. About 3 months into her sobriety she decided to reach out and try to get her boyfriend sober as well, the beginning of the end. At exactly month 4 she went to his house and he had a ``surprise'' for her. She was new in her sobriety, just once she said, and she fell back down the rabbit hole. I knew when she didn't return my calls or texts that it was bad. But finally she responded; she was back into it again, but she'd get out she promised. The next 8 months were a few weeks clean then back into drugs again. I did not send her money. Honestly, she never asked. She knew I'd never support her habit. Around Thanksgiving 2015 she had had it. She called me and said she wanted to get back into rehab and leave her boyfriend permanently. Her life was no longer worth living. Weeks of trying to get her into rehab went unsuccessfully when we finally found Clean and Sober in Sacramento. At that point she was clean two weeks, had slowly packed up or sold her belongings and was ready for the break. But she had to sneak out to get away from her very controlling, manipulative partner; and she did. The happy part: She is today 60 days sober. She has a new job (She had been fired from the other one), which she loves. She blocked her boyfriend from her phone, her email and her facebook. She is the daughter, once again, that I know and love, but I love her regardless of the disease of addiction. Love the addict, hate the disease. And for right now I thank God, pray alot, and take it one day at a time. I have another one here I want to share with you. The thing I wanted to share, Madam President, is this: My State and your State have probably been hit as hard as any two States in the country. We have people coming to us all the time. We are fighting every way we can. We are introducing pieces of legislation. We are not worrying about who is Republican or Democrat. How can we help Americans--the beautiful people in New Hampshire, the wonderful people in West Virginia, who are facing more deaths, more disease, more destruction to the family? I want to share with you that when I first got elected--Senator Byrd had died in 2010. I was Governor of the State of West Virginia. I had to make a decision. I thought maybe I could come to Washington and help with the experiences I had and what I had seen in my State and times. We had challenges. After I was elected to the Senate, I had gone back to Oceana, WV. At that time it had been called ``Oxyana'' because drug use was so rampant in this beautiful town. I remembered this town because when I was a freshman in college, my roommate was from this town. It was the most beautiful town I had been in. They had everything. What a privilege it would have been to grow up in this beautiful town, but I could see many years later it was not the town I knew or remembered in my mind. I went to the middle school. These were all children in fifth to eighth grade. I tried to give pep talks. I wanted to get them involved and tell them how good they could be, how much we are counting on them, what they need to get a good education and contribute something back to society, and how fortunate and lucky they are to be in this little town. After I finished speaking--they were attentive and cooperative--there was a group of them. They asked: Can we talk to you privately? I will never forget this. These were 12- and 13-year-old [[Page S950]] boys and girls. There had to be six or seven of them. I went in the back room and sat at a table. They started talking and telling me their stories. These were stories they had watched and were telling me. This was the first time I had ever heard from a child up close and personal who said: My dad worked at the mines. He had a back problem. He got hurt. They kept giving him pills. We lost our house. Mom and dad were fighting. They got divorced. We lost everything. I've got nothing now. My grandparents were watching me while I was trying to take care of us. My dad is an addict. I heard these stories from these five kids. They were all pleading. Now fast forward to the year 2015. I go back to the same school. These kids that were 12 years old are now seniors in high school. The same group wants to talk to me. They had lived a clean life, but I think about what they have gone through and what they have seen. Then I sit down with another group of 12- and 13-year-olds from the same area. They are telling me stories about how they are watching their lives before them when they watch a boyfriend or a stepfather because the family had broken apart, the mother remarried or whatever, and the person that she is with is a drug addict. This little child watches her mother get shot up and killed because of the drugs the boyfriend shoots into the mother. Can you imagine a 12- or 13-year-old having to live with this and see this happen in their home? What we are asking is simply for the Food and Drug Administration to change, to be the watchdog to help us. They are supposed to protect us. They don't say: I did my job. The pharmaceutical company told me they made this drug, and this is the way it was made. This is what it was supposed to do. We checked it out. Everything is fine; leave it on the market. You are not looking at the welfare of the people. You know what it does. You know it is addictive. We have no treatment centers. We are doing nothing to treat this. We are not challenging these pharmaceutical companies who are good companies. They do a lot of good and put a lot of products out there that are very good, but they are bringing these opiates on the market quicker than ever before, more powerful than ever before, and they know what is going to happen. I am challenging all of them. I think the FDA should challenge them. We are not going to approve more opiates. We are not going to let you bring on the market stronger opiates that we know are addictive and will ruin people's lives. If they will do that and challenge these companies to come out with new research and development that can scientifically give us relief needed for people who have chronic pain without making them addicts who lose their lives--we should be able to do that in this great country. I am going to read you a story from Kentucky, my next door neighbor, the majority leader's home--Kentucky and West Virginia. This is Emily from Louisville, KY. My name is Emily Walden. I am a mother who lost my 21-year- old son to a drug overdose in 2012. My son TJ came from a good family, was a member of the Kentucky National Guard and the most respectful young man you could have ever met. TJ made an initial poor decision that led to an addiction to the drug Opana; he had unlimited access to this drug during that time. TJ did not want to die from this. He tried very hard to overcome his addiction and I tried very hard to save his life. I started researching the drug Opana about five years ago and would like to share with you what I have learned that illustrates the need for changes to our FDA policies and approval processes for all opioid drugs. The drug Opana contains the opioid Oxymorphone which was removed from the market in 1979 due to the overdose deaths and addiction this drug was causing across our country. In 2002, the FDA started holding IMMPACT meetings every year allowing pharmaceutical companies to pay money to be included in discussions and changes to clinical trials, design. We call that pay to play--the impact it has because they are able to go to these types of settings and get absolute front row seats with the people they are trying to persuade to take another look at these drugs that might have been taken off the market because they were deemed too dangerous. This is allowed to go on. It has been going on for far too long, and the FDA is part of it. This is part of the change that needs to be made and made immediately. Endo Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Opana, attended each one of these ``pay-to-play'' meetings. In 2003, Endo Pharmaceuticals brought the drug Opana to the FDA for approval and was denied due to the overdoses that occurred during the clinical trials. In 2006, Endo Pharmaceuticals again brought the drug Opana to the FDA for approval but this time using new clinical trial that applied a modified process, called ``Enriched Enrollment,'' which removed patients with preexisting opiate sensitivities from the trial. The Enriched Enrollment process skews results and seriously underestimates risks associated with the proposed drug involved in the clinical trial. In addition, the FDA ignored their own review guidance by bypassing their advisory committee and approved Opana for moderate to severe pain. At the time Opana was approved, our country was already experiencing an explosion of overdose deaths and addiction from the overprescribing and misrepresentation of the safety of opiates. In addition to causing thousands of deaths and addiction, the approved use of Opana has now been directly implicated in an outbreak of Hepatitis C and HIV cases in the State of Indiana. The FDA has continued to use Enriched Enrollment-- Or pay to play-- to approve new opiates and override or bypass altogether their advisory committee for new opiate approvals and for new uses of opiates further contributing to the overdose deaths and addiction. These process changes must stop. The year after my son died I traveled to Washington DC for the first time in my life and was very fortunate to be able to meet with the then Senate Minority Leader-- Now Senate majority leader-- Senator McConnell, the next year I had nine meetings which included a meeting with then acting Director Botticelli of ONDCP, DEA Administrator Michelle Leonhart and seven meetings with Senator's staff. In 2015 I had thirteen meetings scheduled. I am not going away! We need change to curb this horrible epidemic that started with prescribed opiates and the mistakes that were made need to be corrected. How many people have to die? How many more people have to become addicted? The FDA is sending the wrong message to physicians by continuing to approve opioids during the worst drug epidemic our country has ever faced. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator's postcloture time has expired. Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous consent to continue. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Madam President. The FDA is supposed to be protecting public health and yet over 200,000 people have died and they have failed to put appropriate restrictions on these dangerous drugs to prevent overdose deaths. I want to know why there is one death from something such as ecoli and every head of lettuce is pulled from the shelves in ten different states but opioids have killed thousands of people and they are considered safe and effective? How can that be? When is the FDA going to put human life before the paychecks of Big Pharma? What will it take? A million deaths? We need an FDA commissioner that will protect the citizens of this country that is willing to take the overall best interest of public safety into consideration and not allow the pharmaceutical companies to have him in their back pockets. My son TJ had a lifelong dream of joining the military and fighting for his country. He would have given his life to protect and serve. He was one of the most patriotic young men and his country failed him. Please do the right thing. Please do not let one more mother get a knock on her door saying their child is gone and that they will never [ever] come home [again]. There is no greater pain than burying your child! My son, my precious child with the most beautiful blue eyes, caring and loving heart, died in part by the greed of big Pharma and-- Most importantly-- the carelessness of the FDA. It is time for change! Another story from Kentucky. This is in Northern Kentucky and this is Kimberly's story. My name is Kimberly Wright. I am a [mother from Northern Kentucky] who works in the trenches to save the lives of people in my Community. NKY was hit by a pill epidemic around 2000. That pill Epidemic has now turned into a Heroin Epidemic. Since 2013 the death toll continues to climb. In 2015 we have had 1,168 overdose reverses. We still await the number of deaths. Our entire system is on the verge of collapse--our Courts, Police, Children's Services, Jails. Our jails currently have 99% Heroin and Pill cases housed in the jails. Our Treatment system is seriously strained with not 1 new bed added in the last 10 years since this epidemic started. We are in a War in [Northern Kentucky]. Every day we wait to see how many died that day. We have people getting in their cars driving high on pills and Heroin wrecking into innocent people and killing them. This is the United States of America and this is a shame. We allow the FDA and Big Pharma to profit off the deaths of an entire generation of young people. We are in effect losing 2 jumbo jets full of kids every day [[Page S951]] in America due to Pills and Heroin. We need help. We are begging for help to stop this madness. Our American families are losing our children at an alarming rate to overprescribing Drs and Big Pharma. We beg you, please help us stop this. I lost my sister Alicia Cook on October 26, 2010, to an overdose. Alicia was a nurse with 2 young daughters. This Epidemic has no boundaries and it's in every community in the Country. Northern Kentucky has the highest rates of HEPC, surpassing the National Level, due to heroin and pills being injected. We have a high rate of homeless children due to their parents being dead or drug addicted with no end in sight. We have 52% of grandparents raising their grandchildren due to death and addiction. This is a nightmare for parents. When our children were born we could have never imagined this would be our life. You don't sleep at night from the anxiety of wondering if you are the next parent to get that call that your child has overdosed. It's like being in a constant panic attack. It's not normal to grieve the loss of a child who is alive, for they are truly lost. I [know lots of] parents who have lost their child and I can't imagine their pain and grief. I grieve for my addicted 26- year-old daughter who is in the fight of her life [because of] her Addiction. I watch her destroying herself every day. I don't want to join the mothers who have lost their child to this Epidemic. I know how I suffer now and I just can't go there. I will continue to fight for my community. Will you [please] join me? That is Arlene's story. Indiana is one of the States that has been hit so hard also. This is Danielle's story from Southern Indiana. My name is Danielle McCowan. I live in southern Indiana and work as a server. About 2 and a half years ago a customer by the name of Josh Harvey left me his number. At the time he told me he was living in Chicago for school. Little did I know he was in rehab there. Granted, I didn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in constant contact. Over a year or so ago I found out about his heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know it started out with prescription pills and later went to heroin when the pills became harder to get. He served a month in jail in Michigan for the entire month of this past July over a heroin related charge. He came home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. Luckily, his dad saved him that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient program doing better. Or so we all thought. School let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came to me on November the 4th telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. I suggested an in-patient program. He went to Wellstone after he left my house. He sat for several hours and finally was given a room. I went and checked on him 2 different times while he waited to make sure he was there. Thursday I didn't receive any calls. Friday nothing either. Then Saturday morning, the 7th of November, his mother called me to break my heart. He had passed away that Friday, the 6th, over in Louisville and didn't know who to contact until that Saturday morning, I guess. He had checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into his house, took his Xbox which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. Never in a million years did I think I'd become close to anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn't discriminate. It can get ahold of any and everybody. Never in my life have I been so depressed or heartbroken. All I want is his story shared. He was my happy ending gone away too soon. They continue. They continue on, these stories, the heartaches and the lives destroyed, lives changed. Few too many lives are saved. Massachusetts. As the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Markey has been working with me very closely and all of us on this horrible epidemic that we have. This is Sara's story. She is from Amherst, MA. My nuclear family is middle class or the working poor, but it is blended in that I was raised by my mother and step-dad, but my bio father's side of the family would be considered well-off. Heroin first came to my radar after my brother Donny became addicted to pain pills after surgery, and heroin followed suit after RX's stopped. Then it seemed like it was everywhere around me: my nephew, my niece. Then we lost my cousin Cory, who passed in a sober house for his addiction to alcohol, along with a needle and an empty bag next to him. Cory is an example of a young man institutionalized by multiple incarcerations and just when he would try to lift himself up, in he would go again. He was trying to get clean for his girlfriend and unborn child when he passed away, and he was happy, thinking he was getting better. Living with someone close who struggles and then multiply that by two, and adolescence, young adulthood mixed in, and you have my descent as an empathetic aunt who felt powerless to change anything. Then the bottom dropped out. My cousin, John Ahern, passed at the end of August after a long period of recovery alone in the woods. It didn't matter he came from privilege or was the nicest person I had every known in my life for so long. He leaves behind three loving sons. They both couldn't access the help they needed at various stages, including recovery, and died alone. It is my mission to stand up for them and the young people like my niece who began her struggle at 14, and now approaching 18 has some clean time. There are no support programs in my community for this age group, and especially for non-White young people like my niece and nephew. They are both of Latino descent. Please do something. People are begging us everywhere in this country to help them, and basically it starts with treating this as an illness and not as a crime. It starts also with having clinics, having basic places where we can serve them and help them get clean. They cannot do it by themselves, and they are the first to tell you. The stories I am reading here exemplify that so well. I have a Florida story here, and Florida has also been ravaged. Florida was a problem that we had in West Virginia because of the pill mills there. People would take the bus down or they could take a cheap flight down to Florida, buy all the pills they could and come back. Florida has been very helpful in the last years trying to stop the pill epidemic. This is Janet from Fort Lauderdale. Dear Senator Manchin. I appreciate you taking the time to stop the appointment of Dr. Califf from becoming the FDA commissioner. I founded STOPPnow--Stop the Organized Pill Pushers now--due to all the drug-addicted babies I was caring for as a neonatal intensive care nurse at a children's hospital in Broward County, FL. We started holding protests in front of the 150 pill mills that were in Broward County alone. Many parents came out to protest with us. Parents from all over the country contacted us as well. Too many parents are crying themselves to sleep over the loss of their child. At first, there were no consequences for either the clinic owner or the doctor. Then they started arresting the doctors for money laundering. Our State's attorney has called the doctors drug dealers in white coats. The Board of Medicine is not protecting the public by allowing high-prescribing doctors to keep their license. Therefore, the plight of the drug-addicted babies and the devastation to the families continues to rise. When one clinic owner was arrested, he was earning $150,000 a day. I repeat, $150,000 a day. Not one doctor in that clinic to date has lost his license or his practice. We only have the judicial system helping to alleviate this in Florida. Doctors are now being charged with first-degree murder. It would be kinder for a doctor to lose his license than to sit in a courtroom at their own murder trial. We have been unsuccessful in our efforts for lawmakers to mandate that prescribers use the prescription drug monitoring program in Florida. Yet in this environment, there is a bill passing through the committees allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe narcotics without a doctor signing off on the order. I would support this bill if they included the mandate. And, of course, the FDA approved that children as young as 11 years old can be prescribed OxyContin. We definitely need an investigation. Madam President, as you can see, these are problems that we have all over the country. This is not just your State and not just my State. I know it is hard. They say we need someone in there, so let's just go ahead and confirm Dr. Califf. Dr. Califf is an honorable man. He is still there. He is going to be there. He has been there for 1 year. In the 1 year that he has been there, we have basically put more opiate drugs on the market without even going through a clinical overview. If that change were going to come, it would have come by now. I am sure he could have had input, and I would hope that he would. Dr. Califf has called a lot of our colleagues and said that these changes will be coming. This Senator will tell you the changes they recommended when they said they were going to make changes. They said: We are going to make sure that we are going to start listening to our staff and people who are reviewing these drugs. They are going to listen to them, but there is no mandate that they will have to follow. This Senator has a piece of legislation that the Presiding Officer coauthored, and I appreciate that very much. Basically what we are saying is this: When you have your advisory committee--and every drug must go through an advisory committee's opinion, and if they recommend as they did with Zohydro to not let it go on the market, that cannot be bypassed, neglected, or pushed aside. Our bill would basically state that they must bring it to the people's representatives in Congress and state why it is so very important for them to bring this new high- powered drug to the market--as if we don't have enough. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population but consumes 80 [[Page S952]] percent of these addictive opiate drugs. Something is wrong. Something must change. I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to be able to read the letters of people who have been affected by this all over this great country in all of our States. I know we feel the pain, and we are going to try to make these changes and make sure this agency will do what it is supposed to do. I yield the floor. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S943-S952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUANTANAMO DETAINEES Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about President Obama's plan to move Guantanamo Bay terrorists to the United States. However, it is not much of a plan. With all due respect, it is more of a failed attempt to fulfill a campaign promise and, in my view, what he believes will secure his legacy. Fortunately for us--those who believe that moving dangerous enemy combatants within our communities is dangerous, irresponsible, and an illogical idea--the President's plan contains nothing really substantive. In fact, it fails to recommend an alternative location to any current facility at all. As a matter of fact, I call that a win. The plan does not provide any intelligence to substantiate the President's claims, nor does it even provide a chart or a graph to support the mathematics on the alleged cost savings, and there is no estimate regarding the cost to [[Page S944]] local and State governments to support such a move. Indeed, the 9-page report is short in every regard. The White House received the Department of Defense's results of their site surveys and other data regarding a potential closing last month. And this--I am holding up the report here--this is all we have in return: 9 pages. I know the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, my good friend and colleague, Senator John McCain, is not going to be pleased with the lack of substance or data or the articulation of a real plan. The same goes for Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who at this particular time is going to be introducing legislation of his own to provide intelligence with regard to the administration's lack of intelligence on moving detainees to the United States. The lack of a plan and the inability of this administration to provide an alternative site indicate that none of the sites visited by DOD's survey team met the demands necessary to hold detainees and, more important, keep our community safe. The fact that no site was named and no substance on those visits was provided tells me there is no alternative to match what we are now doing safely and securely at Gitmo, period. This so-called plan, as outlined by the President in his speech today from the White House, skims over four steps to closing Guantanamo Bay. First, it articulates the administration's plan to continue moving detainees designated for transfer by the President's national security team to foreign countries. In some instances, this may have been successful with regard to individuals being rehabilitated, but a third of the time, detainees transferred to third-party host countries have returned to the battlefield. And these are just the ones we know about. This is called recidivism, and the rates are too high for this process to be called ``secure and responsible,'' as the administration has labeled it. Second, the administration plans to continue its review of the threat posed by those detainees who are not currently eligible for transfer through the Periodic Review Board. This is to provide a new review on the current population of detainees who have been deemed too dangerous to transfer--deemed too dangerous to transfer, and yet this President wants to give them a second shot at getting out. This doesn't make any sense. Terrorists are not criminals. As much as this President would like for you to believe they are, terrorists are not equal to the inmates we have across America's prison system. They are fixated on the destruction of America. They have no regard for life, not that of their own and especially not the lives of innocent civilians. The report hones in on having a detainee population anywhere from 30 to 60. There seems to be an assumption on the part of the President that the review board will determine that half of those deemed too dangerous for transfer or release are suddenly safe for transfer or release. Does the President believe this is possible or does this assumption simply serve his own means to create cost savings for his plan that can never be realized? The plan also fails to account for the fact that our Nation is still mired in the War on Terrorism. We are still fighting in the Middle East and worldwide, including the United States of America, to ensure that terrorism does not prevail. What about the individuals we detain from this day forward? What about those individuals with critical information related to the next terrorist threat? How can we operate without a facility like Guantanamo Bay to hold terrorists we take off the battlefield? Third, the plan attempts to identify individual dispositions, one by one, for those who remain designated for continued law of war detention, to include Article III, military commissions, or foreign prosecutions. What a muddle. In his remarks today, President Obama advocated for trying terrorist suspects in Article III courts. The President named two American citizens--Faisal Shahzad and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev--to articulate his point. Both of those individuals, however, were apprehended in the United States, not on the battlefield. The intent of the Guantanamo detention facility is to protect the American people by removing terrorists from the battlefield. As the United States faces a growing threat from terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, which have tens of thousands of members, bringing those terrorists to the United States to stand trial simply cannot be the answer. It is not safe for the American people and irresponsible to our national security. Fourth, the plan states the administration's desire to ``work with Congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' That is in quotes, ``work with Congress.'' Well, there is something that is unique with the President, ``work with Congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' But it does not anywhere in its nine pages endorse a specific facility to house Guantanamo detainees; rather, the plan describes a prototype for a detention facility in the United States--not Kansas, not Colorado, not South Carolina, not anywhere in the United States. The President's long-awaited plan is to work with Congress to identify the most appropriate location as soon as possible, according to the summary provided to my office by the Department of Defense. Question: How could it take 7 years to arrive at the idea to work with Congress? What a novel idea, but only for this express purpose. If the President had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in this plan. If he had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in 2009 when we stopped his plan the first time. Further, the plan fails to substantiate President Obama's repeated claims that Guantanamo Bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists. Let me repeat this. The plan fails to substantiate President Obama's repeated claims that Guantanamo Bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists, a rallying point for terrorist attacks, hindering relations with allies, and draining Department of Defense resources. My goodness. I wrote Defense Secretary Ash Carter in November to ask for intelligence reports or data to support many of these assertions. I asked Secretary Carter if an intelligence assessment has been done in conjunction with the site surveys recently conducted by the Department of Defense from the safety of our community's standpoint. I asked for the Department's rationale for evaluating Fort Leavenworth, when three previous evaluations have made it abundantly clear it is and continues to be an unacceptable alternative. I asked if there were intelligence products regarding previous site evaluations at Fort Leavenworth. The administration has argued that Guantanamo is a recruiting tool for terrorists. So I logically asked for an intelligence assessment to support that argument. As a follow on, I asked what assessment had been done to reflect that Guantanamo has increased terrorist recruitment. And finally, was there any empirical data to support the administration's argument that national security threats will decrease if enemy combatants are held in the United States? Common sense will tell you that it would increase. Two months later, the response confirmed my assumptions. The Department of Defense had no intelligence products--none. There were no intelligence products, no data to provide to support the President's argument that GTMO serves as a recruiting tool and that moving detainees to the mainland would increase security and decrease the terrorist threat to the United States. My colleagues, this plan really confirms what many of us already know: There is no safe alternative to GTMO--not in Kansas, not in Colorado, not in South Carolina. Nowhere on the mainland is there a secure and responsible alternative. If there were, this President would not have failed to articulate it in his plan. Mr. President, a plan that is a legacy speech does not safeguard the lives of the American people. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on the nomination. Mr. MANCHIN. I wish to speak on the nomination of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Robert Califf. [[Page S945]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I believe the FDA needs new leadership, a new focus and a new culture, and Dr. Robert Califf's past involvement with the pharmaceutical industry reflects that he will not be this person. He will not have the impact or leadership capabilities the Nation needs to stem the tide of the opioid crisis we have all over this country, even in your great State of Oklahoma and my State of West Virginia, which has been ravaged by this. I would like to put this in context for a little bit. He has been there over a year--a good man. I am not speaking about his ability, his honesty, his integrity, his education, his background, and all the good work he has done. But he has been there for a year, and for the past 20 years Dr. Califf basically has come from the institutional research side, from education, and with that, his support has come from the pharmaceutical industries, those that are putting opioids on the market. I just feel it would be hard, human naturewise, for him to change and rule to keep these products from coming onto the market. So to put this in context, this is not personally about Dr. Califf. This is about the culture he comes from and the year he has been there as the No. 2 man and what has happened during that period of time. Let me go over some things. Over the last decade, the FDA has approved new drugs at historically high rates. In 2008, companies filing applications to sell never-before-marketed drugs were denied 66 percent of the time. They were denied 66 percent of the time. Yet between the beginning of 2015 and August of 2015, the FDA rejected only 3 uses for new chemical entities and approved 25. That is an approval rate of 89 percent. Now, tell me how in 7 short years that culture changed to where anything and everything coming at us was passed through, when we have already become the most addicted country on Earth. If one looks at new drugs and not the use of drugs, they have rejected only 1 and approved 23. That is a 96-percent approval rate in 2015. So of the new drugs that came to the market, only 1 was rejected--a 96-percent approval rate. In 2008, the FDA's approval of new marketing claims for existing drugs was 56 percent. In the first 8 months of 2015, it was 88 percent. This includes approving OxyContin for children as young as 11. The FDA's 2013 approval of Zohydro drew widespread concern. All of us were outraged when we heard this new drug came on the market. To put another time period in context, I had worked for 3 years to try to get all opioids from a schedule III to a schedule II so doctors could prescribe only for 30 days. You had to go back and see your doctor. Up until that time, Vicodin and Lortab--the two most widely prescribed opioids--were schedule III. That means you could get a 90- day prescription and then call in to get it refilled. They were going out like M&Ms. We were able to do that, and no sooner did we get that done--and it took 3 years, when it should have been 3 weeks. Within the same week that all opioids got to us from a schedule III to a schedule II, they approved a new drug called Zohydro, which was 10 times more powerful than Vicodin or Lortab--much more powerful. That approval was done against their advisory committee 11 to 2. That means 13 experts evaluated this drug and said: It is not needed, too powerful, don't do it. Guess what, they did it anyway. Now they are saying that they are not going to pay attention to the advisory committee. Not only did they say they are not going to pay attention to the advisory committee, but we have had the decision on OxyContin being given to 11-year-old children; we have had the two new drugs that came out in 2014 after Zohydro and the pushback from Senators representing our respective States; they had a new drug called Targiniq, which is an extended-release OxyContin product, and Hysingla, which is an extended-release hydrocodone product. So there were three new decisions made, with two new powerful opioids coming to the market and the decision that OxyContin would be given to 11-year-olds. That was done without any review from the advisory committee. They got so much pushback from Zohydro, they said: We are not going down this path again. We will just not have anybody review it. We will just go ahead and do it. If you believe that is a culture that will protect the welfare and well-being of our citizens in our States all through this great country of ours, then I am sorry because I don't. I am sorry, but that is why I have been so passionate. I have more people dying of legal prescription drug abuse than anything else in the State of West Virginia. More people die. It is ravaging families. I have personal letters I will read, and they will tear your heart out with what is happening and how this grips and tears people apart. It tears communities apart. Every law enforcement agency in America will tell you--no matter what town they are in, what county they are in, or what State they are in--that over 80 percent and upward of 95 percent of all crimes committed are drug related, are some sort of drug related. There is not one of us right now in this beautiful Senate Chamber that doesn't know somebody in our immediate family or Senate family that hasn't been affected by drugs, either prescription legal drugs or illegal drugs. It is awful. It is an epidemic. I believe the FDA must break its cozy relationship with the pharmaceutical industry and instead start a relationship with the millions of Americans. I have said that I am going to fight against the FDA protecting a business plan and hopefully the culture will change, and they will start protecting America and the plan of families and citizens of this great country to have a healthy lifestyle. It is because of this belief that I am urging my colleagues to vote against the confirmation of Dr. Robert Califf as the director of the Food and Drug Administration. He will still be there and still be a valuable person. He is just not that person with the passion to change the culture in this important agency. We have let this sleeping giant go for far too long. My office has been absolutely flooded, Mr. President, with stories from West Virginians--but I have received them from all over the country--who want their voices to be heard. They say: Please use my name. I am not ashamed. We have been hiding too long. I have watched too many people's lives be destroyed. So today I will read letters not only from West Virginians but also people across this great country of ours that have been impacted by the opioid abuse epidemic. I urge my colleagues to listen to these letters from their States and stories from my State about these drugs before confirming Dr. Califf, and in all good conscience make that decision tomorrow when we vote. Do you really believe he can bring the changes needed and not just say: Well, we have to have somebody there. He is already there. He will do a good job where he is; he is just not going to be able to kick them and shake them up and say we are not going down this path any more. There are some good people. We have made some recommendations of some good people who would bring the cultural changes that need to be brought. I am going to read first about a young lady from Southern West Virginia. Her name is Chelsea. This is her story. As a recovering addict, I have watched myself, my friends, and loved ones suffer from this horrible thing we call addiction. As I watch all these people now suffering, I know they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, and neither did I. Whether it be for pain or just simply hanging with the wrong people like I did, we all have one thing in common, we chose to do drugs for the first time. Someone made a decision to do drugs for the first time. Growing up, I can honestly say I had what most people would call a normal childhood. Chelsea comes from an upper socioeconomic family in Southern West Virginia. She continues: I was raised by two hardworking parents who would and will still do anything for me. I was a gymnast and a cheerleader for most of my life and went to church every Wednesday and Sunday. My dad was even the Mayor of Madison at one point. But even being raised up in a good home did not stop me from doing drugs. So this has no socioeconomic bearing. It does not. It is not a partisan issue. Whether you are a Democrat or [[Page S946]] Republican, it makes no difference. Rich or poor makes no difference. Chelsea continues: I can still remember the first time I heard about someone getting high. I was in the 6th grade and became friends with a girl whose parents got high themselves. We would walk about the playground and she would talk of these things called ``drugs.'' As she talked day in and day out about how getting high made her feel, it made me start to wonder what this thing called ``getting high'' was really about. Now, mind you, I am talking about a 12-year-old girl. She was just 12 years old. I can remember thinking how cool I thought it was that her parents had done drugs with her and would party with her. So another friend of hers, also 12 years old, had parents who were doing drugs with her and would party with her. Chelsea continues: One weekend I went to her house to stay the night and this was the first time I had gotten high. We smoked some pot, drank some alcohol, and I was turned on to my first pill around the age of 12. From this day forward, my life would forever be changed. From the ages twelve to fifteen I partied some on the weekends and sometimes during the week, but as time went on my addiction and tolerance grew more and more. By this time, I was doing more pills because I had access to them. Between stealing Lortabs off my dad, to hanging with that girl so we could get high with her dad, to buying pills off the local drug dealer on the street, I had moved from doing them every now and then to every day. I would stay a lot of weekends at this girl's house just to get high because my parents would never have done that nor did they know I was doing it. By sixteen my life took another turn. My grandmother, who I called Nana, had taken care of me most of my life while my mother worked. She was diagnosed with lung cancer two years prior. In the last days of her life, I would visit her in the hospital and she would tell me how proud she was of me and how I was her little model. I had also met a very special guy by the name of J.R. a few months before this who I spent a lot of time with. On July 18, 2003, my Nana passed away. On the day of her wake, J.R. took me out to dinner, and on the way home he asked me to go meet his dad. I explained to him I could not and that my grandma's funeral was the next day. He dropped me off that night, kissed me good-bye, and that was the last time I ever heard from J.R. Twenty minutes after he left me, he wrecked and died. I felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. The day of his funeral is the next time I met the love of my life that would soon try to destroy my life. It was called OxyContin. I fell in love immediately with OxyContin. It took all of my cares and worries away, and from that moment on all I wanted to do was be numb. As the years passed, my drug addiction grew worse. I was not only doing pain pills, I was now experimenting with all kinds of other things. I can still remember my senior week in high school. While everyone was excited about going to the beach, I had to make sure I had enough drugs to go and not be sick. I took Roxy's and Oxy's, pretty much anything I could get my hands on, and eight balls of cocaine. By this time in my life I didn't care about anything. It never once had crossed my mind that if I got caught with all of that I could go to jail. I was just worried about my next high. The following months were the same. I was doing anything I could to get my hands on drugs, from pain pills to cocaine to meth. I did not care as long as I was high. I was hanging around with people who were as sick as I was and places that I look back now that I would not even take my dog. At 19 I met a guy who would fuel my drug addiction even more. He was 40 years old and dealt OxyContin. At this point I could not afford my habit, so I did what I had to do. I started seeing my drug dealer. My life soon went from bad to worse. I had OxyContin 80s any time I wanted them, and at the time I thought life can't get any better than this. When you are doing eight to ten OxyContin 80s a day, you will do whatever it takes to get them. At this point I was turned on to heroin. Heroin would have taken my life if it hadn't scared me so much. The high from heroin is so intense that anyone who had done it would have fallen in love. But, actually, it scared the life out of me. As time passed and I wasn't getting high like I wanted to anymore from snorting OxyContin, I decided to start shooting up. That is one thing I never thought I would do is shoot up. I always told myself that people who shot up were the homeless people on the streets, complete and utter trash. Now here I was sticking a needle in my arm to get what I wanted. And to be honest, I thought life was bad before. It just got a whole lot worse. The life I was and the life that I knew was gone, and OxyContin was completely ruling my life now. OxyContin is a legal drug made by a legal pharmaceutical that knew exactly the effects this would have when they put this on the market over 20 years ago. She said: What stood before everyone was pure addiction. I had started stealing off of everyone by now and didn't care who I hurt. People's priceless possessions that meant so much to them meant nothing to me. All I'd seen was my next fix. That's all I could see. People were bringing me stolen stuff and I was taking it to the nearest pawn shop or my drug dealer. I had no shame. I had needle marks all up and down my arms, and I would lie to my family about how they got there. It was like I had no conscience, or, better yet, my addiction was my conscience. Eventually I got caught stealing and was charged with 17 different felonies and one misdemeanor. This still did not slow me down even though I was looking at two to 20 years in prison. Nothing scared me more than being sick from the drugs. On September 29, 2008, I was called in for a random drug test and failed because I had shot up OxyContin the day before. At the courthouse they handcuffed me and shackled me and sent me to Southwestern Regional Jail where I did a total of 10 days. As I sat there in that jail cell and cried, I thought a pill could not be worth two to 20 years of my life, and I hit my knees and prayed to God that if He brought me out of that jail cell, that I would never, ever, ever touch drugs again. The Lord answered my prayer and the judge gave me the choice to stay in jail or go to the Life Center of Galax, in Galax, Virginia. I chose to go to rehab. I completed the 30-day program and came back and did Thomas Memorial's intense outpatient program for 6 more weeks. Once I got home I was sentenced to two to 20 years, but they suspended my sentence. I went through drug court and completed it. I was the third person to ever graduate from the Lincoln County Drug Court. I also had to do 14 more days in jail, 6 months of home confinement, and 4 years' probation. I can honestly say that going to jail and rehab saved my life. If I hadn't have been put in jail, I would probably be 6 feet in the ground just like a lot of my friends that I had to bury. All of these things combined gave me something I hold very dear to my heart. My recovery. Recovery has not only given my life back. It has given me a chance to be a daughter, a sister, a wife, and hopefully a mother someday, a productive member of society, a good friend, but most of all, my recovery has given me a chance to be the voice of the sick and suffering addicts who lay in bed at night wondering if there is a way out. I enjoy giving people hope and showing them that treatment does work. I am living proof that if you work the program of recovery, it will work for you. Since that day I had found myself sitting in that jail cell with no hope and my life completely consumed by my addiction, my life has changed for the better. I have graduated with an Associate's Degree in applied science from Southern West Virginia Community Technical College. I went on to get my Bachelor's degree in the arts of psychology from West Virginia State University, and now I am currently working on my Masters of Social Work degree at Concord University, and I will graduate with that degree in May. I have also been able to go to various schools, drug courts, and different places around the state to tell my story of addiction from where I was then to where I am now. I have also had the pleasure of working with a great group of people who are trying to get a sober living home open in Danville, West Virginia called the Hero House. I can tell you, she is so passionate about getting this Hero House so she can help other people. Anybody listening who wants to help Chelsea in Danville, WV, with the Hero House, please do so or contact my office. Now, with all this being said, I don't tell my story to get praise. I tell my story because there is a son, a daughter, a husband, a father, a wife, and many, many other people out there addicted to drugs and they do not see a light at the end of the tunnel. When you are in active addiction, that light is so dim and a lot of times people think they are going to die from this horrible disease. But I am here to show people that you don't have to die. You don't have to let that horrible addiction win. You can step out and take your life back, because I am here to tell you that if you don't, if you don't, your addiction is going to take you to your grave. Drugs do not discriminate. They know no good, no bad, no rich, no poor. There are so many people out there who suffer from this because there is little to no treatment. By the grace of God I was sent to rehab and given a second chance. I still have the horrible reminders every day of the things I did to my family, to my body, and, most of all, to my self-esteem. I have the track marks after being 7 years sober that constantly remind me of the life I once lived. I have a poor self-image because of the men I chose to give myself to just to get a pill, and the damage I did to my family because I had no cares in the world. One day I hope there is enough treatment to help the addicts who want help. People need to be given a second chance and shown there is a better way of life than to do drugs. [[Page S947]] I have another story called Tami's story, but I know Chelsea. I know this girl. She is impressive. She said: Please tell my story, I want people to know. No one could come from a finer family than I came from. No one can go lower than I have gone, and no one but by the grace of God could be saved like I was. When we hear these stories--and all she is saying is there is no treatment. She was lucky. She found a treatment center. Somehow we have to come to grips with this. We have a tax on tobacco because we know it is harmful and we have to cure people of the disease. We have a tax on alcohol. We have no fee whatsoever on opiates--none--and it is destroying lives like nothing else that has ever happened in this country. We need to make people conscious of this, and we need to have an FDA that is compassionate, but not only that, is committed to the change that needs to be made in our culture. I want to read Tami's story, from West Virginia. That is in the northern panhandle. Chelsea was way down in the southern part of our State of West Virginia. We have 2 adult children suffering from substance use disorder. Our son entered the military while in college. He was sent to Iraq right after 9/11, December 27, 2001. He experienced things that he never talked about, celebrated his 21st birthday there, and returned home. He was not a saint when he went to war. He had a juvenile past of drinking. Back then we thought he was a typical teenager acting out. When he returned, he suffered PTSD, as many do, and went to the VA hospital for treatment. He was put on cocktail after cocktail of medications. We all know this. We all know that basically these brave men and women who are willing to risk their lives and sacrifice their lives for us--in order to treat their pain, we think, just give them a prescription, and they are able to get anything and everything. That is what they are talking about when he was put on cocktail after cocktail of medications--was this his starting point of the spiral into addiction? I believe his addiction to opioids, benzoids, and amphetamines started then. I know that he spiraled from that point on. He lost his marriage, he didn't see his son, he bounced from drugs to drugs to drugs. He obtained several DUIs, and time after time he walked away, no offer of help, no sentencing. He bounced, married again. She was addicted to heroin. He bounced again, was in and out of our house. Unfortunately, we always gave him a safe place to land. She said: ``Unfortunately,''--not fortunately but unfortunately--``we always gave him a safe place to land.'' The last time I saw him is when I called the police on him. I discovered that him and his girlfriend, with two small children, who had been living in our house for four months were using and selling drugs. I found out he was recently incarcerated for drug traffic and sent to a correctional rehabilitation facility. Our daughter was an athlete all through school. She received injury after injury, and at 18 started seeing specialists for back pain. That was in 2004. They prescribed opiates. I never saw the addiction coming. She lost her best friend since first grade that year to a drunk driving accident. She went to counseling. More prescriptions. She appeared fine, gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, and then because of back pain more pain prescriptions were given. I realized she had a problem when she was pregnant with her second child and was stepped down to Vicodin while pregnant. Vicodin while pregnant. After his birth, we started her first rehab experience. She returned to the father of her children sober. She relapsed and began snorting heroin. At this time she was living in Ohio and we were unaware of her relapse. We found out when her mother-in-law went to court and took her children. That was one of the worst days of all of our lives. We immediately picked her up, brought her back to West Virginia, and into treatment. Fast forward. Thousands of dollars later on attorneys, doctors, rehab, she returns to Ohio to try to obtain her children. Relapsed. She began shooting heroin and then arrested. We let her sit in jail and picked her up on her release. Charges were dismissed. Back to West Virginia she comes, hospitalized for a week and rehab again. She has now been in recovery for 13 months. She fell in love with a nice, drug-free man, moved to Ohio to try to obtain custody of her children back, and is six months pregnant. One thing I can say is my daughter was always a good mother. Even while on active addiction, she worked and took care of them. As you can tell, both of our children became addicted to prescription drugs first. . . And they tell me this is exactly how it starts. It starts at a very young age. Recreational marijuana, prescription drugs out of your parents' medicine cabinet, taking it to school, being the cool kid in school, sharing those drugs, then you begin using them, then you sell them. This is how it starts, and it leads to obtaining street drugs to feed their addiction. So it goes from occasional to recreational to addiction to feeding that addiction. This is a condensed version of course. As with any family dealing with addiction, it does not show the tears, the hurt, the financial breakdown put on the family; (we are broke). Literally and figuratively. She says: I want to thank you for listening. Doctors keep prescribing pills, and they will tell you that they have had very little training in this area. As they go through all of their medical schools and advanced training, they get very little training on the effects these drugs have on human beings and the addiction. We took 1 billion pills off the market when we went from 90 days to 30 days of Vicodin and Lortab. We took that many pills off the market. That means 30 days. I have people in my office or in their families--and I know the Presiding Officer does as well--who will go to the doctor for something where they may need pain relief for 1 or 2 days. Do you know what they get? They automatically get enough pills for 30 days. That is the path of least resistance. It is legal, they can do it, and the doctor will write a 30-day prescription. We are working on a bill that will be coming to the floor. We need to make a lot of changes to that bill, but most importantly, we need to make sure we have an agency in the Federal Government of the United States of America that is fighting to protect every American. And it is not a business plan that we have to adhere to, not at all. These are good companies. They are legal pharmaceutical companies. They do an awful lot of good. I challenge every one of them that is listening to what we are talking about right now to give us pain relief without addiction to opioids. Do something. Break through the chemistry or something. It has to be there. We have been able to solve every other epidemic. We have been able to cure epidemics and pandemics, and now we have one that has been ravaging our country for almost 30 years. I have Samantha's story. She says: Hello. My name is Samantha Holbrooke. She wants you to know her name. I am from Fayette County, WV. I am a 28-year-old female. I have been an addict for the past 6 years. This letter is to explain to you how addiction has affected my life. It is also to express my view on drugs and what it is doing to our society. I first started drugs when I was 13 years old. I was a recreational marijuana user. My mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict. My father was not in the home or involved in my life. Unfortunately, that is true for many people around this country. My mother would allow me to drink with her and go to bars. I was often her designated driver, but I was only 13 years old. I got in my first and only bar fight at 13. It was with a 24-year-old woman. She thought I was coming on to her boyfriend. In reality, we were smoking weed, not trying to hook up. When I was 19, my oldest sister and mother introduced me to hydrocodone, Ritalin, Xanax, and Percocet. My sister and mother had no income; I did. By getting me on pills, they were able to get free pills by charging me to get them for them. By the time I was 22, I think I was snorting Oxycodone. Oxycodone is made in a single source, which is a powder form that is compressed. They would break it down, crush it, and snort it to get the quicker high. That became my drug of choice. I eventually got in with a doctor who was pretty much a pill mill. We know we have them all over this country. He wrote me a prescription for Xanax and Oxycodone. I got even more strung out on those two. As a result of using drugs, I now have memory problems, concentration problems, and the list goes on and on. I lost about 30 pounds. I lost my job. I lost my home. I lost my child. I lost my fiance to suicide. He was drunk when he shot himself in the head. I believe that had he not been drinking, he wouldn't have taken his own life. As a result of these life-changing events, I became severely depressed. I then took the wrong road and began to use drugs intravenously. I started lying and stealing. This led me to gain two felony charges and several other misdemeanors. I went to jail and prison and spent 2\1/2\ years locked up. I am now on DRC because I am on parole and had a relapse, which led to several bad decisions, and now I am paying the consequences. I am now in recovery. I am a recovering addict. I joined Narcotics Anonymous and [[Page S948]] Alcoholics Anonymous. The classes and programming in prison helped me to think better. I now analyze a situation before making a decision. This is my story. Prescription drugs and all drugs have ruined a large percentage of the citizens of West Virginia's lives. I am now in full control of my life again, thank the Lord. This story is anonymous, but they wanted to share it with us. I grew up in a nice home. My grandfather was a pastor. My dad grew up in church. My family went to church every Sunday. We had a nice house. We had nice cars. My mom didn't have to work, and my dad took very good care of us. My dad had surgery, a common surgery to remove several large veins in his legs. This is where his addiction began. This is where he found his unlimited supply of numbness. I was in middle school, and this is when I remember things being different. Things were changing. My dad stayed out with his friends a lot. He wasn't home for dinner anymore. When he was home, he was lying down sleepy and always said silly things. I would stay up late at night until he would get home, only to hear my mom and dad fighting, screaming, and my mom crying. Eventually I hated to hear the garage door open because I didn't want him to come home. Before my dad would take me to school, standing in his business suit with his briefcase, he would scarf down pills out of a little orange bottle. He would tip it back like he was eating a box of Nerds. I didn't know any better. My naive, my innocent mind didn't know what was happening. I couldn't comprehend that a doctor could be his drug dealer! They couldn't comprehend that because we have been taught to trust doctors. Things got worse. I started finding bottles of liquor and cans of beer hidden, and I passed it off. The 3 empty beers in the back of his company car: Oh, they must be his ``friends''. No one in our family drinks, definitely not my dad. I remember whole vacations, weekend trips, and afternoons ruined by his addiction. Mad fits of rage until one day my mom stood up and couldn't take it anymore. My dad got the help he needed, but how did he get the help? In hiding, in private--a local rehab facility. He was on a business trip. Our culture has stigmatized a group of people--a group of people who transcend race, status, gender--at the expense of their lives. This is a hidden killer. Drug abuse and drug addiction are hidden killers. So many of us have people in our families or close friends who don't want to talk about it. They are ashamed, and so it gets covered up and hidden away. As a result, we don't bring people out, let them know the effects, and cure them. She says: My dad was hurting. No, not from the wounds on his legs when he had his surgery but from depression and bipolar disorder. These are the roots of his addiction. They go hand in hand. When will we see this? When will we stop seeing addicts as a problem and see them as human beings and hurting? For the last 20 to 30 years, I have been in public life, and the Presiding Officer has been in public life a good bit. I always thought that anybody who fools with drugs is a criminal and should be put in jail. We have done that, and it hasn't solved a thing. It has gotten a lot worse. We have to rethink this issue. This is not a crime. Addiction is basically an illness. It needs to have a cure, and treatment is that cure. We have to face that. Senate Republicans and Democrats are looking at how to fix the sentencing guidelines, and I think it is encouraging and healthy for us to have these discussions. She says: Is it a selfish sickness? Of course it is. But how can we help them see the light when we push them aside? Because ``they asked for it?'' Just like a lady with skin cancer ``asked for it'' because she laid in a tanning bed? What if we treated addicts with the same compassion that we treat cancer patients? My father has been clean for almost a decade, and the demons of his addiction still haunt us all. No, we weren't homeless, nor did we have to face a death to be completely broken by this horrible epidemic, but I had a zombie for a father for my adolescence. I missed my childhood, years that we can never get back, memories that will never be erased, all because of a little orange pill bottle chased and hidden with a brown paper bag. Luckily, my story ends with a happy ending. I still have my dad. My story hasn't ended up the way so many do every day, like my two friends who didn't get help in time and passed away. I have stories from all over the country, and they are pathetic. I have a couple more I can read from West Virginia. I will go to different States. This is Erica's story. She says: Hello, My name is Erica and I am an addict. And I say that with great pride as I celebrated 10 years of recovery in November of 2015. I began using drugs here in West Virginia at the ripe age of 13. Thirteen seems to be that magic--adolescence. We are coming into adolescence. We are willing to experiment. We think we are invincible. We think nothing can harm us. Prescription drugs were easily accessible at that age and opened the door to 11 years of anguish, desperation, jails, and dirty needles. I came from a stable, drug- and alcohol- free home, but I was able to gain access to prescription drugs from my peers and my local middle school and high school on a daily basis. As my disease progressed, I dropped out of high school my freshman year and continued to put myself and family through years of pain and suffering. I attempted drug replacement therapy to control my opioid addiction, but that was only a temporary solution, and I eventually returned to drugs. Finally, I found myself in the court system and facing felony drug charges. It was then that I was able to find freedom through a 12-step fellowship. Today I can say I am a cum laude graduate of Marshall University, fully employed, homeowner, wife, and the mother of two wonderful West Virginia boys. I pray my children don't follow the path that, not only myself, but many of my West Virginians fall into. The disease of addiction is progressive and fatal if not treated or prevented. Here in West Virginia, we are leading the Nation in drug overdoses. And where I live in Cabell County, we have had over 900 overdoses in just the year of 2015. As a mother, I must trust our leaders to make responsible choices to help us seek solutions, gain back our communities, and save our children from following the same deadly path. I know the FDA was so proud that they came out with some new guidelines, and they said now they are going to start paying attention to the advisory committees. They didn't say they would adhere to their recommendations; they would just start paying attention to them. Also, the CDC--the Centers for Disease Control--put out some guidelines of how we should be prescribing, the knowledge we should have, how we should be administering, and what we should be doing to curb this drug abuse. And guess which agency fought against that and put it on delay? The FDA. The only thing I ask all of my colleagues to do is to please consider--just send a message with the vote you make tomorrow. It is not about the doctor at all. It is not about the person before us. It is about getting an advocate who will make a real change and make sure we fight this war. This story is another anonymous story: My brother is in his early 20s and was hired at the local plant that employs the majority of the county. He was injured on the job, saw his doctor, and was prescribed Lortab long term. Lortab, as I said before, is a schedule III, 90 days. You can keep calling it in, calling it in, and calling it in. As the effects from this started to wane, he was prescribed Xanax, Klonopin, and a variety of other prescription medicines. He then lost his good-paying job but found other work at a lower pay after almost a year of unemployment. This prescription med addiction continued for years, and once laws finally cracked down on prescribing narcotics, it left him unable to get all the medicines he had previously been prescribed. Once it became too expensive to buy them on the street, he turned to heroin. My fun-loving brother who was always at family functions, loved to be around his nieces and nephews, totally disappeared. I suspected that something more serious was going on, but he wouldn't answer calls or texts. In August, I hadn't seen him in several months. We have always been close. This was very unusual. I sent him a novel of a text since he wouldn't take my phone calls confronting him over the rumors that I had heard of his heroin use. He denied it. A few short weeks later, I got a call from my mother that he was transported to the hospital by ambulance but discharged a few hours later for chest pain. He later told us he had gotten a bad batch of heroin and was certain he was dying. He told the EMS he had used that morning, as well as hospital staff. I still to this day don't understand how someone can come in suffering from an overdose and be discharged a few hours later. People don't have knowledge. They are not being trained in this horrible epidemic that we have in this country. NOTHING was mentioned to him about treatment or rehab and he was treated as a [[Page S949]] lesser person. I was worried before, but after this was in a constant state of fear that I would get a call that my 31- year-old brother was dead. In October, he called me to tell me yes he was a heroin addict, but a new treatment center had opened near his home and he wanted to get clean. He asked if I would go with him, and I said of course yes. His insurance wouldn't cover a dime of this treatment. It would be all out of his pocket at $100 a day plus the cost of meds. For someone working at a $30,000 or less a year job, paying for housing, utilities, food, (he never did receive public assistance)-- He was too proud for that-- this cost was more than he could do. Again I told him I would be there and pay for whatever he couldn't. I convinced him he needed more of a support system than just me and he finally told our parents. We were we were raised in church and came from a large religious family. He was so ashamed of what he had become he didn't want the family to know and the majority of them still don't know to this day. I am hoping, as this letter was written anonymously, eventually he will share this with the family, maybe preventing other members from going down this road. He will tell them when he is ready. My mom and I went with him to his first appointment at the suboxyne clinic, and one of us has been at every appointment since. It is wonderful-- he has a session with a psychiatrist at every visit. It's more than prescribing meds. They are doing the counseling to make sure their patients get clean. I am proud to say that after only four months, not only is he clean but he has weaned off the suboxyne. He still goes for counseling and has the nurse's cell that he can call 24 hours a day if he's having a hard day. In the future he wants to tell his story and help others facing the same crisis. Madam President, I have been reading stories of people addicted all over the State of West Virginia. I have stories from your State also, Madam President. I would like to read that for you. This is in New Hampshire--Sandown, NH. This is Kathleen's story. I am sure she has sent you the same copy she sent me. She wants her name to be known. My name is Kathleen Stephens. I am a 56 year old RN, BSN, from Sandown, NH. I am currently the Director of Clinical Service at a nationwide hospice company. My story is much like thousands of others out there, pretty average, fairly normal. I have two children; a 33-year-old son who graduated with a degree in Mathematics from Boston University and a 31- year-old daughter who graduated with a psychology degree from Assumption College. I myself have a Bachelor of Science and Nursing degree and my children's father a Bachelor's degree in business from Wharton School of Business in PA. I give you this detailed background for to you see that we are a well educated and successful family. We are a white, mid to upper middle class who have always lived in a beautiful neighborhood surrounded by loving families whose children played outside, joined peewee soccer, little league, softball, basketball and girl scouts to name but a few. We were the home in the neighborhood where all the children loved to play. We took our children to drive in movies, camping, the beach, museums and always visited their grandparents. We were normal, that's all, or what we perceived was normal. When speaking with our children now, they both recount wonderful childhoods and deem themselves ``lucky.'' Our house was filled with love. I hugged my kids all the time, never hesitated to demonstrate to or tell them how much I loved them. They had grandparents who were always around, who also demonstrated love for them. About 5 years ago, my daughter, and her boyfriend, an Intern at Tufts Medical School decided, after being together for 2 years that they would move to Sacramento. I was devastated inside but encouraged my daughter to follow her heart. Over the subsequent years, our communications went from daily to weekly to scattered. Each conversation seemed more distant than the last. We saw her an average of twice a year; most significantly, when we paid her expenses to come home for Christmas. Her boyfriend never came; he distanced himself from us almost immediately. I'm sure at this point you know the story. About 18 months ago I finally confronted my daughter asking what was wrong, seeing her go from a loving daughter to a distant person I no longer knew. Over the previous few years, she turned into a virtual stranger. I told her I loved her no matter what and that I would be there for her. At that time she denied any issue. A few weeks later she was in the hospital and called me. Apparently, she had hit bottom. She confided that she was a heroin addict. I was more than shocked. She had been in a substance free dorm in college, hated drinking, drugs and was pretty straight laced overall. I kept myself in check saying that no matter what I would support her, asked her to come home so we could help her. She confided that it started with a prescription for opioids that her boyfriend had shared with her. He was given one for back pain years before, got hooked and decided she might just like it. So, amazingly she did come home, but she went back a few months later. She then returned to get clean again and went back a few months later. She overdosed multiple times, of which I knew nothing until recently. Her boyfriend gave her IV heroin while she was in the hospital being treated for pneumonia to keep her habit going. He was the one, I found out later, that he shot her up because she hated doing it. He had developed a hold on her that was a bond of heroin high. I knew the drug had gotten her when, due to the stress of everything happening, I ended up in the hospital ruling out a heart attack. She drove me there, dropped me off and went to get high (I found out later). I ended up being fine, stress of course, and she ended up going back home yet again. She stayed clean after going into a rehab, which kicked her out after 8 days because her insurance was declined. She then attended NA-- Narcotics Anonymous-- meetings almost daily and got a job that she loved. In the meantime, her boyfriend was found out through a ``random'' drug test and suspended. She was clean for 4 months, the happiest four months of my life. We spoke every few days, or texted. Her voice was truly hers again . . . her laughter, her expressions, her humor. I felt she was finally back with us. She had left her boyfriend and went into a sober living home. Life was good and I was so grateful to have my daughter, my best friend, back. About 3 months into her sobriety she decided to reach out and try to get her boyfriend sober as well, the beginning of the end. At exactly month 4 she went to his house and he had a ``surprise'' for her. She was new in her sobriety, just once she said, and she fell back down the rabbit hole. I knew when she didn't return my calls or texts that it was bad. But finally she responded; she was back into it again, but she'd get out she promised. The next 8 months were a few weeks clean then back into drugs again. I did not send her money. Honestly, she never asked. She knew I'd never support her habit. Around Thanksgiving 2015 she had had it. She called me and said she wanted to get back into rehab and leave her boyfriend permanently. Her life was no longer worth living. Weeks of trying to get her into rehab went unsuccessfully when we finally found Clean and Sober in Sacramento. At that point she was clean two weeks, had slowly packed up or sold her belongings and was ready for the break. But she had to sneak out to get away from her very controlling, manipulative partner; and she did. The happy part: She is today 60 days sober. She has a new job (She had been fired from the other one), which she loves. She blocked her boyfriend from her phone, her email and her facebook. She is the daughter, once again, that I know and love, but I love her regardless of the disease of addiction. Love the addict, hate the disease. And for right now I thank God, pray alot, and take it one day at a time. I have another one here I want to share with you. The thing I wanted to share, Madam President, is this: My State and your State have probably been hit as hard as any two States in the country. We have people coming to us all the time. We are fighting every way we can. We are introducing pieces of legislation. We are not worrying about who is Republican or Democrat. How can we help Americans--the beautiful people in New Hampshire, the wonderful people in West Virginia, who are facing more deaths, more disease, more destruction to the family? I want to share with you that when I first got elected--Senator Byrd had died in 2010. I was Governor of the State of West Virginia. I had to make a decision. I thought maybe I could come to Washington and help with the experiences I had and what I had seen in my State and times. We had challenges. After I was elected to the Senate, I had gone back to Oceana, WV. At that time it had been called ``Oxyana'' because drug use was so rampant in this beautiful town. I remembered this town because when I was a freshman in college, my roommate was from this town. It was the most beautiful town I had been in. They had everything. What a privilege it would have been to grow up in this beautiful town, but I could see many years later it was not the town I knew or remembered in my mind. I went to the middle school. These were all children in fifth to eighth grade. I tried to give pep talks. I wanted to get them involved and tell them how good they could be, how much we are counting on them, what they need to get a good education and contribute something back to society, and how fortunate and lucky they are to be in this little town. After I finished speaking--they were attentive and cooperative--there was a group of them. They asked: Can we talk to you privately? I will never forget this. These were 12- and 13-year-old [[Page S950]] boys and girls. There had to be six or seven of them. I went in the back room and sat at a table. They started talking and telling me their stories. These were stories they had watched and were telling me. This was the first time I had ever heard from a child up close and personal who said: My dad worked at the mines. He had a back problem. He got hurt. They kept giving him pills. We lost our house. Mom and dad were fighting. They got divorced. We lost everything. I've got nothing now. My grandparents were watching me while I was trying to take care of us. My dad is an addict. I heard these stories from these five kids. They were all pleading. Now fast forward to the year 2015. I go back to the same school. These kids that were 12 years old are now seniors in high school. The same group wants to talk to me. They had lived a clean life, but I think about what they have gone through and what they have seen. Then I sit down with another group of 12- and 13-year-olds from the same area. They are telling me stories about how they are watching their lives before them when they watch a boyfriend or a stepfather because the family had broken apart, the mother remarried or whatever, and the person that she is with is a drug addict. This little child watches her mother get shot up and killed because of the drugs the boyfriend shoots into the mother. Can you imagine a 12- or 13-year-old having to live with this and see this happen in their home? What we are asking is simply for the Food and Drug Administration to change, to be the watchdog to help us. They are supposed to protect us. They don't say: I did my job. The pharmaceutical company told me they made this drug, and this is the way it was made. This is what it was supposed to do. We checked it out. Everything is fine; leave it on the market. You are not looking at the welfare of the people. You know what it does. You know it is addictive. We have no treatment centers. We are doing nothing to treat this. We are not challenging these pharmaceutical companies who are good companies. They do a lot of good and put a lot of products out there that are very good, but they are bringing these opiates on the market quicker than ever before, more powerful than ever before, and they know what is going to happen. I am challenging all of them. I think the FDA should challenge them. We are not going to approve more opiates. We are not going to let you bring on the market stronger opiates that we know are addictive and will ruin people's lives. If they will do that and challenge these companies to come out with new research and development that can scientifically give us relief needed for people who have chronic pain without making them addicts who lose their lives--we should be able to do that in this great country. I am going to read you a story from Kentucky, my next door neighbor, the majority leader's home--Kentucky and West Virginia. This is Emily from Louisville, KY. My name is Emily Walden. I am a mother who lost my 21-year- old son to a drug overdose in 2012. My son TJ came from a good family, was a member of the Kentucky National Guard and the most respectful young man you could have ever met. TJ made an initial poor decision that led to an addiction to the drug Opana; he had unlimited access to this drug during that time. TJ did not want to die from this. He tried very hard to overcome his addiction and I tried very hard to save his life. I started researching the drug Opana about five years ago and would like to share with you what I have learned that illustrates the need for changes to our FDA policies and approval processes for all opioid drugs. The drug Opana contains the opioid Oxymorphone which was removed from the market in 1979 due to the overdose deaths and addiction this drug was causing across our country. In 2002, the FDA started holding IMMPACT meetings every year allowing pharmaceutical companies to pay money to be included in discussions and changes to clinical trials, design. We call that pay to play--the impact it has because they are able to go to these types of settings and get absolute front row seats with the people they are trying to persuade to take another look at these drugs that might have been taken off the market because they were deemed too dangerous. This is allowed to go on. It has been going on for far too long, and the FDA is part of it. This is part of the change that needs to be made and made immediately. Endo Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Opana, attended each one of these ``pay-to-play'' meetings. In 2003, Endo Pharmaceuticals brought the drug Opana to the FDA for approval and was denied due to the overdoses that occurred during the clinical trials. In 2006, Endo Pharmaceuticals again brought the drug Opana to the FDA for approval but this time using new clinical trial that applied a modified process, called ``Enriched Enrollment,'' which removed patients with preexisting opiate sensitivities from the trial. The Enriched Enrollment process skews results and seriously underestimates risks associated with the proposed drug involved in the clinical trial. In addition, the FDA ignored their own review guidance by bypassing their advisory committee and approved Opana for moderate to severe pain. At the time Opana was approved, our country was already experiencing an explosion of overdose deaths and addiction from the overprescribing and misrepresentation of the safety of opiates. In addition to causing thousands of deaths and addiction, the approved use of Opana has now been directly implicated in an outbreak of Hepatitis C and HIV cases in the State of Indiana. The FDA has continued to use Enriched Enrollment-- Or pay to play-- to approve new opiates and override or bypass altogether their advisory committee for new opiate approvals and for new uses of opiates further contributing to the overdose deaths and addiction. These process changes must stop. The year after my son died I traveled to Washington DC for the first time in my life and was very fortunate to be able to meet with the then Senate Minority Leader-- Now Senate majority leader-- Senator McConnell, the next year I had nine meetings which included a meeting with then acting Director Botticelli of ONDCP, DEA Administrator Michelle Leonhart and seven meetings with Senator's staff. In 2015 I had thirteen meetings scheduled. I am not going away! We need change to curb this horrible epidemic that started with prescribed opiates and the mistakes that were made need to be corrected. How many people have to die? How many more people have to become addicted? The FDA is sending the wrong message to physicians by continuing to approve opioids during the worst drug epidemic our country has ever faced. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator's postcloture time has expired. Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous consent to continue. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Madam President. The FDA is supposed to be protecting public health and yet over 200,000 people have died and they have failed to put appropriate restrictions on these dangerous drugs to prevent overdose deaths. I want to know why there is one death from something such as ecoli and every head of lettuce is pulled from the shelves in ten different states but opioids have killed thousands of people and they are considered safe and effective? How can that be? When is the FDA going to put human life before the paychecks of Big Pharma? What will it take? A million deaths? We need an FDA commissioner that will protect the citizens of this country that is willing to take the overall best interest of public safety into consideration and not allow the pharmaceutical companies to have him in their back pockets. My son TJ had a lifelong dream of joining the military and fighting for his country. He would have given his life to protect and serve. He was one of the most patriotic young men and his country failed him. Please do the right thing. Please do not let one more mother get a knock on her door saying their child is gone and that they will never [ever] come home [again]. There is no greater pain than burying your child! My son, my precious child with the most beautiful blue eyes, caring and loving heart, died in part by the greed of big Pharma and-- Most importantly-- the carelessness of the FDA. It is time for change! Another story from Kentucky. This is in Northern Kentucky and this is Kimberly's story. My name is Kimberly Wright. I am a [mother from Northern Kentucky] who works in the trenches to save the lives of people in my Community. NKY was hit by a pill epidemic around 2000. That pill Epidemic has now turned into a Heroin Epidemic. Since 2013 the death toll continues to climb. In 2015 we have had 1,168 overdose reverses. We still await the number of deaths. Our entire system is on the verge of collapse--our Courts, Police, Children's Services, Jails. Our jails currently have 99% Heroin and Pill cases housed in the jails. Our Treatment system is seriously strained with not 1 new bed added in the last 10 years since this epidemic started. We are in a War in [Northern Kentucky]. Every day we wait to see how many died that day. We have people getting in their cars driving high on pills and Heroin wrecking into innocent people and killing them. This is the United States of America and this is a shame. We allow the FDA and Big Pharma to profit off the deaths of an entire generation of young people. We are in effect losing 2 jumbo jets full of kids every day [[Page S951]] in America due to Pills and Heroin. We need help. We are begging for help to stop this madness. Our American families are losing our children at an alarming rate to overprescribing Drs and Big Pharma. We beg you, please help us stop this. I lost my sister Alicia Cook on October 26, 2010, to an overdose. Alicia was a nurse with 2 young daughters. This Epidemic has no boundaries and it's in every community in the Country. Northern Kentucky has the highest rates of HEPC, surpassing the National Level, due to heroin and pills being injected. We have a high rate of homeless children due to their parents being dead or drug addicted with no end in sight. We have 52% of grandparents raising their grandchildren due to death and addiction. This is a nightmare for parents. When our children were born we could have never imagined this would be our life. You don't sleep at night from the anxiety of wondering if you are the next parent to get that call that your child has overdosed. It's like being in a constant panic attack. It's not normal to grieve the loss of a child who is alive, for they are truly lost. I [know lots of] parents who have lost their child and I can't imagine their pain and grief. I grieve for my addicted 26- year-old daughter who is in the fight of her life [because of] her Addiction. I watch her destroying herself every day. I don't want to join the mothers who have lost their child to this Epidemic. I know how I suffer now and I just can't go there. I will continue to fight for my community. Will you [please] join me? That is Arlene's story. Indiana is one of the States that has been hit so hard also. This is Danielle's story from Southern Indiana. My name is Danielle McCowan. I live in southern Indiana and work as a server. About 2 and a half years ago a customer by the name of Josh Harvey left me his number. At the time he told me he was living in Chicago for school. Little did I know he was in rehab there. Granted, I didn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in constant contact. Over a year or so ago I found out about his heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know it started out with prescription pills and later went to heroin when the pills became harder to get. He served a month in jail in Michigan for the entire month of this past July over a heroin related charge. He came home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. Luckily, his dad saved him that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient program doing better. Or so we all thought. School let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came to me on November the 4th telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. I suggested an in-patient program. He went to Wellstone after he left my house. He sat for several hours and finally was given a room. I went and checked on him 2 different times while he waited to make sure he was there. Thursday I didn't receive any calls. Friday nothing either. Then Saturday morning, the 7th of November, his mother called me to break my heart. He had passed away that Friday, the 6th, over in Louisville and didn't know who to contact until that Saturday morning, I guess. He had checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into his house, took his Xbox which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. Never in a million years did I think I'd become close to anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn't discriminate. It can get ahold of any and everybody. Never in my life have I been so depressed or heartbroken. All I want is his story shared. He was my happy ending gone away too soon. They continue. They continue on, these stories, the heartaches and the lives destroyed, lives changed. Few too many lives are saved. Massachusetts. As the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Markey has been working with me very closely and all of us on this horrible epidemic that we have. This is Sara's story. She is from Amherst, MA. My nuclear family is middle class or the working poor, but it is blended in that I was raised by my mother and step-dad, but my bio father's side of the family would be considered well-off. Heroin first came to my radar after my brother Donny became addicted to pain pills after surgery, and heroin followed suit after RX's stopped. Then it seemed like it was everywhere around me: my nephew, my niece. Then we lost my cousin Cory, who passed in a sober house for his addiction to alcohol, along with a needle and an empty bag next to him. Cory is an example of a young man institutionalized by multiple incarcerations and just when he would try to lift himself up, in he would go again. He was trying to get clean for his girlfriend and unborn child when he passed away, and he was happy, thinking he was getting better. Living with someone close who struggles and then multiply that by two, and adolescence, young adulthood mixed in, and you have my descent as an empathetic aunt who felt powerless to change anything. Then the bottom dropped out. My cousin, John Ahern, passed at the end of August after a long period of recovery alone in the woods. It didn't matter he came from privilege or was the nicest person I had every known in my life for so long. He leaves behind three loving sons. They both couldn't access the help they needed at various stages, including recovery, and died alone. It is my mission to stand up for them and the young people like my niece who began her struggle at 14, and now approaching 18 has some clean time. There are no support programs in my community for this age group, and especially for non-White young people like my niece and nephew. They are both of Latino descent. Please do something. People are begging us everywhere in this country to help them, and basically it starts with treating this as an illness and not as a crime. It starts also with having clinics, having basic places where we can serve them and help them get clean. They cannot do it by themselves, and they are the first to tell you. The stories I am reading here exemplify that so well. I have a Florida story here, and Florida has also been ravaged. Florida was a problem that we had in West Virginia because of the pill mills there. People would take the bus down or they could take a cheap flight down to Florida, buy all the pills they could and come back. Florida has been very helpful in the last years trying to stop the pill epidemic. This is Janet from Fort Lauderdale. Dear Senator Manchin. I appreciate you taking the time to stop the appointment of Dr. Califf from becoming the FDA commissioner. I founded STOPPnow--Stop the Organized Pill Pushers now--due to all the drug-addicted babies I was caring for as a neonatal intensive care nurse at a children's hospital in Broward County, FL. We started holding protests in front of the 150 pill mills that were in Broward County alone. Many parents came out to protest with us. Parents from all over the country contacted us as well. Too many parents are crying themselves to sleep over the loss of their child. At first, there were no consequences for either the clinic owner or the doctor. Then they started arresting the doctors for money laundering. Our State's attorney has called the doctors drug dealers in white coats. The Board of Medicine is not protecting the public by allowing high-prescribing doctors to keep their license. Therefore, the plight of the drug-addicted babies and the devastation to the families continues to rise. When one clinic owner was arrested, he was earning $150,000 a day. I repeat, $150,000 a day. Not one doctor in that clinic to date has lost his license or his practice. We only have the judicial system helping to alleviate this in Florida. Doctors are now being charged with first-degree murder. It would be kinder for a doctor to lose his license than to sit in a courtroom at their own murder trial. We have been unsuccessful in our efforts for lawmakers to mandate that prescribers use the prescription drug monitoring program in Florida. Yet in this environment, there is a bill passing through the committees allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe narcotics without a doctor signing off on the order. I would support this bill if they included the mandate. And, of course, the FDA approved that children as young as 11 years old can be prescribed OxyContin. We definitely need an investigation. Madam President, as you can see, these are problems that we have all over the country. This is not just your State and not just my State. I know it is hard. They say we need someone in there, so let's just go ahead and confirm Dr. Califf. Dr. Califf is an honorable man. He is still there. He is going to be there. He has been there for 1 year. In the 1 year that he has been there, we have basically put more opiate drugs on the market without even going through a clinical overview. If that change were going to come, it would have come by now. I am sure he could have had input, and I would hope that he would. Dr. Califf has called a lot of our colleagues and said that these changes will be coming. This Senator will tell you the changes they recommended when they said they were going to make changes. They said: We are going to make sure that we are going to start listening to our staff and people who are reviewing these drugs. They are going to listen to them, but there is no mandate that they will have to follow. This Senator has a piece of legislation that the Presiding Officer coauthored, and I appreciate that very much. Basically what we are saying is this: When you have your advisory committee--and every drug must go through an advisory committee's opinion, and if they recommend as they did with Zohydro to not let it go on the market, that cannot be bypassed, neglected, or pushed aside. Our bill would basically state that they must bring it to the people's representatives in Congress and state why it is so very important for them to bring this new high- powered drug to the market--as if we don't have enough. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population but consumes 80 [[Page S952]] percent of these addictive opiate drugs. Something is wrong. Something must change. I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to be able to read the letters of people who have been affected by this all over this great country in all of our States. I know we feel the pain, and we are going to try to make these changes and make sure this agency will do what it is supposed to do. I yield the floor. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.",package_114_144.csv,77187,77187,77258,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [senate] [pages s943-s952] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] guantanamo detainees mr. roberts. mr. president, i rise today to speak about president obama's plan to move guantanamo bay terrorists to the united states. however, it is not much of a plan. with all due respect, it is more of a failed attempt to fulfill a campaign promise and, in my view, what he believes will secure his legacy. fortunately for us--those who believe that moving dangerous enemy combatants within our communities is dangerous, irresponsible, and an illogical idea--the president's plan contains nothing really substantive. in fact, it fails to recommend an alternative location to any current facility at all. as a matter of fact, i call that a win. the plan does not provide any intelligence to substantiate the president's claims, nor does it even provide a chart or a graph to support the mathematics on the alleged cost savings, and there is no estimate regarding the cost to [[page s944]] local and state governments to support such a move. indeed, the 9-page report is short in every regard. the white house received the department of defense's results of their site surveys and other data regarding a potential closing last month. and this--i am holding up the report here--this is all we have in return: 9 pages. i know the chairman of the senate armed services committee, my good friend and colleague, senator john mccain, is not going to be pleased with the lack of substance or data or the articulation of a real plan. the same goes for senator richard burr, chairman of the intelligence committee, who at this particular time is going to be introducing legislation of his own to provide intelligence with regard to the administration's lack of intelligence on moving detainees to the united states. the lack of a plan and the inability of this administration to provide an alternative site indicate that none of the sites visited by dod's survey team met the demands necessary to hold detainees and, more important, keep our community safe. the fact that no site was named and no substance on those visits was provided tells me there is no alternative to match what we are now doing safely and securely at gitmo, period. this so-called plan, as outlined by the president in his speech today from the white house, skims over four steps to closing guantanamo bay. first, it articulates the administration's plan to continue moving detainees designated for transfer by the president's national security team to foreign countries. in some instances, this may have been successful with regard to individuals being rehabilitated, but a third of the time, detainees transferred to third-party host countries have returned to the battlefield. and these are just the ones we know about. this is called recidivism, and the rates are too high for this process to be called ``secure and responsible,'' as the administration has labeled it. second, the administration plans to continue its review of the threat posed by those detainees who are not currently eligible for transfer through the periodic review board. this is to provide a new review on the current population of detainees who have been deemed too dangerous to transfer--deemed too dangerous to transfer, and yet this president wants to give them a second shot at getting out. this doesn't make any sense. terrorists are not criminals. as much as this president would like for you to believe they are, terrorists are not equal to the inmates we have across america's prison system. they are fixated on the destruction of america. they have no regard for life, not that of their own and especially not the lives of innocent civilians. the report hones in on having a detainee population anywhere from 30 to 60. there seems to be an assumption on the part of the president that the review board will determine that half of those deemed too dangerous for transfer or release are suddenly safe for transfer or release. does the president believe this is possible or does this assumption simply serve his own means to create cost savings for his plan that can never be realized? the plan also fails to account for the fact that our nation is still mired in the war on terrorism. we are still fighting in the middle east and worldwide, including the united states of america, to ensure that terrorism does not prevail. what about the individuals we detain from this day forward? what about those individuals with critical information related to the next terrorist threat? how can we operate without a facility like guantanamo bay to hold terrorists we take off the battlefield? third, the plan attempts to identify individual dispositions, one by one, for those who remain designated for continued law of war detention, to include article iii, military commissions, or foreign prosecutions. what a muddle. in his remarks today, president obama advocated for trying terrorist suspects in article iii courts. the president named two american citizens--faisal shahzad and dzhokhar tsarnaev--to articulate his point. both of those individuals, however, were apprehended in the united states, not on the battlefield. the intent of the guantanamo detention facility is to protect the american people by removing terrorists from the battlefield. as the united states faces a growing threat from terrorist organizations, such as isis, which have tens of thousands of members, bringing those terrorists to the united states to stand trial simply cannot be the answer. it is not safe for the american people and irresponsible to our national security. fourth, the plan states the administration's desire to ``work with congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' that is in quotes, ``work with congress.'' well, there is something that is unique with the president, ``work with congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' but it does not anywhere in its nine pages endorse a specific facility to house guantanamo detainees; rather, the plan describes a prototype for a detention facility in the united states--not kansas, not colorado, not south carolina, not anywhere in the united states. the president's long-awaited plan is to work with congress to identify the most appropriate location as soon as possible, according to the summary provided to my office by the department of defense. question: how could it take 7 years to arrive at the idea to work with congress? what a novel idea, but only for this express purpose. if the president had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in this plan. if he had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in 2009 when we stopped his plan the first time. further, the plan fails to substantiate president obama's repeated claims that guantanamo bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists. let me repeat this. the plan fails to substantiate president obama's repeated claims that guantanamo bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists, a rallying point for terrorist attacks, hindering relations with allies, and draining department of defense resources. my goodness. i wrote defense secretary ash carter in november to ask for intelligence reports or data to support many of these assertions. i asked secretary carter if an intelligence assessment has been done in conjunction with the site surveys recently conducted by the department of defense from the safety of our community's standpoint. i asked for the department's rationale for evaluating fort leavenworth, when three previous evaluations have made it abundantly clear it is and continues to be an unacceptable alternative. i asked if there were intelligence products regarding previous site evaluations at fort leavenworth. the administration has argued that guantanamo is a recruiting tool for terrorists. so i logically asked for an intelligence assessment to support that argument. as a follow on, i asked what assessment had been done to reflect that guantanamo has increased terrorist recruitment. and finally, was there any empirical data to support the administration's argument that national security threats will decrease if enemy combatants are held in the united states? common sense will tell you that it would increase. two months later, the response confirmed my assumptions. the department of defense had no intelligence products--none. there were no intelligence products, no data to provide to support the president's argument that gtmo serves as a recruiting tool and that moving detainees to the mainland would increase security and decrease the terrorist threat to the united states. my colleagues, this plan really confirms what many of us already know: there is no safe alternative to gtmo--not in kansas, not in colorado, not in south carolina. nowhere on the mainland is there a secure and responsible alternative. if there were, this president would not have failed to articulate it in his plan. mr. president, a plan that is a legacy speech does not safeguard the lives of the american people. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from west virginia. mr. manchin. mr. president, are we in morning business? the presiding officer. we are postcloture on the nomination. mr. manchin. i wish to speak on the nomination of the food and drug administration, dr. robert califf. [[page s945]] the presiding officer. without objection, the senator is recognized. mr. manchin. mr. president, i believe the fda needs new leadership, a new focus and a new culture, and dr. robert califf's past involvement with the pharmaceutical industry reflects that he will not be this person. he will not have the impact or leadership capabilities the nation needs to stem the tide of the opioid crisis we have all over this country, even in your great state of oklahoma and my state of west virginia, which has been ravaged by this. i would like to put this in context for a little bit. he has been there over a year--a good man. i am not speaking about his ability, his honesty, his integrity, his education, his background, and all the good work he has done. but he has been there for a year, and for the past 20 years dr. califf basically has come from the institutional research side, from education, and with that, his support has come from the pharmaceutical industries, those that are putting opioids on the market. i just feel it would be hard, human naturewise, for him to change and rule to keep these products from coming onto the market. so to put this in context, this is not personally about dr. califf. this is about the culture he comes from and the year he has been there as the no. 2 man and what has happened during that period of time. let me go over some things. over the last decade, the fda has approved new drugs at historically high rates. in 2008, companies filing applications to sell never-before-marketed drugs were denied 66 percent of the time. they were denied 66 percent of the time. yet between the beginning of 2015 and august of 2015, the fda rejected only 3 uses for new chemical entities and approved 25. that is an approval rate of 89 percent. now, tell me how in 7 short years that culture changed to where anything and everything coming at us was passed through, when we have already become the most addicted country on earth. if one looks at new drugs and not the use of drugs, they have rejected only 1 and approved 23. that is a 96-percent approval rate in 2015. so of the new drugs that came to the market, only 1 was rejected--a 96-percent approval rate. in 2008, the fda's approval of new marketing claims for existing drugs was 56 percent. in the first 8 months of 2015, it was 88 percent. this includes approving oxycontin for children as young as 11. the fda's 2013 approval of zohydro drew widespread concern. all of us were outraged when we heard this new drug came on the market. to put another time period in context, i had worked for 3 years to try to get all opioids from a schedule iii to a schedule ii so doctors could prescribe only for 30 days. you had to go back and see your doctor. up until that time, vicodin and lortab--the two most widely prescribed opioids--were schedule iii. that means you could get a 90- day prescription and then call in to get it refilled. they were going out like m&ms. we were able to do that, and no sooner did we get that done--and it took 3 years, when it should have been 3 weeks. within the same week that all opioids got to us from a schedule iii to a schedule ii, they approved a new drug called zohydro, which was 10 times more powerful than vicodin or lortab--much more powerful. that approval was done against their advisory committee 11 to 2. that means 13 experts evaluated this drug and said: it is not needed, too powerful, don't do it. guess what, they did it anyway. now they are saying that they are not going to pay attention to the advisory committee. not only did they say they are not going to pay attention to the advisory committee, but we have had the decision on oxycontin being given to 11-year-old children; we have had the two new drugs that came out in 2014 after zohydro and the pushback from senators representing our respective states; they had a new drug called targiniq, which is an extended-release oxycontin product, and hysingla, which is an extended-release hydrocodone product. so there were three new decisions made, with two new powerful opioids coming to the market and the decision that oxycontin would be given to 11-year-olds. that was done without any review from the advisory committee. they got so much pushback from zohydro, they said: we are not going down this path again. we will just not have anybody review it. we will just go ahead and do it. if you believe that is a culture that will protect the welfare and well-being of our citizens in our states all through this great country of ours, then i am sorry because i don't. i am sorry, but that is why i have been so passionate. i have more people dying of legal prescription drug abuse than anything else in the state of west virginia. more people die. it is ravaging families. i have personal letters i will read, and they will tear your heart out with what is happening and how this grips and tears people apart. it tears communities apart. every law enforcement agency in america will tell you--no matter what town they are in, what county they are in, or what state they are in--that over 80 percent and upward of 95 percent of all crimes committed are drug related, are some sort of drug related. there is not one of us right now in this beautiful senate chamber that doesn't know somebody in our immediate family or senate family that hasn't been affected by drugs, either prescription legal drugs or illegal drugs. it is awful. it is an epidemic. i believe the fda must break its cozy relationship with the pharmaceutical industry and instead start a relationship with the millions of americans. i have said that i am going to fight against the fda protecting a business plan and hopefully the culture will change, and they will start protecting america and the plan of families and citizens of this great country to have a healthy lifestyle. it is because of this belief that i am urging my colleagues to vote against the confirmation of dr. robert califf as the director of the food and drug administration. he will still be there and still be a valuable person. he is just not that person with the passion to change the culture in this important agency. we have let this sleeping giant go for far too long. my office has been absolutely flooded, mr. president, with stories from west virginians--but i have received them from all over the country--who want their voices to be heard. they say: please use my name. i am not ashamed. we have been hiding too long. i have watched too many people's lives be destroyed. so today i will read letters not only from west virginians but also people across this great country of ours that have been impacted by the opioid abuse epidemic. i urge my colleagues to listen to these letters from their states and stories from my state about these drugs before confirming dr. califf, and in all good conscience make that decision tomorrow when we vote. do you really believe he can bring the changes needed and not just say: well, we have to have somebody there. he is already there. he will do a good job where he is; he is just not going to be able to kick them and shake them up and say we are not going down this path any more. there are some good people. we have made some recommendations of some good people who would bring the cultural changes that need to be brought. i am going to read first about a young lady from southern west virginia. her name is chelsea. this is her story. as a recovering addict, i have watched myself, my friends, and loved ones suffer from this horrible thing we call addiction. as i watch all these people now suffering, i know they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, and neither did i. whether it be for pain or just simply hanging with the wrong people like i did, we all have one thing in common, we chose to do drugs for the first time. someone made a decision to do drugs for the first time. growing up, i can honestly say i had what most people would call a normal childhood. chelsea comes from an upper socioeconomic family in southern west virginia. she continues: i was raised by two hardworking parents who would and will still do anything for me. i was a gymnast and a cheerleader for most of my life and went to church every wednesday and sunday. my dad was even the mayor of madison at one point. but even being raised up in a good home did not stop me from doing drugs. so this has no socioeconomic bearing. it does not. it is not a partisan issue. whether you are a democrat or [[page s946]] republican, it makes no difference. rich or poor makes no difference. chelsea continues: i can still remember the first time i heard about someone getting high. i was in the 6th grade and became friends with a girl whose parents got high themselves. we would walk about the playground and she would talk of these things called ``drugs.'' as she talked day in and day out about how getting high made her feel, it made me start to wonder what this thing called ``getting high'' was really about. now, mind you, i am talking about a 12-year-old girl. she was just 12 years old. i can remember thinking how cool i thought it was that her parents had done drugs with her and would party with her. so another friend of hers, also 12 years old, had parents who were doing drugs with her and would party with her. chelsea continues: one weekend i went to her house to stay the night and this was the first time i had gotten high. we smoked some pot, drank some alcohol, and i was turned on to my first pill around the age of 12. from this day forward, my life would forever be changed. from the ages twelve to fifteen i partied some on the weekends and sometimes during the week, but as time went on my addiction and tolerance grew more and more. by this time, i was doing more pills because i had access to them. between stealing lortabs off my dad, to hanging with that girl so we could get high with her dad, to buying pills off the local drug dealer on the street, i had moved from doing them every now and then to every day. i would stay a lot of weekends at this girl's house just to get high because my parents would never have done that nor did they know i was doing it. by sixteen my life took another turn. my grandmother, who i called nana, had taken care of me most of my life while my mother worked. she was diagnosed with lung cancer two years prior. in the last days of her life, i would visit her in the hospital and she would tell me how proud she was of me and how i was her little model. i had also met a very special guy by the name of j.r. a few months before this who i spent a lot of time with. on july 18, 2003, my nana passed away. on the day of her wake, j.r. took me out to dinner, and on the way home he asked me to go meet his dad. i explained to him i could not and that my grandma's funeral was the next day. he dropped me off that night, kissed me good-bye, and that was the last time i ever heard from j.r. twenty minutes after he left me, he wrecked and died. i felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. the day of his funeral is the next time i met the love of my life that would soon try to destroy my life. it was called oxycontin. i fell in love immediately with oxycontin. it took all of my cares and worries away, and from that moment on all i wanted to do was be numb. as the years passed, my drug addiction grew worse. i was not only doing pain pills, i was now experimenting with all kinds of other things. i can still remember my senior week in high school. while everyone was excited about going to the beach, i had to make sure i had enough drugs to go and not be sick. i took roxy's and oxy's, pretty much anything i could get my hands on, and eight balls of cocaine. by this time in my life i didn't care about anything. it never once had crossed my mind that if i got caught with all of that i could go to jail. i was just worried about my next high. the following months were the same. i was doing anything i could to get my hands on drugs, from pain pills to cocaine to meth. i did not care as long as i was high. i was hanging around with people who were as sick as i was and places that i look back now that i would not even take my dog. at 19 i met a guy who would fuel my drug addiction even more. he was 40 years old and dealt oxycontin. at this point i could not afford my habit, so i did what i had to do. i started seeing my drug dealer. my life soon went from bad to worse. i had oxycontin 80s any time i wanted them, and at the time i thought life can't get any better than this. when you are doing eight to ten oxycontin 80s a day, you will do whatever it takes to get them. at this point i was turned on to heroin. heroin would have taken my life if it hadn't scared me so much. the high from heroin is so intense that anyone who had done it would have fallen in love. but, actually, it scared the life out of me. as time passed and i wasn't getting high like i wanted to anymore from snorting oxycontin, i decided to start shooting up. that is one thing i never thought i would do is shoot up. i always told myself that people who shot up were the homeless people on the streets, complete and utter trash. now here i was sticking a needle in my arm to get what i wanted. and to be honest, i thought life was bad before. it just got a whole lot worse. the life i was and the life that i knew was gone, and oxycontin was completely ruling my life now. oxycontin is a legal drug made by a legal pharmaceutical that knew exactly the effects this would have when they put this on the market over 20 years ago. she said: what stood before everyone was pure addiction. i had started stealing off of everyone by now and didn't care who i hurt. people's priceless possessions that meant so much to them meant nothing to me. all i'd seen was my next fix. that's all i could see. people were bringing me stolen stuff and i was taking it to the nearest pawn shop or my drug dealer. i had no shame. i had needle marks all up and down my arms, and i would lie to my family about how they got there. it was like i had no conscience, or, better yet, my addiction was my conscience. eventually i got caught stealing and was charged with 17 different felonies and one misdemeanor. this still did not slow me down even though i was looking at two to 20 years in prison. nothing scared me more than being sick from the drugs. on september 29, 2008, i was called in for a random drug test and failed because i had shot up oxycontin the day before. at the courthouse they handcuffed me and shackled me and sent me to southwestern regional jail where i did a total of 10 days. as i sat there in that jail cell and cried, i thought a pill could not be worth two to 20 years of my life, and i hit my knees and prayed to god that if he brought me out of that jail cell, that i would never, ever, ever touch drugs again. the lord answered my prayer and the judge gave me the choice to stay in jail or go to the life center of galax, in galax, virginia. i chose to go to rehab. i completed the 30-day program and came back and did thomas memorial's intense outpatient program for 6 more weeks. once i got home i was sentenced to two to 20 years, but they suspended my sentence. i went through drug court and completed it. i was the third person to ever graduate from the lincoln county drug court. i also had to do 14 more days in jail, 6 months of home confinement, and 4 years' probation. i can honestly say that going to jail and rehab saved my life. if i hadn't have been put in jail, i would probably be 6 feet in the ground just like a lot of my friends that i had to bury. all of these things combined gave me something i hold very dear to my heart. my recovery. recovery has not only given my life back. it has given me a chance to be a daughter, a sister, a wife, and hopefully a mother someday, a productive member of society, a good friend, but most of all, my recovery has given me a chance to be the voice of the sick and suffering addicts who lay in bed at night wondering if there is a way out. i enjoy giving people hope and showing them that treatment does work. i am living proof that if you work the program of recovery, it will work for you. since that day i had found myself sitting in that jail cell with no hope and my life completely consumed by my addiction, my life has changed for the better. i have graduated with an associate's degree in applied science from southern west virginia community technical college. i went on to get my bachelor's degree in the arts of psychology from west virginia state university, and now i am currently working on my masters of social work degree at concord university, and i will graduate with that degree in may. i have also been able to go to various schools, drug courts, and different places around the state to tell my story of addiction from where i was then to where i am now. i have also had the pleasure of working with a great group of people who are trying to get a sober living home open in danville, west virginia called the hero house. i can tell you, she is so passionate about getting this hero house so she can help other people. anybody listening who wants to help chelsea in danville, wv, with the hero house, please do so or contact my office. now, with all this being said, i don't tell my story to get praise. i tell my story because there is a son, a daughter, a husband, a father, a wife, and many, many other people out there addicted to drugs and they do not see a light at the end of the tunnel. when you are in active addiction, that light is so dim and a lot of times people think they are going to die from this horrible disease. but i am here to show people that you don't have to die. you don't have to let that horrible addiction win. you can step out and take your life back, because i am here to tell you that if you don't, if you don't, your addiction is going to take you to your grave. drugs do not discriminate. they know no good, no bad, no rich, no poor. there are so many people out there who suffer from this because there is little to no treatment. by the grace of god i was sent to rehab and given a second chance. i still have the horrible reminders every day of the things i did to my family, to my body, and, most of all, to my self-esteem. i have the track marks after being 7 years sober that constantly remind me of the life i once lived. i have a poor self-image because of the men i chose to give myself to just to get a pill, and the damage i did to my family because i had no cares in the world. one day i hope there is enough treatment to help the addicts who want help. people need to be given a second chance and shown there is a better way of life than to do drugs. [[page s947]] i have another story called tami's story, but i know chelsea. i know this girl. she is impressive. she said: please tell my story, i want people to know. no one could come from a finer family than i came from. no one can go lower than i have gone, and no one but by the grace of god could be saved like i was. when we hear these stories--and all she is saying is there is no treatment. she was lucky. she found a treatment center. somehow we have to come to grips with this. we have a tax on tobacco because we know it is harmful and we have to cure people of the disease. we have a tax on alcohol. we have no fee whatsoever on opiates--none--and it is destroying lives like nothing else that has ever happened in this country. we need to make people conscious of this, and we need to have an fda that is compassionate, but not only that, is committed to the change that needs to be made in our culture. i want to read tami's story, from west virginia. that is in the northern panhandle. chelsea was way down in the southern part of our state of west virginia. we have 2 adult children suffering from substance use disorder. our son entered the military while in college. he was sent to iraq right after 9/11, december 27, 2001. he experienced things that he never talked about, celebrated his 21st birthday there, and returned home. he was not a saint when he went to war. he had a juvenile past of drinking. back then we thought he was a typical teenager acting out. when he returned, he suffered ptsd, as many do, and went to the va hospital for treatment. he was put on cocktail after cocktail of medications. we all know this. we all know that basically these brave men and women who are willing to risk their lives and sacrifice their lives for us--in order to treat their pain, we think, just give them a prescription, and they are able to get anything and everything. that is what they are talking about when he was put on cocktail after cocktail of medications--was this his starting point of the spiral into addiction? i believe his addiction to opioids, benzoids, and amphetamines started then. i know that he spiraled from that point on. he lost his marriage, he didn't see his son, he bounced from drugs to drugs to drugs. he obtained several duis, and time after time he walked away, no offer of help, no sentencing. he bounced, married again. she was addicted to heroin. he bounced again, was in and out of our house. unfortunately, we always gave him a safe place to land. she said: ``unfortunately,''--not fortunately but unfortunately--``we always gave him a safe place to land.'' the last time i saw him is when i called the police on him. i discovered that him and his girlfriend, with two small children, who had been living in our house for four months were using and selling drugs. i found out he was recently incarcerated for drug traffic and sent to a correctional rehabilitation facility. our daughter was an athlete all through school. she received injury after injury, and at 18 started seeing specialists for back pain. that was in 2004. they prescribed opiates. i never saw the addiction coming. she lost her best friend since first grade that year to a drunk driving accident. she went to counseling. more prescriptions. she appeared fine, gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, and then because of back pain more pain prescriptions were given. i realized she had a problem when she was pregnant with her second child and was stepped down to vicodin while pregnant. vicodin while pregnant. after his birth, we started her first rehab experience. she returned to the father of her children sober. she relapsed and began snorting heroin. at this time she was living in ohio and we were unaware of her relapse. we found out when her mother-in-law went to court and took her children. that was one of the worst days of all of our lives. we immediately picked her up, brought her back to west virginia, and into treatment. fast forward. thousands of dollars later on attorneys, doctors, rehab, she returns to ohio to try to obtain her children. relapsed. she began shooting heroin and then arrested. we let her sit in jail and picked her up on her release. charges were dismissed. back to west virginia she comes, hospitalized for a week and rehab again. she has now been in recovery for 13 months. she fell in love with a nice, drug-free man, moved to ohio to try to obtain custody of her children back, and is six months pregnant. one thing i can say is my daughter was always a good mother. even while on active addiction, she worked and took care of them. as you can tell, both of our children became addicted to prescription drugs first. . . and they tell me this is exactly how it starts. it starts at a very young age. recreational marijuana, prescription drugs out of your parents' medicine cabinet, taking it to school, being the cool kid in school, sharing those drugs, then you begin using them, then you sell them. this is how it starts, and it leads to obtaining street drugs to feed their addiction. so it goes from occasional to recreational to addiction to feeding that addiction. this is a condensed version of course. as with any family dealing with addiction, it does not show the tears, the hurt, the financial breakdown put on the family; (we are broke). literally and figuratively. she says: i want to thank you for listening. doctors keep prescribing pills, and they will tell you that they have had very little training in this area. as they go through all of their medical schools and advanced training, they get very little training on the effects these drugs have on human beings and the addiction. we took 1 billion pills off the market when we went from 90 days to 30 days of vicodin and lortab. we took that many pills off the market. that means 30 days. i have people in my office or in their families--and i know the presiding officer does as well--who will go to the doctor for something where they may need pain relief for 1 or 2 days. do you know what they get? they automatically get enough pills for 30 days. that is the path of least resistance. it is legal, they can do it, and the doctor will write a 30-day prescription. we are working on a bill that will be coming to the floor. we need to make a lot of changes to that bill, but most importantly, we need to make sure we have an agency in the federal government of the united states of america that is fighting to protect every american. and it is not a business plan that we have to adhere to, not at all. these are good companies. they are legal pharmaceutical companies. they do an awful lot of good. i challenge every one of them that is listening to what we are talking about right now to give us pain relief without addiction to opioids. do something. break through the chemistry or something. it has to be there. we have been able to solve every other epidemic. we have been able to cure epidemics and pandemics, and now we have one that has been ravaging our country for almost 30 years. i have samantha's story. she says: hello. my name is samantha holbrooke. she wants you to know her name. i am from fayette county, wv. i am a 28-year-old female. i have been an addict for the past 6 years. this letter is to explain to you how addiction has affected my life. it is also to express my view on drugs and what it is doing to our society. i first started drugs when i was 13 years old. i was a recreational marijuana user. my mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict. my father was not in the home or involved in my life. unfortunately, that is true for many people around this country. my mother would allow me to drink with her and go to bars. i was often her designated driver, but i was only 13 years old. i got in my first and only bar fight at 13. it was with a 24-year-old woman. she thought i was coming on to her boyfriend. in reality, we were smoking weed, not trying to hook up. when i was 19, my oldest sister and mother introduced me to hydrocodone, ritalin, xanax, and percocet. my sister and mother had no income; i did. by getting me on pills, they were able to get free pills by charging me to get them for them. by the time i was 22, i think i was snorting oxycodone. oxycodone is made in a single source, which is a powder form that is compressed. they would break it down, crush it, and snort it to get the quicker high. that became my drug of choice. i eventually got in with a doctor who was pretty much a pill mill. we know we have them all over this country. he wrote me a prescription for xanax and oxycodone. i got even more strung out on those two. as a result of using drugs, i now have memory problems, concentration problems, and the list goes on and on. i lost about 30 pounds. i lost my job. i lost my home. i lost my child. i lost my fiance to suicide. he was drunk when he shot himself in the head. i believe that had he not been drinking, he wouldn't have taken his own life. as a result of these life-changing events, i became severely depressed. i then took the wrong road and began to use drugs intravenously. i started lying and stealing. this led me to gain two felony charges and several other misdemeanors. i went to jail and prison and spent 2\1/2\ years locked up. i am now on drc because i am on parole and had a relapse, which led to several bad decisions, and now i am paying the consequences. i am now in recovery. i am a recovering addict. i joined narcotics anonymous and [[page s948]] alcoholics anonymous. the classes and programming in prison helped me to think better. i now analyze a situation before making a decision. this is my story. prescription drugs and all drugs have ruined a large percentage of the citizens of west virginia's lives. i am now in full control of my life again, thank the lord. this story is anonymous, but they wanted to share it with us. i grew up in a nice home. my grandfather was a pastor. my dad grew up in church. my family went to church every sunday. we had a nice house. we had nice cars. my mom didn't have to work, and my dad took very good care of us. my dad had surgery, a common surgery to remove several large veins in his legs. this is where his addiction began. this is where he found his unlimited supply of numbness. i was in middle school, and this is when i remember things being different. things were changing. my dad stayed out with his friends a lot. he wasn't home for dinner anymore. when he was home, he was lying down sleepy and always said silly things. i would stay up late at night until he would get home, only to hear my mom and dad fighting, screaming, and my mom crying. eventually i hated to hear the garage door open because i didn't want him to come home. before my dad would take me to school, standing in his business suit with his briefcase, he would scarf down pills out of a little orange bottle. he would tip it back like he was eating a box of nerds. i didn't know any better. my naive, my innocent mind didn't know what was happening. i couldn't comprehend that a doctor could be his drug dealer! they couldn't comprehend that because we have been taught to trust doctors. things got worse. i started finding bottles of liquor and cans of beer hidden, and i passed it off. the 3 empty beers in the back of his company car: oh, they must be his ``friends''. no one in our family drinks, definitely not my dad. i remember whole vacations, weekend trips, and afternoons ruined by his addiction. mad fits of rage until one day my mom stood up and couldn't take it anymore. my dad got the help he needed, but how did he get the help? in hiding, in private--a local rehab facility. he was on a business trip. our culture has stigmatized a group of people--a group of people who transcend race, status, gender--at the expense of their lives. this is a hidden killer. drug abuse and drug addiction are hidden killers. so many of us have people in our families or close friends who don't want to talk about it. they are ashamed, and so it gets covered up and hidden away. as a result, we don't bring people out, let them know the effects, and cure them. she says: my dad was hurting. no, not from the wounds on his legs when he had his surgery but from depression and bipolar disorder. these are the roots of his addiction. they go hand in hand. when will we see this? when will we stop seeing addicts as a problem and see them as human beings and hurting? for the last 20 to 30 years, i have been in public life, and the presiding officer has been in public life a good bit. i always thought that anybody who fools with drugs is a criminal and should be put in jail. we have done that, and it hasn't solved a thing. it has gotten a lot worse. we have to rethink this issue. this is not a crime. addiction is basically an illness. it needs to have a cure, and treatment is that cure. we have to face that. senate republicans and democrats are looking at how to fix the sentencing guidelines, and i think it is encouraging and healthy for us to have these discussions. she says: is it a selfish sickness? of course it is. but how can we help them see the light when we push them aside? because ``they asked for it?'' just like a lady with skin cancer ``asked for it'' because she laid in a tanning bed? what if we treated addicts with the same compassion that we treat cancer patients? my father has been clean for almost a decade, and the demons of his addiction still haunt us all. no, we weren't homeless, nor did we have to face a death to be completely broken by this horrible epidemic, but i had a zombie for a father for my adolescence. i missed my childhood, years that we can never get back, memories that will never be erased, all because of a little orange pill bottle chased and hidden with a brown paper bag. luckily, my story ends with a happy ending. i still have my dad. my story hasn't ended up the way so many do every day, like my two friends who didn't get help in time and passed away. i have stories from all over the country, and they are pathetic. i have a couple more i can read from west virginia. i will go to different states. this is erica's story. she says: hello, my name is erica and i am an addict. and i say that with great pride as i celebrated 10 years of recovery in november of 2015. i began using drugs here in west virginia at the ripe age of 13. thirteen seems to be that magic--adolescence. we are coming into adolescence. we are willing to experiment. we think we are invincible. we think nothing can harm us. prescription drugs were easily accessible at that age and opened the door to 11 years of anguish, desperation, jails, and dirty needles. i came from a stable, drug- and alcohol- free home, but i was able to gain access to prescription drugs from my peers and my local middle school and high school on a daily basis. as my disease progressed, i dropped out of high school my freshman year and continued to put myself and family through years of pain and suffering. i attempted drug replacement therapy to control my opioid addiction, but that was only a temporary solution, and i eventually returned to drugs. finally, i found myself in the court system and facing felony drug charges. it was then that i was able to find freedom through a 12-step fellowship. today i can say i am a cum laude graduate of marshall university, fully employed, homeowner, wife, and the mother of two wonderful west virginia boys. i pray my children don't follow the path that, not only myself, but many of my west virginians fall into. the disease of addiction is progressive and fatal if not treated or prevented. here in west virginia, we are leading the nation in drug overdoses. and where i live in cabell county, we have had over 900 overdoses in just the year of 2015. as a mother, i must trust our leaders to make responsible choices to help us seek solutions, gain back our communities, and save our children from following the same deadly path. i know the fda was so proud that they came out with some new guidelines, and they said now they are going to start paying attention to the advisory committees. they didn't say they would adhere to their recommendations; they would just start paying attention to them. also, the cdc--the centers for disease control--put out some guidelines of how we should be prescribing, the knowledge we should have, how we should be administering, and what we should be doing to curb this drug abuse. and guess which agency fought against that and put it on delay? the fda. the only thing i ask all of my colleagues to do is to please consider--just send a message with the vote you make tomorrow. it is not about the doctor at all. it is not about the person before us. it is about getting an advocate who will make a real change and make sure we fight this war. this story is another anonymous story: my brother is in his early 20s and was hired at the local plant that employs the majority of the county. he was injured on the job, saw his doctor, and was prescribed lortab long term. lortab, as i said before, is a schedule iii, 90 days. you can keep calling it in, calling it in, and calling it in. as the effects from this started to wane, he was prescribed xanax, klonopin, and a variety of other prescription medicines. he then lost his good-paying job but found other work at a lower pay after almost a year of unemployment. this prescription med addiction continued for years, and once laws finally cracked down on prescribing narcotics, it left him unable to get all the medicines he had previously been prescribed. once it became too expensive to buy them on the street, he turned to heroin. my fun-loving brother who was always at family functions, loved to be around his nieces and nephews, totally disappeared. i suspected that something more serious was going on, but he wouldn't answer calls or texts. in august, i hadn't seen him in several months. we have always been close. this was very unusual. i sent him a novel of a text since he wouldn't take my phone calls confronting him over the rumors that i had heard of his heroin use. he denied it. a few short weeks later, i got a call from my mother that he was transported to the hospital by ambulance but discharged a few hours later for chest pain. he later told us he had gotten a bad batch of heroin and was certain he was dying. he told the ems he had used that morning, as well as hospital staff. i still to this day don't understand how someone can come in suffering from an overdose and be discharged a few hours later. people don't have knowledge. they are not being trained in this horrible epidemic that we have in this country. nothing was mentioned to him about treatment or rehab and he was treated as a [[page s949]] lesser person. i was worried before, but after this was in a constant state of fear that i would get a call that my 31- year-old brother was dead. in october, he called me to tell me yes he was a heroin addict, but a new treatment center had opened near his home and he wanted to get clean. he asked if i would go with him, and i said of course yes. his insurance wouldn't cover a dime of this treatment. it would be all out of his pocket at $100 a day plus the cost of meds. for someone working at a $30,000 or less a year job, paying for housing, utilities, food, (he never did receive public assistance)-- he was too proud for that-- this cost was more than he could do. again i told him i would be there and pay for whatever he couldn't. i convinced him he needed more of a support system than just me and he finally told our parents. we were we were raised in church and came from a large religious family. he was so ashamed of what he had become he didn't want the family to know and the majority of them still don't know to this day. i am hoping, as this letter was written anonymously, eventually he will share this with the family, maybe preventing other members from going down this road. he will tell them when he is ready. my mom and i went with him to his first appointment at the suboxyne clinic, and one of us has been at every appointment since. it is wonderful-- he has a session with a psychiatrist at every visit. it's more than prescribing meds. they are doing the counseling to make sure their patients get clean. i am proud to say that after only four months, not only is he clean but he has weaned off the suboxyne. he still goes for counseling and has the nurse's cell that he can call 24 hours a day if he's having a hard day. in the future he wants to tell his story and help others facing the same crisis. madam president, i have been reading stories of people addicted all over the state of west virginia. i have stories from your state also, madam president. i would like to read that for you. this is in new hampshire--sandown, nh. this is kathleen's story. i am sure she has sent you the same copy she sent me. she wants her name to be known. my name is kathleen stephens. i am a 56 year old rn, bsn, from sandown, nh. i am currently the director of clinical service at a nationwide hospice company. my story is much like thousands of others out there, pretty average, fairly normal. i have two children; a 33-year-old son who graduated with a degree in mathematics from boston university and a 31- year-old daughter who graduated with a psychology degree from assumption college. i myself have a bachelor of science and nursing degree and my children's father a bachelor's degree in business from wharton school of business in pa. i give you this detailed background for to you see that we are a well educated and successful family. we are a white, mid to upper middle class who have always lived in a beautiful neighborhood surrounded by loving families whose children played outside, joined peewee soccer, little league, softball, basketball and girl scouts to name but a few. we were the home in the neighborhood where all the children loved to play. we took our children to drive in movies, camping, the beach, museums and always visited their grandparents. we were normal, that's all, or what we perceived was normal. when speaking with our children now, they both recount wonderful childhoods and deem themselves ``lucky.'' our house was filled with love. i hugged my kids all the time, never hesitated to demonstrate to or tell them how much i loved them. they had grandparents who were always around, who also demonstrated love for them. about 5 years ago, my daughter, and her boyfriend, an intern at tufts medical school decided, after being together for 2 years that they would move to sacramento. i was devastated inside but encouraged my daughter to follow her heart. over the subsequent years, our communications went from daily to weekly to scattered. each conversation seemed more distant than the last. we saw her an average of twice a year; most significantly, when we paid her expenses to come home for christmas. her boyfriend never came; he distanced himself from us almost immediately. i'm sure at this point you know the story. about 18 months ago i finally confronted my daughter asking what was wrong, seeing her go from a loving daughter to a distant person i no longer knew. over the previous few years, she turned into a virtual stranger. i told her i loved her no matter what and that i would be there for her. at that time she denied any issue. a few weeks later she was in the hospital and called me. apparently, she had hit bottom. she confided that she was a heroin addict. i was more than shocked. she had been in a substance free dorm in college, hated drinking, drugs and was pretty straight laced overall. i kept myself in check saying that no matter what i would support her, asked her to come home so we could help her. she confided that it started with a prescription for opioids that her boyfriend had shared with her. he was given one for back pain years before, got hooked and decided she might just like it. so, amazingly she did come home, but she went back a few months later. she then returned to get clean again and went back a few months later. she overdosed multiple times, of which i knew nothing until recently. her boyfriend gave her iv heroin while she was in the hospital being treated for pneumonia to keep her habit going. he was the one, i found out later, that he shot her up because she hated doing it. he had developed a hold on her that was a bond of heroin high. i knew the drug had gotten her when, due to the stress of everything happening, i ended up in the hospital ruling out a heart attack. she drove me there, dropped me off and went to get high (i found out later). i ended up being fine, stress of course, and she ended up going back home yet again. she stayed clean after going into a rehab, which kicked her out after 8 days because her insurance was declined. she then attended na-- narcotics anonymous-- meetings almost daily and got a job that she loved. in the meantime, her boyfriend was found out through a ``random'' drug test and suspended. she was clean for 4 months, the happiest four months of my life. we spoke every few days, or texted. her voice was truly hers again . . . her laughter, her expressions, her humor. i felt she was finally back with us. she had left her boyfriend and went into a sober living home. life was good and i was so grateful to have my daughter, my best friend, back. about 3 months into her sobriety she decided to reach out and try to get her boyfriend sober as well, the beginning of the end. at exactly month 4 she went to his house and he had a ``surprise'' for her. she was new in her sobriety, just once she said, and she fell back down the rabbit hole. i knew when she didn't return my calls or texts that it was bad. but finally she responded; she was back into it again, but she'd get out she promised. the next 8 months were a few weeks clean then back into drugs again. i did not send her money. honestly, she never asked. she knew i'd never support her habit. around thanksgiving 2015 she had had it. she called me and said she wanted to get back into rehab and leave her boyfriend permanently. her life was no longer worth living. weeks of trying to get her into rehab went unsuccessfully when we finally found clean and sober in sacramento. at that point she was clean two weeks, had slowly packed up or sold her belongings and was ready for the break. but she had to sneak out to get away from her very controlling, manipulative partner; and she did. the happy part: she is today 60 days sober. she has a new job (she had been fired from the other one), which she loves. she blocked her boyfriend from her phone, her email and her facebook. she is the daughter, once again, that i know and love, but i love her regardless of the disease of addiction. love the addict, hate the disease. and for right now i thank god, pray alot, and take it one day at a time. i have another one here i want to share with you. the thing i wanted to share, madam president, is this: my state and your state have probably been hit as hard as any two states in the country. we have people coming to us all the time. we are fighting every way we can. we are introducing pieces of legislation. we are not worrying about who is republican or democrat. how can we help americans--the beautiful people in new hampshire, the wonderful people in west virginia, who are facing more deaths, more disease, more destruction to the family? i want to share with you that when i first got elected--senator byrd had died in 2010. i was governor of the state of west virginia. i had to make a decision. i thought maybe i could come to washington and help with the experiences i had and what i had seen in my state and times. we had challenges. after i was elected to the senate, i had gone back to oceana, wv. at that time it had been called ``oxyana'' because drug use was so rampant in this beautiful town. i remembered this town because when i was a freshman in college, my roommate was from this town. it was the most beautiful town i had been in. they had everything. what a privilege it would have been to grow up in this beautiful town, but i could see many years later it was not the town i knew or remembered in my mind. i went to the middle school. these were all children in fifth to eighth grade. i tried to give pep talks. i wanted to get them involved and tell them how good they could be, how much we are counting on them, what they need to get a good education and contribute something back to society, and how fortunate and lucky they are to be in this little town. after i finished speaking--they were attentive and cooperative--there was a group of them. they asked: can we talk to you privately? i will never forget this. these were 12- and 13-year-old [[page s950]] boys and girls. there had to be six or seven of them. i went in the back room and sat at a table. they started talking and telling me their stories. these were stories they had watched and were telling me. this was the first time i had ever heard from a child up close and personal who said: my dad worked at the mines. he had a back problem. he got hurt. they kept giving him pills. we lost our house. mom and dad were fighting. they got divorced. we lost everything. i've got nothing now. my grandparents were watching me while i was trying to take care of us. my dad is an addict. i heard these stories from these five kids. they were all pleading. now fast forward to the year 2015. i go back to the same school. these kids that were 12 years old are now seniors in high school. the same group wants to talk to me. they had lived a clean life, but i think about what they have gone through and what they have seen. then i sit down with another group of 12- and 13-year-olds from the same area. they are telling me stories about how they are watching their lives before them when they watch a boyfriend or a stepfather because the family had broken apart, the mother remarried or whatever, and the person that she is with is a drug addict. this little child watches her mother get shot up and killed because of the drugs the boyfriend shoots into the mother. can you imagine a 12- or 13-year-old having to live with this and see this happen in their home? what we are asking is simply for the food and drug administration to change, to be the watchdog to help us. they are supposed to protect us. they don't say: i did my job. the pharmaceutical company told me they made this drug, and this is the way it was made. this is what it was supposed to do. we checked it out. everything is fine; leave it on the market. you are not looking at the welfare of the people. you know what it does. you know it is addictive. we have no treatment centers. we are doing nothing to treat this. we are not challenging these pharmaceutical companies who are good companies. they do a lot of good and put a lot of products out there that are very good, but they are bringing these opiates on the market quicker than ever before, more powerful than ever before, and they know what is going to happen. i am challenging all of them. i think the fda should challenge them. we are not going to approve more opiates. we are not going to let you bring on the market stronger opiates that we know are addictive and will ruin people's lives. if they will do that and challenge these companies to come out with new research and development that can scientifically give us relief needed for people who have chronic pain without making them addicts who lose their lives--we should be able to do that in this great country. i am going to read you a story from kentucky, my next door neighbor, the majority leader's home--kentucky and west virginia. this is emily from louisville, ky. my name is emily walden. i am a mother who lost my 21-year- old son to a drug overdose in 2012. my son tj came from a good family, was a member of the kentucky national guard and the most respectful young man you could have ever met. tj made an initial poor decision that led to an addiction to the drug opana; he had unlimited access to this drug during that time. tj did not want to die from this. he tried very hard to overcome his addiction and i tried very hard to save his life. i started researching the drug opana about five years ago and would like to share with you what i have learned that illustrates the need for changes to our fda policies and approval processes for all opioid drugs. the drug opana contains the opioid oxymorphone which was removed from the market in 1979 due to the overdose deaths and addiction this drug was causing across our country. in 2002, the fda started holding immpact meetings every year allowing pharmaceutical companies to pay money to be included in discussions and changes to clinical trials, design. we call that pay to play--the impact it has because they are able to go to these types of settings and get absolute front row seats with the people they are trying to persuade to take another look at these drugs that might have been taken off the market because they were deemed too dangerous. this is allowed to go on. it has been going on for far too long, and the fda is part of it. this is part of the change that needs to be made and made immediately. endo pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of opana, attended each one of these ``pay-to-play'' meetings. in 2003, endo pharmaceuticals brought the drug opana to the fda for approval and was denied due to the overdoses that occurred during the clinical trials. in 2006, endo pharmaceuticals again brought the drug opana to the fda for approval but this time using new clinical trial that applied a modified process, called ``enriched enrollment,'' which removed patients with preexisting opiate sensitivities from the trial. the enriched enrollment process skews results and seriously underestimates risks associated with the proposed drug involved in the clinical trial. in addition, the fda ignored their own review guidance by bypassing their advisory committee and approved opana for moderate to severe pain. at the time opana was approved, our country was already experiencing an explosion of overdose deaths and addiction from the overprescribing and misrepresentation of the safety of opiates. in addition to causing thousands of deaths and addiction, the approved use of opana has now been directly implicated in an outbreak of hepatitis c and hiv cases in the state of indiana. the fda has continued to use enriched enrollment-- or pay to play-- to approve new opiates and override or bypass altogether their advisory committee for new opiate approvals and for new uses of opiates further contributing to the overdose deaths and addiction. these process changes must stop. the year after my son died i traveled to washington dc for the first time in my life and was very fortunate to be able to meet with the then senate minority leader-- now senate majority leader-- senator mcconnell, the next year i had nine meetings which included a meeting with then acting director botticelli of ondcp, dea administrator michelle leonhart and seven meetings with senator's staff. in 2015 i had thirteen meetings scheduled. i am not going away! we need change to curb this horrible epidemic that started with prescribed opiates and the mistakes that were made need to be corrected. how many people have to die? how many more people have to become addicted? the fda is sending the wrong message to physicians by continuing to approve opioids during the worst drug epidemic our country has ever faced. the presiding officer (ms. ayotte). the senator's postcloture time has expired. mr. manchin. i ask unanimous consent to continue. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. manchin. thank you, madam president. the fda is supposed to be protecting public health and yet over 200,000 people have died and they have failed to put appropriate restrictions on these dangerous drugs to prevent overdose deaths. i want to know why there is one death from something such as ecoli and every head of lettuce is pulled from the shelves in ten different states but opioids have killed thousands of people and they are considered safe and effective? how can that be? when is the fda going to put human life before the paychecks of big pharma? what will it take? a million deaths? we need an fda commissioner that will protect the citizens of this country that is willing to take the overall best interest of public safety into consideration and not allow the pharmaceutical companies to have him in their back pockets. my son tj had a lifelong dream of joining the military and fighting for his country. he would have given his life to protect and serve. he was one of the most patriotic young men and his country failed him. please do the right thing. please do not let one more mother get a knock on her door saying their child is gone and that they will never [ever] come home [again]. there is no greater pain than burying your child! my son, my precious child with the most beautiful blue eyes, caring and loving heart, died in part by the greed of big pharma and-- most importantly-- the carelessness of the fda. it is time for change! another story from kentucky. this is in northern kentucky and this is kimberly's story. my name is kimberly wright. i am a [mother from northern kentucky] who works in the trenches to save the lives of people in my community. nky was hit by a pill epidemic around 2000. that pill epidemic has now turned into a heroin epidemic. since 2013 the death toll continues to climb. in 2015 we have had 1,168 overdose reverses. we still await the number of deaths. our entire system is on the verge of collapse--our courts, police, children's services, jails. our jails currently have 99% heroin and pill cases housed in the jails. our treatment system is seriously strained with not 1 new bed added in the last 10 years since this epidemic started. we are in a war in [northern kentucky]. every day we wait to see how many died that day. we have people getting in their cars driving high on pills and heroin wrecking into innocent people and killing them. this is the united states of america and this is a shame. we allow the fda and big pharma to profit off the deaths of an entire generation of young people. we are in effect losing 2 jumbo jets full of kids every day [[page s951]] in america due to pills and heroin. we need help. we are begging for help to stop this madness. our american families are losing our children at an alarming rate to overprescribing drs and big pharma. we beg you, please help us stop this. i lost my sister alicia cook on october 26, 2010, to an overdose. alicia was a nurse with 2 young daughters. this epidemic has no boundaries and it's in every community in the country. northern kentucky has the highest rates of hepc, surpassing the national level, due to heroin and pills being injected. we have a high rate of homeless children due to their parents being dead or drug addicted with no end in sight. we have 52% of grandparents raising their grandchildren due to death and addiction. this is a nightmare for parents. when our children were born we could have never imagined this would be our life. you don't sleep at night from the anxiety of wondering if you are the next parent to get that call that your child has overdosed. it's like being in a constant panic attack. it's not normal to grieve the loss of a child who is alive, for they are truly lost. i [know lots of] parents who have lost their child and i can't imagine their pain and grief. i grieve for my addicted 26- year-old daughter who is in the fight of her life [because of] her addiction. i watch her destroying herself every day. i don't want to join the mothers who have lost their child to this epidemic. i know how i suffer now and i just can't go there. i will continue to fight for my community. will you [please] join me? that is arlene's story. indiana is one of the states that has been hit so hard also. this is danielle's story from southern indiana. my name is danielle mccowan. i live in southern indiana and work as a server. about 2 and a half years ago a customer by the name of josh harvey left me his number. at the time he told me he was living in chicago for school. little did i know he was in rehab there. granted, i didn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in constant contact. over a year or so ago i found out about his heroin addiction. he still told me little about it. i do know it started out with prescription pills and later went to heroin when the pills became harder to get. he served a month in jail in michigan for the entire month of this past july over a heroin related charge. he came home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. luckily, his dad saved him that time. now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient program doing better. or so we all thought. school let out for break and i guess it all went downhill. he came to me on november the 4th telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. i suggested an in-patient program. he went to wellstone after he left my house. he sat for several hours and finally was given a room. i went and checked on him 2 different times while he waited to make sure he was there. thursday i didn't receive any calls. friday nothing either. then saturday morning, the 7th of november, his mother called me to break my heart. he had passed away that friday, the 6th, over in louisville and didn't know who to contact until that saturday morning, i guess. he had checked himself out of wellstone, broke into his house, took his xbox which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. never in a million years did i think i'd become close to anybody addicted to heroin. it doesn't discriminate. it can get ahold of any and everybody. never in my life have i been so depressed or heartbroken. all i want is his story shared. he was my happy ending gone away too soon. they continue. they continue on, these stories, the heartaches and the lives destroyed, lives changed. few too many lives are saved. massachusetts. as the presiding officer knows, senator markey has been working with me very closely and all of us on this horrible epidemic that we have. this is sara's story. she is from amherst, ma. my nuclear family is middle class or the working poor, but it is blended in that i was raised by my mother and step-dad, but my bio father's side of the family would be considered well-off. heroin first came to my radar after my brother donny became addicted to pain pills after surgery, and heroin followed suit after rx's stopped. then it seemed like it was everywhere around me: my nephew, my niece. then we lost my cousin cory, who passed in a sober house for his addiction to alcohol, along with a needle and an empty bag next to him. cory is an example of a young man institutionalized by multiple incarcerations and just when he would try to lift himself up, in he would go again. he was trying to get clean for his girlfriend and unborn child when he passed away, and he was happy, thinking he was getting better. living with someone close who struggles and then multiply that by two, and adolescence, young adulthood mixed in, and you have my descent as an empathetic aunt who felt powerless to change anything. then the bottom dropped out. my cousin, john ahern, passed at the end of august after a long period of recovery alone in the woods. it didn't matter he came from privilege or was the nicest person i had every known in my life for so long. he leaves behind three loving sons. they both couldn't access the help they needed at various stages, including recovery, and died alone. it is my mission to stand up for them and the young people like my niece who began her struggle at 14, and now approaching 18 has some clean time. there are no support programs in my community for this age group, and especially for non-white young people like my niece and nephew. they are both of latino descent. please do something. people are begging us everywhere in this country to help them, and basically it starts with treating this as an illness and not as a crime. it starts also with having clinics, having basic places where we can serve them and help them get clean. they cannot do it by themselves, and they are the first to tell you. the stories i am reading here exemplify that so well. i have a florida story here, and florida has also been ravaged. florida was a problem that we had in west virginia because of the pill mills there. people would take the bus down or they could take a cheap flight down to florida, buy all the pills they could and come back. florida has been very helpful in the last years trying to stop the pill epidemic. this is janet from fort lauderdale. dear senator manchin. i appreciate you taking the time to stop the appointment of dr. califf from becoming the fda commissioner. i founded stoppnow--stop the organized pill pushers now--due to all the drug-addicted babies i was caring for as a neonatal intensive care nurse at a children's hospital in broward county, fl. we started holding protests in front of the 150 pill mills that were in broward county alone. many parents came out to protest with us. parents from all over the country contacted us as well. too many parents are crying themselves to sleep over the loss of their child. at first, there were no consequences for either the clinic owner or the doctor. then they started arresting the doctors for money laundering. our state's attorney has called the doctors drug dealers in white coats. the board of medicine is not protecting the public by allowing high-prescribing doctors to keep their license. therefore, the plight of the drug-addicted babies and the devastation to the families continues to rise. when one clinic owner was arrested, he was earning $150,000 a day. i repeat, $150,000 a day. not one doctor in that clinic to date has lost his license or his practice. we only have the judicial system helping to alleviate this in florida. doctors are now being charged with first-degree murder. it would be kinder for a doctor to lose his license than to sit in a courtroom at their own murder trial. we have been unsuccessful in our efforts for lawmakers to mandate that prescribers use the prescription drug monitoring program in florida. yet in this environment, there is a bill passing through the committees allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe narcotics without a doctor signing off on the order. i would support this bill if they included the mandate. and, of course, the fda approved that children as young as 11 years old can be prescribed oxycontin. we definitely need an investigation. madam president, as you can see, these are problems that we have all over the country. this is not just your state and not just my state. i know it is hard. they say we need someone in there, so let's just go ahead and confirm dr. califf. dr. califf is an honorable man. he is still there. he is going to be there. he has been there for 1 year. in the 1 year that he has been there, we have basically put more opiate drugs on the market without even going through a clinical overview. if that change were going to come, it would have come by now. i am sure he could have had input, and i would hope that he would. dr. califf has called a lot of our colleagues and said that these changes will be coming. this senator will tell you the changes they recommended when they said they were going to make changes. they said: we are going to make sure that we are going to start listening to our staff and people who are reviewing these drugs. they are going to listen to them, but there is no mandate that they will have to follow. this senator has a piece of legislation that the presiding officer coauthored, and i appreciate that very much. basically what we are saying is this: when you have your advisory committee--and every drug must go through an advisory committee's opinion, and if they recommend as they did with zohydro to not let it go on the market, that cannot be bypassed, neglected, or pushed aside. our bill would basically state that they must bring it to the people's representatives in congress and state why it is so very important for them to bring this new high- powered drug to the market--as if we don't have enough. the united states has 5 percent of the world's population but consumes 80 [[page s952]] percent of these addictive opiate drugs. something is wrong. something must change. i thank the presiding officer for allowing me to be able to read the letters of people who have been affected by this all over this great country in all of our states. i know we feel the pain, and we are going to try to make these changes and make sure this agency will do what it is supposed to do. i yield the floor. mrs. murray. madam president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered.",77187
CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS952-2,CREC-2016-02-23,114,Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy (Executive Calendar),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Madam President, people across the country are now looking at what is happening here in Congress, and they are frustrated. They look at the many challenges we face as a Nation, and they want Democrats and Republicans to work together to tackle them to make sure our government is functioning and that it is working for all of our families, not just the wealthy and few. Madam President, I share that frustration. We have been able to get things done when Democrats and Republicans work together to break through the gridlock. That shouldn't end just because it is an election year. It certainly should not end when it comes to one of our most important roles here in the Senate, working with the President to evaluate and confirm judges for the highest court in our land. The Supreme Court plays such an important role in protecting the rights, liberties, and responsibilities of all Americans. Over the years the Court has made decisions that have moved our country in the right direction, and it has made decisions that have set us back. When the Court can do its work, it offers certainty to people across the country when it comes to their rights as workers or as patients or as consumers or as women or as citizens. At its best, it helps our judicial system rise above politics, above partisanship, and above the spats and sniping of the moment. In order to do that, the Court must have a full bench. It cannot have vacancies leading to potential deadlocks at every turn. That is why I was so disappointed that hours after Justice Scalia passed away, Republican leaders jumped out of the gate to say they would not allow the vacancy to be filled while President Obama was still in office. Right away--before the Nation had a chance to take in and mourn the loss of a Supreme Court Justice, a man who seriously believed in the Constitution--Republican leaders injected politics and partisanship into a process that should be about our obligations as Americans. The Constitution is very clear. Let me take a moment to read from it directly. In article II, which clearly defines the powers of the President, section 2 states that ``he shall nominate and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court and all other Officers of the United States.'' Madam President, this could not be more explicit. The President ``shall nominate'' and shall appoint with ``the Advice and Consent of the Senate''--not shall nominate in the first 3 years, not shall nominate unless the Senate leadership wants to keep the seat open for a while. The President ``shall nominate.'' That is his responsibility. Then it is our responsibility in the Senate to consider, advise, and ultimately help make sure that the vacancy is filled with a qualified person. Of course, the Senate has the right to weigh in with our advice and consent. It is our job to vet nominees sent to us by the President, to make sure they are qualified for the job, and to determine if they meet the basic standards of honesty, ethics, qualifications, and fairness. Personally, this Senator will want to evaluate if they will be independent, evenhanded in deciding cases, and if they will uphold our rights and liberties, including the critical right to privacy. Republican leaders are not objecting to a person; they are objecting to this President being allowed to do his job. That is not advice and consent; it is politicize and obstruct. Republicans say there is a precedent to stall on Supreme Court nominations in the last year of a President's term. That is not true. President Reagan had Justice Kennedy confirmed with a unanimous vote in a Democratic Senate in his last year in office. Since 1975, the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote is about 70 days. So this kind of obstruction and partisanship is absolutely wrong. People across the country will not stand for it, and I hope our Republican leaders will back down and do the right thing because evaluating and confirming Supreme Court Justices is one of the most important roles we have in the U.S. Senate. In fact, it is this issue that actually pushed me to run for the Senate in the first place. Back in 1991 I was a State senator, a former school board member, a mom. Like so many people at that time, I watched the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. For days I watched in frustration. I couldn't believe this nominee wasn't pushed on the issues that I and so many others thought were so important to our country. I didn't feel the Members on that committee represented the full spectrum of perspectives, and I decided then and there to run for the U.S. Senate to give Washington State families a voice. Now, as a U.S. Senator, I want my questions answered. I want to make sure my constituents have a seat at the table and I get to push nominees for the highest Court in the land on the issues I care about most, but I can't do that if Republicans play election-year politics and don't even allow us to have that debate. The American people will not have a voice, the Court will be dysfunctional for a year longer, and Republicans will have politicized a process that should be above this sort of petty partisanship. Many Republicans may not want to hear this, but Barack Obama is still President Obama for almost a full year more. This Senator is hopeful that Republicans will step back from this very dangerous and very partisan path they are on and work with us to consider and confirm a nominee in a reasonable timeframe. Families across the country deserve to have a functioning Supreme Court and a Congress that works well enough to allow this to happen. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

they are objecting to this president being allowed to do his job. that is not advice and consent; it is politicize and obstruct. republicans say there is a precedent to stall on supreme court nominations in the last year of a president's term. that is not true. president reagan had justice kennedy confirmed with a unanimous vote in a democratic senate in his last year in office. since 1975, the average number of days from nomination to final senate vote is about 70 days. so this kind of obstruction and partisanship is absolutely wrong. people across the country will not stand for it, and i hope our republican leaders will back down and do the right thing because evaluating and confirming supreme court justices is one of the most important roles we have in the u.s. senate. in fact, it is this issue that actually pushed me to run for the senate in the first place. back in 1991 i was a state senator, a former school board member, a mom. like so many people at that time, i watched the clarence thomas confirmation hearings. for days i watched in frustration. i couldn't believe this nominee wasn't pushed on the issues that i and so many others thought were so important to our country. i didn't feel the members on that committee represented the full spectrum of perspectives, and i decided then and there to run for the u.s. senate to give washington state families a voice. now, as a u.s. senator, i want my questions answered. i want to make sure my constituents have a seat at the table and i get to push nominees for the highest court in the land on the issues i care about most, but i can't do that if republicans play election-year politics and don't even allow us to have that debate. the american people will not have a voice, the court will be dysfunctional for a year longer, and republicans will have politicized a process that should be above this sort of petty partisanship. many republicans may not want to hear this, but barack obama is still president obama for almost a full year more. this senator is hopeful that republicans will step back from this very dangerous and very partisan path they are on and work with us to consider and confirm a nominee in a reasonable timeframe. families across the country deserve to have a functioning supreme court and a congress that works well enough to allow this to happen. thank you, madam president. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. gardner). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered.",6435

Mr. President, I am here now for the 128th time to urge that we wake up to the ugly changes that carbon pollution is wreaking on our climate. It is happening all around us, and it is happening right now, not in some far-off future. As humans we are terrestrial beings. We live on the land. So naturally we pay more attention to the experience where we live--things such as increasing average temperatures on the land and changes in extreme weather when it hits the land. We don't so much pay attention to what is happening in our warming and acidifying oceans. The oceans are a big deal in climate change. For decades the oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions. Of all the different places the excess heat goes, 93 percent is into the oceans. What we see in the atmosphere--the temperature changes we have already measured, the [[Page S953]] changes we are seeing in our habitat and what is happening to the western forest--all of that is less than the remaining 7 percent. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that the oceans have absorbed as much energy just since 1997 as they had in the preceding 130 years--as much in 20 years, less than 20 years, as they had in the preceding 130 years. According to an Associated Press write-up of the study's findings, ``Since 1997, Earth's oceans have absorbed man-made heat energy equivalent to a Hiroshima-style bomb being exploded every second for 75 straight years.'' That is the energy load of heat that has gone into our oceans--a Hiroshima-style bomb exploded every second for 75 straight years. What does all that excess energy mean for the oceans? It means that sea levels are rising, in part due to melting glaciers but also because of expanding ocean water. It is basic physics, explained by the principle of thermal expansion. When the ocean warms, it expands. It can't go down, so it comes up along our shores. We have measured sea level rise in Rhode Island since 1930. Since then, the water level is up nearly 10 inches at the tide gauge at Naval Station Newport, and rates of sea level rise are on the increase worldwide. Since 1993, global sea level has risen at a rate approximately double the average rate observed through the 20th century. It is accelerating. Current forecasts confirm that if we do nothing to curb greenhouse gas emissions over the next decades, the oceans could rise as much as 3 or 4 feet by 2100. Our State coastal management agency predicts that we could see as much as 7 feet of sea level rise in the Ocean State, in Rhode Island, by the end of the century. I hope my colleagues understand that when I come to do this, I am deadly serious about things that are predicted to happen in my State. This week, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that global sea levels are rising at their fastest rate in nearly 3,000 years. That study also estimates that about half of the 20th century sea level rise would not have occurred without global warming. The lead author, Dr. Robert Kopp, an earth scientist at Rutgers University, explained in the New York Times: Physics tells us that sea-level change and temperature change should go hand-in-hand. This new geological record confirms it. Sea level rise matters to my constituents and to all coastal communities. A related study, led by Dr. Robert Strauss, found that approximately three-quarters of the tidal flood days now occurring in towns along the east coast are a result of the rise in sea level caused by human emissions. For example, looking at tide gauge data, 32 flood days were recorded in the decade from 1955 to 1964 at Annapolis, MD, and 34 flood days were recorded in that same period for Charleston, SC. In one decade, there were 32 flood days in Annapolis and 34 flood days in Charleston. Scroll forward to the decade 2005 to 2014, and the number of flood days in Annapolis jumps to 394 from 32--in one decade-- and 219 flood days were recorded in Charleston. Sea level rise brings coastal erosion, and it brings saltwater inundation of coastal marshes and habitats. It amplifies the effects of storm surge and flooding as storms ride ashore on higher seas. It changes flood zones and affects flood insurance for homeowners. These are real problems, and they are serious problems. Dr. Strauss explains in a New York Times article this week: It's not the tide. It's not the wind. It's us. The main culprit is carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere, which again in 2015 reached new record levels. To put a little context on this, for as long as human beings have inhabited planet Earth, we have existed safely in a range between 170 and 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, we broke beyond 300 parts per million early last century, and we haven't looked back. We have now exceeded 400 parts per million. Among its harms, this excess carbon dioxide has a particularly damaging chemical effect on our oceans. Oceans, in addition to absorbing 90 percent of the heat, I pointed out, are absorbing about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide--it goes right into the oceans--roughly 600 gigatons since preindustrial times. As all that carbon is absorbed into the oceans, it changes the oceans' chemistry. It makes the oceans more acidic. The chemical reaction is simple, but the effects on the ocean are serious. This chart shows ocean pH--or acidity--over the past 25 million years, and we can see some variation across those millions of years. This is what is projected for the next 100 years: pH drops equals acidity rises. According to a research article published in the journal Nature Geoscience, the rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at any time recorded in the past 50 million years. Scientists go back and they can see this in the geologic record. We have broken every record for 50 million years--millions of years before human beings were ever on the planet. This all may sound esoteric, but it has real hometown consequences for Rhode Island, where coastal life defines our heritage, our culture, and our economy. Fishing is big business in my State. Rhode Island's annual farmed oyster production, for instance, is valued at over $5 million. But carbon pollution is changing the very chemistry in which those oysters must survive. Research on the effects of ocean acidification on shellfish and other marine life can barely keep up with a rapidly acidifying ocean--another reason we need more money for research. Change is coming at us faster. We have to speed up the pace of research to understand it. But what we do know is that shellfish, such as mussels, clams, and oysters, make their shells from calcium carbonate, and calcium carbonate dissolves in acidified seawater. Here is how Bob Rheault, executive director of the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association, put it: The only thing we know for sure is that the larvae, in that first 48-hour period before they start feeding, are tremendously susceptible to dissolution. Their energy budget goes negative because they haven't started to feed yet, and if they haven't got enough energy in that egg and they're starting to dissolve, then it takes extra energy to lay down shell, and they sometimes don't make it. Here we see normal, healthy oyster larvae in those first few crucial days of development, compared to larvae growing in more acidic ocean water. NOAA scientists have projected that the world's oceans and coastal estuaries will become 150 percent more acidic by 2100. This could mean disaster for shellfish--a $1 billion industry around the country. U.S. shellfish production is currently expected to see a 10- to 25-percent reduction in the next five decades, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Again, pardon me for being serious about this, but it is currently predicted that a major industry in my State is going to be knocked down 10 to 25 percent because we are making our oceans acidic with carbon pollution. A study published last year found that Rhode Island's shellfish populations are especially vulnerable. Mark Gibson is the deputy chief of marine fisheries at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, and he calls ocean acidification a ``significant threat'' to local fisheries. I don't know how many Senators are expected to forget or ignore a significant threat to an industry in their home State because it is inconvenient for lobbyists and for the fossil fuel industry, but I don't think that is a fair thing to ask of me. But acidification is not the only problem for fishermen. In a 2015 survey from the Center for American Progress, 40 percent of fishermen in the Northeast reported catching new fish species they don't usually see in the waters they fish. Rhode Islanders are starting to catch tarpon and grouper, usually tropical fish; our valuable winter flounder fishery is virtually gone; and our lobstermen have to go farther and farther out to sea to find cooler waters where they can catch their lobsters. Among the fishermen surveyed, 80 percent of those who noticed ``warmer water temperatures'' attribute it to climate change. This is new. When I first got to the Senate, if I went down to Galilee--Rhode Island's largest fishing port--and tried to talk to the fishermen there about climate change or ocean acidification, I was lucky if they didn't throw me off the pier. They didn't want to hear about it. But then it started to hit home. Now fishermen [[Page S954]] come to me and say: Sheldon, it is getting weird out there. Sheldon, this is not my grandfather's ocean any longer. These are men who fished with their grandfathers, who fished with their fathers, and who now have their own boats. They know these waters, and when they say that the ocean has changed and it is getting weird out there, we should listen. They are on the water every day, and they see these changes happen before their very eyes. I hope my Republican colleagues are like those fishermen. I am sure some of them probably want to throw me off a pier for all these talks, but mostly they probably just don't want to hear about climate change. But what I am hoping is that soon they will hear it from the fishermen in their own States, or their farmers or their foresters, and that they will hear it from their State health officials, their State emergency officials, their own State universities, and they will listen. When they do, they will realize the fossil fuel industry has been duplicitous with them and has been leading them away from their own State's best interests. They will learn that the fossil fuel industry lobbyists are false friends as well as greedy ones. We have a clear scientific understanding of the problem. Yet relentless fossil fuel opposition prevents us from moving toward a solution. It is a disgrace, frankly. It is time to pay attention to reality, to the evidence, to what our farmers and foresters, and, yes, our fishermen are telling us. It is time to shut off the toxic polluter-paid politics that cloud this issue and give Washington a dirty name. It is time, indeed, to wake up. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DAINES.

Among its harms, this excess carbon dioxide has a particularly damaging chemical effect on our oceans. Oceans, in addition to absorbing 90 percent of the heat, I pointed out, are absorbing about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide--it goes right into the oceans--roughly 600 gigatons since preindustrial times. As all that carbon is absorbed into the oceans, it changes the oceans' chemistry. It makes the oceans more acidic. The chemical reaction is simple, but the effects on the ocean are serious. This chart shows ocean pH--or acidity--over the past 25 million years, and we can see some variation across those millions of years. This is what is projected for the next 100 years: pH drops equals acidity rises. According to a research article published in the journal Nature Geoscience, the rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at any time recorded in the past 50 million years. Scientists go back and they can see this in the geologic record. We have broken every record for 50 million years--millions of years before human beings were ever on the planet. This all may sound esoteric, but it has real hometown consequences for Rhode Island, where coastal life defines our heritage, our culture, and our economy. Fishing is big business in my State. Rhode Island's annual farmed oyster production, for instance, is valued at over $5 million. But carbon pollution is changing the very chemistry in which those oysters must survive. Research on the effects of ocean acidification on shellfish and other marine life can barely keep up with a rapidly acidifying ocean--another reason we need more money for research. Change is coming at us faster. We have to speed up the pace of research to understand it. But what we do know is that shellfish, such as mussels, clams, and oysters, make their shells from calcium carbonate, and calcium carbonate dissolves in acidified seawater. Here is how Bob Rheault, executive director of the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association, put it: The only thing we know for sure is that the larvae, in that first 48-hour period before they start feeding, are tremendously susceptible to dissolution. Their energy budget goes negative because they haven't started to feed yet, and if they haven't got enough energy in that egg and they're starting to dissolve, then it takes extra energy to lay down shell, and they sometimes don't make it. Here we see normal, healthy oyster larvae in those first few crucial days of development, compared to larvae growing in more acidic ocean water. NOAA scientists have projected that the world's oceans and coastal estuaries will become 150 percent more acidic by 2100. This could mean disaster for shellfish--a $1 billion industry around the country. U.S. shellfish production is currently expected to see a 10- to 25-percent reduction in the next five decades, according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Again, pardon me for being serious about this, but it is currently predicted that a major industry in my State is going to be knocked down 10 to 25 percent because we are making our oceans acidic with carbon pollution. A study published last year found that Rhode Island's shellfish populations are especially vulnerable. Mark Gibson is the deputy chief of marine fisheries at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, and he calls ocean acidification a ``significant threat'' to local fisheries. I don't know how many Senators are expected to forget or ignore a significant threat to an industry in their home State because it is inconvenient for lobbyists and for the fossil fuel industry, but I don't think that is a fair thing to ask of me. But acidification is not the only problem for fishermen. In a 2015 survey from the Center for American Progress, 40 percent of fishermen in the Northeast reported catching new fish species they don't usually see in the waters they fish. Rhode Islanders are starting to catch tarpon and grouper, usually tropical fish; our valuable winter flounder fishery is virtually gone; and our lobstermen have to go farther and farther out to sea to find cooler waters where they can catch their lobsters. Among the fishermen surveyed, 80 percent of those who noticed ``warmer water temperatures'' attribute it to climate change. This is new. When I first got to the Senate, if I went down to Galilee--Rhode Island's largest fishing port--and tried to talk to the fishermen there about climate change or ocean acidification, I was lucky if they didn't throw me off the pier. They didn't want to hear about it. But then it started to hit home. Now fishermen [[Page S954]] come to me and say: Sheldon, it is getting weird out there. Sheldon, this is not my grandfather's ocean any longer. These are men who fished with their grandfathers, who fished with their fathers, and who now have their own boats. They know these waters, and when they say that the ocean has changed and it is getting weird out there, we should listen. They are on the water every day, and they see these changes happen before their very eyes. I hope my Republican colleagues are like those fishermen. I am sure some of them probably want to throw me off a pier for all these talks, but mostly they probably just don't want to hear about climate change. But what I am hoping is that soon they will hear it from the fishermen in their own States, or their farmers or their foresters, and that they will hear it from their State health officials, their State emergency officials, their own State universities, and they will listen. When they do, they will realize the fossil fuel industry has been duplicitous with them and has been leading them away from their own State's best interests. They will learn that the fossil fuel industry lobbyists are false friends as well as greedy ones. We have a clear scientific understanding of the problem. Yet relentless fossil fuel opposition prevents us from moving toward a solution. It is a disgrace, frankly. It is time to pay attention to reality, to the evidence, to what our farmers and foresters, and, yes, our fishermen are telling us. It is time to shut off the toxic polluter-paid politics that cloud this issue and give Washington a dirty name. It is time, indeed, to wake up. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DAINES.

record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] climate change mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i am here now for the 128th time to urge that we wake up to the ugly changes that carbon pollution is wreaking on our climate. it is happening all around us, and it is happening right now, not in some far-off future. as humans we are terrestrial beings. we live on the land. so naturally we pay more attention to the experience where we live--things such as increasing average temperatures on the land and changes in extreme weather when it hits the land. we don't so much pay attention to what is happening in our warming and acidifying oceans. the oceans are a big deal in climate change. for decades the oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions. of all the different places the excess heat goes, 93 percent is into the oceans. what we see in the atmosphere--the temperature changes we have already measured, the [[page s953]] changes we are seeing in our habitat and what is happening to the western forest--all of that is less than the remaining 7 percent. a study published in the journal nature climate change found that the oceans have absorbed as much energy just since 1997 as they had in the preceding 130 years--as much in 20 years, less than 20 years, as they had in the preceding 130 years. according to an associated press write-up of the study's findings, ``since 1997, earth's oceans have absorbed man-made heat energy equivalent to a hiroshima-style bomb being exploded every second for 75 straight years.'' that is the energy load of heat that has gone into our oceans--a hiroshima-style bomb exploded every second for 75 straight years. what does all that excess energy mean for the oceans? it means that sea levels are rising, in part due to melting glaciers but also because of expanding ocean water. it is basic physics, explained by the principle of thermal expansion. when the ocean warms, it expands. it can't go down, so it comes up along our shores. we have measured sea level rise in rhode island since 1930. since then, the water level is up nearly 10 inches at the tide gauge at naval station newport, and rates of sea level rise are on the increase worldwide. since 1993, global sea level has risen at a rate approximately double the average rate observed through the 20th century. it is accelerating. current forecasts confirm that if we do nothing to curb greenhouse gas emissions over the next decades, the oceans could rise as much as 3 or 4 feet by 2100. our state coastal management agency predicts that we could see as much as 7 feet of sea level rise in the ocean state, in rhode island, by the end of the century. i hope my colleagues understand that when i come to do this, i am deadly serious about things that are predicted to happen in my state. this week, the proceedings of the national academy of sciences reported that global sea levels are rising at their fastest rate in nearly 3,000 years. that study also estimates that about half of the 20th century sea level rise would not have occurred without global warming. the lead author, dr. robert kopp, an earth scientist at rutgers university, explained in the new york times: physics tells us that sea-level change and temperature change should go hand-in-hand. this new geological record confirms it. sea level rise matters to my constituents and to all coastal communities. a related study, led by dr. robert strauss, found that approximately three-quarters of the tidal flood days now occurring in towns along the east coast are a result of the rise in sea level caused by human emissions. for example, looking at tide gauge data, 32 flood days were recorded in the decade from 1955 to 1964 at annapolis, md, and 34 flood days were recorded in that same period for charleston, sc. in one decade, there were 32 flood days in annapolis and 34 flood days in charleston. scroll forward to the decade 2005 to 2014, and the number of flood days in annapolis jumps to 394 from 32--in one decade-- and 219 flood days were recorded in charleston. sea level rise brings coastal erosion, and it brings saltwater inundation of coastal marshes and habitats. it amplifies the effects of storm surge and flooding as storms ride ashore on higher seas. it changes flood zones and affects flood insurance for homeowners. these are real problems, and they are serious problems. dr. strauss explains in a new york times article this week: it's not the tide. it's not the wind. it's us. the main culprit is carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere, which again in 2015 reached new record levels. to put a little context on this, for as long as human beings have inhabited planet earth, we have existed safely in a range between 170 and 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. unfortunately, we broke beyond 300 parts per million early last century, and we

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS954-3,CREC-2016-02-23,114,ENSURING PATIENT ACCESS AND EFFECTIVE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S954-S955] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENSURING PATIENT ACCESS AND EFFECTIVE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ACT Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss S. 483, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, which the Judiciary Committee reported out by voice vote right before we went into recess. At the outset, I would like to thank Senator Whitehouse for his important work on this bill. He and his staff have been crucial partners in helping to move this legislation forward. S. 483 will bring much-needed clarity to several key provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. In particular, it will better delineate the standards a company must satisfy in order to obtain a Controlled Substances Act registration and the circumstances under which a registration may be suspended without an adjudicative proceeding. To elaborate briefly on this second point, under the terms of the Controlled Substances Act, the Attorney General may suspend a registration to manufacture or distribute controlled substances without court process if she determines there is an imminent danger to the public health and safety, but the Controlled Substances Act does not define what constitutes an imminent danger. S. 483 clarifies the Attorney General's authority under this provision by specifying that imminent danger means that, ``due to failure of the registrant to maintain effective controls against diversion or otherwise comply with the obligations of a registrant under this title or title III, there is a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur in the absence of an immediate suspension of the registration.'' It is the intent of the bill authors that the phrase ``substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur'' include situations where evidence of diversion indicates there is a substantial likelihood that abuse of a controlled substance will occur--that is it is the intent of the authors that this language authorize the Attorney General to issue an immediate suspension order in cases where evidence of diversion points to a substantial likelihood of abuse, provided the other conditions for issuing such an order are met. In addition to these important clarifications, S. 483 will also facilitate greater collaboration between registrants and relevant Federal actors in combatting prescription drug abuse. In particular, the bill provides a mechanism for companies who inadvertently violate the Controlled Substances Act to submit a corrective action plan to remediate the violation before their registration is suspended and the supply of drugs to patients is interrupted. This provision will encourage greater self-reporting of violations and promote joint efforts between government and private actors to stem the tide of prescription drug abuse. It will also help ensure that supply chains remain intact for legitimate uses such as the alleviation of pain and illness. S. 483 takes a balanced approach to the problem of prescription drug abuse. It clarifies and further defines the Attorney General's enforcement powers while seeking to avoid situations that may lead to an interruption in the supply of medicine to suffering patients.

Mr. President, today I wish to discuss S. 483, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, which the Judiciary Committee reported out by voice vote right before we went into recess. At the outset, I would like to thank Senator Whitehouse for his important work on this bill. He and his staff have been crucial partners in helping to move this legislation forward. S. 483 will bring much-needed clarity to several key provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. In particular, it will better delineate the standards a company must satisfy in order to obtain a Controlled Substances Act registration and the circumstances under which a registration may be suspended without an adjudicative proceeding. To elaborate briefly on this second point, under the terms of the Controlled Substances Act, the Attorney General may suspend a registration to manufacture or distribute controlled substances without court process if she determines there is an imminent danger to the public health and safety, but the Controlled Substances Act does not define what constitutes an imminent danger. S. 483 clarifies the Attorney General's authority under this provision by specifying that imminent danger means that, ``due to failure of the registrant to maintain effective controls against diversion or otherwise comply with the obligations of a registrant under this title or title III, there is a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur in the absence of an immediate suspension of the registration.'' It is the intent of the bill authors that the phrase ``substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur'' include situations where evidence of diversion indicates there is a substantial likelihood that abuse of a controlled substance will occur--that is it is the intent of the authors that this language authorize the Attorney General to issue an immediate suspension order in cases where evidence of diversion points to a substantial likelihood of abuse, provided the other conditions for issuing such an order are met. In addition to these important clarifications, S. 483 will also facilitate greater collaboration between registrants and relevant Federal actors in combatting prescription drug abuse. In particular, the bill provides a mechanism for companies who inadvertently violate the Controlled Substances Act to submit a corrective action plan to remediate the violation before their registration is suspended and the supply of drugs to patients is interrupted. This provision will encourage greater self-reporting of violations and promote joint efforts between government and private actors to stem the tide of prescription drug abuse. It will also help ensure that supply chains remain intact for legitimate uses such as the alleviation of pain and illness. S. 483 takes a balanced approach to the problem of prescription drug abuse. It clarifies and further defines the Attorney General's enforcement powers while seeking to avoid situations that may lead to an interruption in the supply of medicine to suffering patients. It reflects a measured, carefully negotiated compromise between stakeholders and law enforcement that will enable both to work together more effectively. I thank Senator Whitehouse again for his work on this bill and urge my colleagues to give it their strong support.

Mr. President, we have witnessed in this administration Executive overreach with increasing boldness. One manifestation of Executive overreach is the shocking indifference with which departmental agencies spurn the congressionally mandated rulemaking processes in favor of regulating under the guise of ``guidance documents.'' Guidance documents in their proper form advise the public of their obligations under existing law and, therefore, merely interpret the law without imposing any additional obligation. Agencies are quick to echo that guidance documents do not have the force and effect of law; yet governmentwide, agencies increasingly have used guidance as an end-run around the rulemaking process in violation of Federal law. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is such an offender. Their guidance documents, including Dear Colleague letters on harassment and bullying, issued October 23, 2010, and sexual violence, issued April 4, 2011, purport to merely interpret title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, yet advance troublesome policies not contemplated by the text of title IX or its implementing regulations. I appreciate the fact that these guidance documents predated Mr. King's service at the Department of Education, and I do not assert that he had any role in developing or issuing the letters. However, in a letter dated January 7, 2016, I asked him to clarify his role as Acting Secretary, in no uncertain terms, that the policies expounded in the 2010 and 2011 letters not required by the terms of title IX cannot be grounds for any adverse action. To my disappointment, his response failed to do so. Mr. King should commit to use the office of the Secretary to rein in the regulatory abuses within the Department of Education and encourage his Cabinet counterparts to do the same. Until such time as such commitments are made, I intend to object to his nomination. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S955] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NOMINATION OBJECTION Mr. LANKFORD.

Mr. President, I wish to offer a few words remembering Associate Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court. America has lost a legal giant and tireless defender of the Constitution. Justice Scalia dedicated his life to his country and the rule of law. His passing is a significant loss for the Court and the United States. Few Associate Justices of the Supreme Court capture the attention of both lawyers and non-lawyers like Justice Scalia has throughout his career. Antonin Scalia used wit, humor, and colorful writing to captivate Americans in his judicial opinions and educational talks. Justice Scalia also felt strongly about protecting the rights of the individual and did so in monumental opinions interpreting the First, Second, Fourth, and Sixth Amendments. In the immediate days following his passing, I received substantial correspondence from Wyoming residents praising his work for upholding the Constitution and defending individual liberties. A number of my colleagues have already mentioned how Justice Scalia would always put the Constitution first, even if it conflicted with his personal views. This was the case when Justice Scalia voted to uphold the right of protesters to burn the American flag--even though he strongly disagreed with flag desecration. When it comes to privacy, Justice Scalia established himself as a leading champion of the Fourth Amendment, particularly when it comes to privacy in one's home or car. Justice Scalia also authored a landmark majority opinion upholding gun rights under the Second Amendment which reiterated the constitutional right of an individual to keep and bear arms in the District of Columbia, a right which was later incorporated to all States. Justice Scalia also fought ardently for religious freedoms under the Establishment Clause and joined others in upholding freedom of association under the First Amendment. From his earliest days on the Supreme Court, Scalia approached the Constitution and statutes passed by Congress as a textualist. He protected the vertical separation of power in our federalist system which keeps decisions closer to the people and fought for the separation of powers amongst the three branches of Federal Government. Most recently, Justice Scalia challenged Executive overreach in the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court invalidating President Obama's unconstitutional recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Finally, Justice Scalia's writings, judicial philosophy, and lectures have influenced future generations of lawyers and jurists. Whether, during oral argument, asking if the government can ``make people buy broccoli'' or referencing Cole Porter lyrics in opinions, Scalia used words to rebut, challenge, and persuade. Justice Scalia's legacy and legal precedents will stand the test of time, and our Nation owes him a debt of gratitude for his service. My wife, Diana, and I send our prayers and condolences to the Scalia family. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S955] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 40th anniversary of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Incorporated, CBCF. It is fitting that during the month we celebrate Black history, we commemorate the decades of service CBCF has rendered to the Nation by advancing policy issues that impact the global Black community. Black History Month is an ideal time to reflect on the ways the law has shaped the African-American experience. Our Nation has come a long way since the time when schools were segregated by law. No longer does the law bar African Americans from the voting booth. Today we have African-American Members of Congress who help craft the law; Yet the important work of civil rights remains unfinished. Since 1976, CBCF has been a critical partner with Congress in the fight for equal rights. As a nonpartisan nonprofit institute dedicated to eliminating racial disparities, CBCF has served as an inspiration to not just African Americans, but to people across the globe. However, its legacy and impact have been far from symbolic. From helping to make the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a Federal holiday, to rebuilding communities impacted by Hurricane Katrina, to working on major legislation like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to building a virtual library project to shed a spotlight on the work of Black-elected officials, CBCF has stood alongside African-American elected leaders on some of the most critical policy issues of our time. As we move in 2016, the work of CBCF is more important than ever. Today people of color face disparities in the areas of criminal justice reform, voting rights, and economic development both at home and abroad. Its founders--Nira Hardon Long, Albert Nellum, and Congresswoman Yvonne Burke--envisioned CBCF as an important contributor in the quest for racial equality. The need remains. The vision lives on. And we have more work to do. I am confident CBCF will continue to serve our country admirably and protect African Americans vigorously.

Mr. President, I would like to extend my sincere thanks for the continued involvement of Vermont high school teachers and principals in my annual State of the Union essay contest. This year, 799 Vermont students from 39 high schools wrote essays detailing what they thought were the most important issues facing our country. We could not have achieved this level of participation without the help of engaged educators throughout the State. Each and every day, teachers encourage students to think critically and develop their own ideas. I appreciate that so many teachers have used the essay contest to challenge their students to share what they consider to be priorities for the United States. This year's submissions were some of the most thoughtful to date, and I have no doubt that is because of the encouragement of engaged teachers from across the State. The success of this essay contest also depends on a dedicated team of volunteer judges, all of whom are also high school teachers. This year, we asked our five judges--some of whom have served for many years--to read more essays in less time, and we greatly appreciate the serious consideration and commitment they brought to the task. I would like to take a moment to recognize this year's judges: Bradley Archer, Woodstock Union High School; Jason Gorczyk, Milton High School; Krista Huling, South Burlington High School; Roberta ``Cookie'' Steponaitis, Vergennes Union High School; and Terri Vest, Twinfield Union School. I would also like to enter into the Record the names of the 39 high schools that participated this year: Arlington Memorial High School, Bellows Falls Union High School, Bellows Free Academy--Fairfax, Blue Mountain High School, Burlington High School, Burlington Technical Center, Burr & Burton Academy, Canaan Memorial High School, Champlain Valley Union High School, Colchester High School, Enosburg Falls High School, Green Mountain Technology and Career Center, Hanover High School, Hartford High School, Harwood Union High School, Leland and Gray Union High School, Mill River Union High School, Milton High School, Missisquoi Valley Union High School, Mount Mansfield Union High School, Mt.

Additionally, I would like to thank the schools where an especially large number of students wrote essays. Vermont Commons School and Missisquoi Valley Union High School had more than 25 participants. Green Mountain Technology and Career Center and South Burlington High School both had more than 50 students write essays. Mount Abraham Union High School had more than 100 members of their freshmen class write essays. Rutland High School assigned the contest to their entire freshmen class, with more than 200 students participating.

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgS961-2,CREC-2016-02-23,114,Introductory Statement on S. 2568,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S961-S962] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: S. 2568. A bill to provide for conservation, enhanced recreation opportunities, and development of renewable energy in the California Desert Conservation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the California Desert Conservation and Recreation Act. In February of 2015, I, along with Sen. Boxer, introduced a bill under the same name. That bill from 2015 included a number of conservation and recreation provisions that the President could not include in his recent designation of three national monuments. The President's designation this past month of those new national monuments--Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow, and Castle Mountain--was a major milestone in our efforts to protect the desert. But, due to limitations under the Antiquities Act, the President's executive action left out several key parts of our desert bill from 2015. These remaining provisions were vital to many of the groups and organizations that came together to support our bill in 2015. I made a commitment to those groups to enact the entire bill, not just parts of the bill. And I intend to fulfill that promise. The remaining provisions included in today's legislation do the following: enhance recreational opportunities by establishing 142,000 acres of permanent Off-Highway Vehicle recreation areas; further expand wilderness areas in the desert, by designating five additional wilderness areas that cover 230,000 acres of land near Fort Irwin; ensure clean and free-flowing rivers, through the designation of 77 miles of rivers as Wild and Scenic Rivers; add to our national parks, by expanding Death Valley National Park Wilderness by 39,000 acres and Joshua Tree National Park by 4,500 acres; expand National Scenic Areas, by adding 18,610 acres to the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo County; protect important cultural resources, by requiring the Department of the Interior to protect petroglyphs and other cultural resources in San Bernardino and Imperial County; and, facilitate renewable energy development in a way that protects delicate habitat. I want to be very clear: I intend to continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate and House to advance this important bill and the wilderness protections, national park additions, recreation area designations and other renewable energy provisions that were not implemented through the Antiquities Act. This legislation balances the many competing uses for public lands across the California desert: It protects fragile ecosystems and significant cultural resources, provides for increased recreational opportunities, and encourages sensible renewable energy development. This current bill includes all of the carefully negotiated provisions from the bill I introduced in February, minus the three monuments. This bill reflects our attempt to achieve consensus among the competing uses of desert land and the many stakeholders involved, including environmental groups, State and local governments, the off- road community, cattle ranchers, mining interests, the Defense Department, energy companies, California's public utility companies, and many others. As a result of the general public's robust participation, we have put together a bipartisan proposal that charts a commonsense path forward for the California desert. We made a commitment to these stakeholders to enact these commonsense solutions, and I intend to follow through on that promise. I want to highlight some of the key provisions of this legislation: By designating five new wilderness areas, this bill protects fragile desert ecosystems across 230,000 acres of wilderness near Fort Irwin. This includes 88,000 acres of Avawatz Mountains, 8,000-acre Great Falls Basin Wilderness, the 80,000-acre Soda Mountains Wilderness, and the 32,500-acre Death Valley Wilderness. These proposed wilderness areas have something for everyone: Desert solitude; abundant hiking options and rock climbing routes; and horseback riding and hunting for those that wish to experience a truly remarkable backcountry experience. This bill is more than just wilderness, however. It also designates four new wild and scenic rivers, totaling 77 miles in length. These rivers and creeks are important, and rare, riparian areas in the heart of the arid desert. This designation will ensure that those rivers and creeks remain clean and free-flowing and that their immediate environments are preserved. These beautiful waterways are Deep Creek and the Whitewater River in and near the San Bernardino National Forest, as well as the Amargosa River and Surprise Canyon Creek near Death Valley National Park. Conserving pristine desert land such as this is most definitely in the interests of our country. The California desert is a very special place and it deserves to stay that way. The legislation also provides permanent protection for five existing Off-Highway Vehicle Areas covering approximately 142,000 acres. The bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing wilderness study area designation in response to requests from local government and recreation users. This will allow the land to be made available for other purposes, including recreational off-highway vehicle use on designated routes. Although the President's recent executive action could not include these permanent protections, off- roaders are a vital part of the coalition we put together. They deserve certainty about their future enjoyment of the land, just as conservationists now have certainty as a result of the monument designations. With this bill introduction, I renew my pledge to work closely with the off-road community. We must also take into account another use of the desert land: renewable energy. And I believe that we can accomplish the twin aims of honoring our commitment to conservation and fulfilling California's pledge to develop a clean energy portfolio. Balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we just need to come up with the right solutions. Thankfully, some of these compromises are already in place. [[Page S962]] By April 2009, solar and wind companies had proposed 28 projects to be included in the Mojave Trails National Monument, including sites on former Catellus lands intended for permanent conservation. I visited some of those sites at the time, including one particularly beautiful area known as the Broadwell Valley, where thousands of acres of pristine lands were proposed for development. Seeing it first hand, I quickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the right place for renewable energy development. Since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. Let me explain why this happened. First, the Energy and Interior Departments developed new solar energy zones. These zones allow projects to be developed on lands least likely to harm plant and wildlife species, and allow projects to be completed faster and with fewer conflicts. This is a smart compromise. Second, California has worked closely with Federal agencies to develop the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan. This blueprint will help identify pristine lands that warrant protection and direct energy projects elsewhere. This is a fair balancing of priorities, and I think it provides a clear path forward. The bill I am introducing also takes additional action to help promote responsible renewable energy development through state land exchanges. There are currently about 370,000 acres of isolated parcels of state lands spread across the California desert. These state-owned lands are largely unusable, due to their location inside Federal national parks, wilderness, monuments, and conservation areas. The bill addresses this problem by requiring the Department of the Interior to develop and implement a plan with the state to exchange these state lands for other BLM or General Services Administration owned property in the next ten years. By swapping state land that is often surrounded by wilderness and national parks for other federal land, these exchanges will provide California with sites for renewable energy production, recreation or other uses. I strongly urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to take a hard look at this legislation. We have made great strides in the past twenty years to strike the right balance between desert conservation, recreational uses, and the development of our natural resources. I believe this legislation continues in that fine tradition. Built on a foundation of consensus and compromise, this legislation fulfills our promise to the next generation that they will have the same opportunities to indulge in the best the California desert has to offer. I am hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it forward. It's the right thing to do. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S961-S962] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: S. 2568.

abundant hiking options and rock climbing routes; and horseback riding and hunting for those that wish to experience a truly remarkable backcountry experience. this bill is more than just wilderness, however. it also designates four new wild and scenic rivers, totaling 77 miles in length. these rivers and creeks are important, and rare, riparian areas in the heart of the arid desert. this designation will ensure that those rivers and creeks remain clean and free-flowing and that their immediate environments are preserved. these beautiful waterways are deep creek and the whitewater river in and near the san bernardino national forest, as well as the amargosa river and surprise canyon creek near death valley national park. conserving pristine desert land such as this is most definitely in the interests of our country. the california desert is a very special place and it deserves to stay that way. the legislation also provides permanent protection for five existing off-highway vehicle areas covering approximately 142,000 acres. the bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing wilderness study area designation in response to requests from local government and recreation users. this will allow the land to be made available for other purposes, including recreational off-highway vehicle use on designated routes. although the president's recent executive action could not include these permanent protections, off- roaders are a vital part of the coalition we put together. they deserve certainty about their future enjoyment of the land, just as conservationists now have certainty as a result of the monument designations. with this bill introduction, i renew my pledge to work closely with the off-road community. we must also take into account another use of the desert land: renewable energy. and i believe that we can accomplish the twin aims of honoring our commitment to conservation and fulfilling california's pledge to develop a clean energy portfolio. balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we just need to come up with the right solutions. thankfully, some of these compromises are already in place. [[page s962]] by april 2009, solar and wind companies had proposed 28 projects to be included in the mojave trails national monument, including sites on former catellus lands intended for permanent conservation. i visited some of those sites at the time, including one particularly beautiful area known as the broadwell valley, where thousands of acres of pristine lands were proposed for development. seeing it first hand, i quickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the right place for renewable energy development. since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. let me explain why this happened. first, the energy and interior departments developed new solar energy zones. these zones allow projects to be developed on lands least likely to harm plant and wildlife species, and allow projects to be completed faster and with fewer conflicts. this is a smart compromise. second, california has worked closely with federal agencies to develop the desert renewable energy conservation plan. this blueprint will help identify pristine lands that warrant protection and direct energy projects elsewhere. this is a fair balancing of priorities, and i think it provides a clear path forward. the bill i am introducing also takes additional action to help promote responsible renewable energy development through state land exchanges. there are currently about 370,000 acres of isolated parcels of state lands spread across the california desert. these state-owned lands are largely unusable, due to their location inside federal national parks, wilderness, monuments, and conservation areas. the bill addresses this problem by requiring the department of the interior to develop and implement a plan with the state to exchange these state lands for other blm or general services administration owned property in the next ten years. by swapping state land that is often surrounded by wilderness and national parks for other federal land, these exchanges will provide california with sites for renewable energy production, recreation or other uses. i strongly urge my colleagues in both the house and the senate to take a hard look at this legislation. we have made great strides in the past twenty years to strike the right balance between desert conservation, recreational uses, and the development of our natural resources. i believe this legislation continues in that fine tradition. built on a foundation of consensus and compromise, this legislation fulfills our promise to the next generation that they will have the same opportunities to indulge in the best the california desert has to offer. i am hopeful this congress will take this legislation up and move it forward. it's the right thing to do. ____________________",9103

A bill to provide for conservation, enhanced recreation opportunities, and development of renewable energy in the California Desert Conservation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the California Desert Conservation and Recreation Act. In February of 2015, I, along with Sen. Boxer, introduced a bill under the same name. That bill from 2015 included a number of conservation and recreation provisions that the President could not include in his recent designation of three national monuments. The President's designation this past month of those new national monuments--Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow, and Castle Mountain--was a major milestone in our efforts to protect the desert. But, due to limitations under the Antiquities Act, the President's executive action left out several key parts of our desert bill from 2015. These remaining provisions were vital to many of the groups and organizations that came together to support our bill in 2015. I made a commitment to those groups to enact the entire bill, not just parts of the bill. And I intend to fulfill that promise. The remaining provisions included in today's legislation do the following: enhance recreational opportunities by establishing 142,000 acres of permanent Off-Highway Vehicle recreation areas; further expand wilderness areas in the desert, by designating five additional wilderness areas that cover 230,000 acres of land near Fort Irwin; ensure clean and free-flowing rivers, through the designation of 77 miles of rivers as Wild and Scenic Rivers; add to our national parks, by expanding Death Valley National Park Wilderness by 39,000 acres and Joshua Tree National Park by 4,500 acres; expand National Scenic Areas, by adding 18,610 acres to the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo County; protect important cultural resources, by requiring the Department of the Interior to protect petroglyphs and other cultural resources in San Bernardino and Imperial County; and, facilitate renewable energy development in a way that protects delicate habitat.

Balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we just need to come up with the right solutions. Thankfully, some of these compromises are already in place. [[Page S962]] By April 2009, solar and wind companies had proposed 28 projects to be included in the Mojave Trails National Monument, including sites on former Catellus lands intended for permanent conservation. I visited some of those sites at the time, including one particularly beautiful area known as the Broadwell Valley, where thousands of acres of pristine lands were proposed for development. Seeing it first hand, I quickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the right place for renewable energy development. Since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. Let me explain why this happened. First, the Energy and Interior Departments developed new solar energy zones. These zones allow projects to be developed on lands least likely to harm plant and wildlife species, and allow projects to be completed faster and with fewer conflicts. This is a smart compromise. Second, California has worked closely with Federal agencies to develop the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan. This blueprint will help identify pristine lands that warrant protection and direct energy projects elsewhere. This is a fair balancing of priorities, and I think it provides a clear path forward. The bill I am introducing also takes additional action to help promote responsible renewable energy development through state land exchanges. There are currently about 370,000 acres of isolated parcels of state lands spread across the California desert. These state-owned lands are largely unusable, due to their location inside Federal national parks, wilderness, monuments, and conservation areas. The bill addresses this problem by requiring the Department of the Interior to develop and implement a plan with the state to exchange these state lands for other BLM or General Services Administration owned property in the next ten years. By swapping state land that is often surrounded by wilderness and national parks for other federal land, these exchanges will provide California with sites for renewable energy production, recreation or other uses. I strongly urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to take a hard look at this legislation. We have made great strides in the past twenty years to strike the right balance between desert conservation, recreational uses, and the development of our natural resources. I believe this legislation continues in that fine tradition. Built on a foundation of consensus and compromise, this legislation fulfills our promise to the next generation that they will have the same opportunities to indulge in the best the California desert has to offer. I am hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it forward. It's the right thing to do. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,9156,9156,9227,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [senate] [pages s961-s962] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions by mrs. feinstein: s. 2568. a bill to provide for conservation, enhanced recreation opportunities, and development of renewable energy in the california desert conservation area, and for other purposes; to the committee on energy and natural resources. mrs. feinstein. mr. president, today i am proud to introduce the california desert conservation and recreation act. in february of 2015, i, along with sen. boxer, introduced a bill under the same name. that bill from 2015 included a number of conservation and recreation provisions that the president could not include in his recent designation of three national monuments. the president's designation this past month of those new national monuments--mojave trails, sand to snow, and castle mountain--was a major milestone in our efforts to protect the desert. but, due to limitations under the antiquities act, the president's executive action left out several key parts of our desert bill from 2015. these remaining provisions were vital to many of the groups and organizations that came together to support our bill in 2015. i made a commitment to those groups to enact the entire bill, not just parts of the bill. and i intend to fulfill that promise. the remaining provisions included in today's legislation do the following: enhance recreational opportunities by establishing 142,000 acres of permanent off-highway vehicle recreation areas; further expand wilderness areas in the desert, by designating five additional wilderness areas that cover 230,000 acres of land near fort irwin; ensure clean and free-flowing rivers, through the designation of 77 miles of rivers as wild and scenic rivers; add to our national parks, by expanding death valley national park wilderness by 39,000 acres and joshua tree national park by 4,500 acres; expand national scenic areas, by adding 18,610 acres to the alabama hills national scenic area in inyo county; protect important cultural resources, by requiring the department of the interior to protect petroglyphs and other cultural resources in san bernardino and imperial county; and, facilitate renewable energy development in a way that protects delicate habitat. i want to be very clear: i intend to continue to work with my colleagues in the senate and house to advance this important bill and the wilderness protections, national park additions, recreation area designations and other renewable energy provisions that were not implemented through the antiquities act. this legislation balances the many competing uses for public lands across the california desert: it protects fragile ecosystems and significant cultural resources, provides for increased recreational opportunities, and encourages sensible renewable energy development. this current bill includes all of the carefully negotiated provisions from the bill i introduced in february, minus the three monuments. this bill reflects our attempt to achieve consensus among the competing uses of desert land and the many stakeholders involved, including environmental groups, state and local governments, the off- road community, cattle ranchers, mining interests, the defense department, energy companies, california's public utility companies, and many others. as a result of the general public's robust participation, we have put together a bipartisan proposal that charts a commonsense path forward for the california desert. we made a commitment to these stakeholders to enact these commonsense solutions, and i intend to follow through on that promise. i want to highlight some of the key provisions of this legislation: by designating five new wilderness areas, this bill protects fragile desert ecosystems across 230,000 acres of wilderness near fort irwin. this includes 88,000 acres of avawatz mountains, 8,000-acre great falls basin wilderness, the 80,000-acre soda mountains wilderness, and the 32,500-acre death valley wilderness. these proposed wilderness areas have something for everyone: desert solitude; abundant hiking options and rock climbing routes; and horseback riding and hunting for those that wish to experience a truly remarkable backcountry experience. this bill is more than just wilderness, however. it also designates four new wild and scenic rivers, totaling 77 miles in length. these rivers and creeks are important, and rare, riparian areas in the heart of the arid desert. this designation will ensure that those rivers and creeks remain clean and free-flowing and that their immediate environments are preserved. these beautiful waterways are deep creek and the whitewater river in and near the san bernardino national forest, as well as the amargosa river and surprise canyon creek near death valley national park. conserving pristine desert land such as this is most definitely in the interests of our country. the california desert is a very special place and it deserves to stay that way. the legislation also provides permanent protection for five existing off-highway vehicle areas covering approximately 142,000 acres. the bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing wilderness study area designation in response to requests from local government and recreation users. this will allow the land to be made available for other purposes, including recreational off-highway vehicle use on designated routes. although the president's recent executive action could not include these permanent protections, off- roaders are a vital part of the coalition we put together. they deserve certainty about their future enjoyment of the land, just as conservationists now have certainty as a result of the monument designations. with this bill introduction, i renew my pledge to work closely with the off-road community. we must also take into account another use of the desert land: renewable energy. and i believe that we can accomplish the twin aims of honoring our commitment to conservation and fulfilling california's pledge to develop a clean energy portfolio. balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we just need to come up with the right solutions. thankfully, some of these compromises are already in place.

KEITH ELLISON of minnesota in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the impact of VocalEssence, a Minneapolis-based vocal ensemble of international repute. Through their WITNESS program, they have taught, performed alongside, and serenaded more than 155,000 students throughout the Twin Cities over 26 years. The WITNESS vision began in 1991 with one school and one teaching artist. It has since grown to more than 40 schools and 9 teaching artists, impacting more than 5,000 students annually. The program provides diverse role models and increased exposure to the arts through performances and classroom workshops. For many students, WITNESS is their first opportunity to receive professional training or perform at a major concert hall. The program celebrates the contributions of African Americans to choral music--a rich history that has led to collaborations with James Earl Jones, Rita Dove, Billy Taylor, and countless others. This year, WITNESS is hosting the Morehouse College Glee Club. These young men from a Historically Black College are living proof of the world of possibility for students of color. Over 200 young men from six Twin Cities high schools will rehearse and perform alongside some of the brightest Black minds in our country. It is crucial that we celebrate Black culture; when we do, we must include Black youth at the helm. VocalEssence WITNESS does just that. I commend VocalEssence for the WITNESS program's success in educating, engaging and inspiring students in the Twin Cities. VocalEssence has given our community so much beauty through their music, and they continue to better our future through their top-notch community program WITNESS. I can't wait to see what they accomplish in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E183] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE VOCALESSENCE WITNESS PROGRAM ______ HON.

BILL PASCRELL, JR. of new jersey in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to your attention the outstanding achievements of Mr. Bruce DeMolli, who was being honored by the Murray Family and the New Jersey Department for Persons with Disabilities at their 46th Annual Dinner Dance on Sunday, February 21, 2016. Bruce joined the Our Lady of the Highway Knights of Columbus Council 3835 in Little Falls, based at Our Lady of the Holy Angels Church in 1984 and has been an active member ever since. He was installed as the N.J. Knights of Columbus State Deputy, becoming the state CEO of the Knights for the next two years. Bruce became a state officer 10 years ago when he was elected State Warden. He was instrumental in forming two new councils: Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Number 11943 in Wayne, New Jersey and the Immaculate Council Number 12211 in Clifton, New Jersey. From 2004-2006, Bruce served as the Chairman of the Paterson Federation Knights of Columbus. The Paterson Federation is a representation of the Councils in the counties of Morris, Passaic and Sussex. The Federation is dedicated to serving and providing all the councils within its boundaries the assistance needed to help them excel in all areas of Columbianism. In recognition for his faithful service to his church and community, Bruce was honored by Pope Benedict XVI as a Knight of Saint Gregory. Bruce has been married to his wife, Anna, for more than 40 years and they have one daughter, Bree, and two grandchildren, Tyler and Maya. Bruce's wife serves as director at Diocesan Catholic Charities' La Vida Childcare Centers I & II in Paterson. The Murray House is a great organization which supports a cause that is near and dear to me and my wife Elsie. They are the longest running group home in the State of New Jersey for adults with developmental disabilities. The fact that they have chosen to honor Bruce at their annual Dinner Dance is only fitting as he is a great servant in the cause of helping others. The job of a United States Congressman involves much that is rewarding, yet nothing compares to recognizing and commemorating the achievements of dedicated individuals such as Bruce DeMolli. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, Bruce's family, friends, and all those whose lives he has touched, and me, in recognizing his leadership, dedication, and loyalty to serving his community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E183] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BRUCE DeMOLLI ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor J. Brad Jones, Director of Continuous Process Improvement at Tobyhanna Army Depot. Brad will be retiring on March 3, 2016 after more than 37 years of service to the Department of the Army and Tobyhanna Army Depot. From the rank of first line supervisor to his most recent service as a Senior Director, Brad has been a key member of Tobyhanna for decades. Over the course of his career, Brad has made significant contributions to Tobyhanna Army Depot. His insight and input made him a valued member of each core team that developed and implemented plans to reorganize and modernize the installation as it evolved. In 1991, Brad was a member of the Department of Defense Study Team for the Consolidation of Ground Communications--Electronics, which established the foundation for pivotal Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decisions in 1995. He developed the strategy and tactics to defend Tobyhanna from the threat of closure and resulted in the transfer of U.S. Air Force work from California to Tobyhanna. In 2005, he was Team Leader of the Tobyhanna BRAC group, which resulted in the transfer of Navy and Marine Corps workload from two sites in California to Tobyhanna. Brad helped lead Tobyhanna's effort that resulted in the award of seven Shingo medals for manufacturing excellence and the 2012 Department of Army Lean-Six Sigma Excellence Award. Brad was a team leader in attaining accreditation and the continued certification of Tobyhanna Army Depot under International Standards Organization 9001 for Quality, as well as under Aerospace Standards 9100/9110. These standards of excellence helped Tobyhanna maintain its competitive edge. Brad was also known for his interpersonal skills with employees, labor officials, and managers. As Director of Personnel and Chief of Management Employee Relations, he was able to streamline processes and cut red tape. As Depot Operations Officer and Chief of Staff, he ensured success of the day-to-day mission and base support operations of the depot, while coordinating the administrative actions of the Tobyhanna Army Depot Command Group and Headquarters. It is an honor to recognize J. Brad Jones for such an extraordinary career. I am grateful for all of his efforts for the sake of our nation's military. I wish him the best, and may he enjoy a long and fulfilling retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E183] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF J.

KEITH ELLISON of minnesota in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, today marks one year since three young Americans were killed for their faith. On February 10th, 2015, Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha, and Razan Abu-Salha were murdered in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They were shot and killed because they were Muslim. Yusor was a graduate of North Carolina State University and planned on enrolling at the UNC Chapel Hill School of Dentistry, where her husband, Deah, was studying to become a dentist. Razan, Yusor's sister, was a student at NCSU as well. She was only 19 years old. These murders break my heart. They should be heartbreaking to every American. The tragedy in Chapel Hill shows us the stark reality of anti-Muslim bigotry: hate speech and scapegoating has real life consequences. Children are bullied in schools, houses of worship are vandalized, and people are killed for the way they dress or how they pray. Candidates for public office, public officials, and leaders are spewing hatred against American Muslims, calling for Muslim refugees to be banned from entering the country, or for Muslims living here-- including some that were born and raised as American--should carry ID cards or register their names in a database. This type of rhetoric is why our young children are afraid to go to school and why people are being killed because of how they look or how they pray. After the murder, some people in the press argued that it was over a parking dispute. I'm reminded of what Deah's brother, Farris, said: ``I can only accept Deah, Yusor, and Razan's murders as being over a parking dispute, if Rosa Parks's struggle was over a bus seat.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E184] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHAPEL HILL SHOOTING ______ HON.

Her energy was contagious and if I had to pick one word to describe her, I think ``sparkplug'' would be most fitting. She wanted all Democrats to work hard--and led by being an outstanding example, with strength and a big heart. And those who worked with her like I did knew that she would never hesitate to let someone know if she saw them slacking. She pushed everyone to do their best out of love--because she knew that's what our party deserved. We are all going to miss her--not just her leadership in our party, but also her spirit that encouraged us all to do more for our community and our party. Her contributions to creating a better world for others will last forever. Bunny took so many people under her wing, and I am honored to be one of them. And it is through all of us that her memory lives on. Our community, the state of Florida, and our nation are better because of Bunny, as are the lives of countless individuals who knew her.

ADAM B. SCHIFF of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Barbara Sykes, of Burbank, California, an accomplished volunteer and community leader who passed away on Thursday, February 11, 2016. Born in 1960, Barbara grew up in Toluca Lake, California. Barbara married Dave Golonski and they raised their three children in Burbank, where she and her husband became deeply involved in their community. Barbara was active in various charitable organizations, before, during and after Dave's service on the Burbank City Council. Generous with their time and resources, Barbara and Dave frequently hosted events at their home for several organizations that raised money for both local causes and others in need--I always looked forward to their annual holiday party that benefitted the Burbank Coordinating Council, Five Acres, the El Faro and Hacienda Orphanages of Tijuana, Mexico and the Kids International Foundation, of which Barbara was a founding member. Ms. Sykes had a passion for charities that benefitted children, and to that end, she was a founding board member of the Boys & Girls Club of Burbank and the Greater East Valley, an organization that she was steadfastly dedicated to and active in for over twenty years. Ms. Sykes was a longtime volunteer with the Family Service Agency of Burbank and the Burbank Coordinating Council, where she served as one of the key organizers for their holiday basket program, and created the council's ``Coins for Campers'' program. In addition, Barbara raised funds for the Condor Squadron, founded by her father, Richard T. Sykes, a local organization of aviation enthusiasts which flies World War II and other military airplanes in formation over veterans' events, memorial ceremonies and parades throughout the region. Barbara is survived by her mother, JoAnn Sykes, husband, Dave Golonski, children, Randi, Russell and John, son-in-law, Nathan Lowery, grandchildren, Grant and JoAnn, and her brothers and sisters, Edmond, Jeanne, Carol, Gene, Richard, John and Mary. Barbara is an irreplaceable member of the Burbank community, and her loss will be deeply felt by the many people whose lives she touched. I ask all Members to join me in remembering one of Burbank's most beloved citizens, Barbara Sykes. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E185] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A MEMORIAL TRIBUTE TO BARBARA SYKES ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Susan Gordon, a nationally recognized pediatrician, teacher, and equal rights advocate from Pomona, New York, who passed away January 25. Dr. Gordon opened her pediatric office in Haverstraw, New York after graduating from Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, D.C. In 1958 she started a 25-year career as an associate professor of pediatrics, first at New York Medical College and then at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Gordon served as a member of the National Panel on the Measurement of the Program Effects of Head Start and a member of the Board of Trustees of Nyack Hospital. Dr. Gordon was also a member and past president of the board at the Lexington School for the Deaf, and the School's Health Center was named in her honor. Dr. Gordon and her husband, Dr. Edmund W. Gordon, were champions for equal educational opportunity, working with a small group of concerned citizens in the late 50's and 60's to integrate the schools in the East Ramapo Central School District. Dr. Gordon was very active in the PTA and later was elected a member of the East Ramapo Central School District Board of Education, where she was elected and served as President for three years. The Drs. Gordon combined their medical and educational knowledge and talents to found the Harriet Tubman Child Health and Guidance Clinic in Harlem in the 1950's, and helped establish the Psycho-Educational Diagnostic Clinic for children at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (referred to as the Ambulatory Pediatrics Division). In addition to her work in medicine and education, Dr. Gordon devoted her time and talents to serving the Rockland County community, and her accomplishments brought her well-deserved recognition. Dr. Gordon was a long-standing board member and served as President of the Martin Luther King Multi-Purpose Center Board of Trustees, and on January 22, 2000, the classrooms and computer center at the Martin Luther King Multi- Purpose Center were dedicated as the Susan G. Gordon, M.D. Education Corridor. She was also one of three women recognized at the African American Chamber of Commerce of Westchester & Rockland Counties, Inc.'s 2000 Women's History Month luncheon. Dr. Gordon was the recipient of the 1999 ``Children's Champion Award,'' given by the Early Child Consortium of Rockland County, and in 2006 was inducted, along with her husband, into the Rockland County Civil Rights Hall of Fame. Most recently, the Drs. Gordon founded Gordon and Gordon Associates in Human Development, and their children established the CEJJES Institute and Library in Pomona to continue their parents' life work in the promotion of social justice, particularly as it pertains to health, education, and the environmental and material well being of marginalized communities.

Most recently, the Drs.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Mr. Raymond C. Rinaldi for his innumerable contributions to the constituents of my district and surrounding communities through his work with the Ronald McDonald House of Scranton. As a distinguished attorney in the region, he has consistently exemplified the partnership between private enterprise and community engagement in northeastern Pennsylvania. Admitted to the bar in 1965 and establishing his legal practice in 1972, Raymond has worked tirelessly to establish a firm distinguished by its principles. Through hard work, client loyalty, confidentiality, and strict ethics, Rinaldi & Poveromo, P.C. has become the symbol of client-focused legal services. Raymond's defining contribution to the community began nearly three decades ago when he embarked on a project with consequences no one could have foreseen. After being approached by Albert and Carol Mueller about the idea of opening a local Ronald McDonald House in Scranton, personal experience inspired him to engage in this important undertaking. Raymond and his wife Rosemarie dealt with medical issues after the birth of one of their sons, and encountering firsthand the difficulties parents encounter while seeing their child undergo medical treatment, it was apparent that assisting in the implementation of this project was nothing more than a selfless duty. Providing a ``home-away-from-home'' so families can stay close to their hospitalized children at no cost, the Ronald McDonald House of Scranton has assisted thousands of families in the area with food and lodging while caring for a loved one. Raymond's humble duty turned out to be a lifelong passion as he served on the organization's board of directors for nearly three decades, and continues to provide pro-bono legal services to this day. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize Mr. Raymond C. Rinaldi for his continued service to the community, as he has promoted an atmosphere where families can face the weight of medical emergencies together. His selfless dedication has impacted countless lives and I express my deepest gratitude for his service with the hope that Raymond's work will continue to be the gold standard of service to the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E186] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MR.

BILL BLAKE ______ HON. JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bill Blake, who passed away January 10, 2016 surrounded by his friends and loved ones. He was 65. Bill was born and raised in Merced. As a young man he worked on farms until joining the Merced Sheriff's Office in 1971 at the age of 21. Bill served eight sheriffs over a 38 year period, working all across Merced County including Los Banos and the surrounding West Side. In 2003 Bill was named undersheriff by newly elected Sheriff Mark Pazin; who described Blake as an excellent undersheriff, a great friend, and ``a tough, no-nonsense guy: never afraid to mix it up with anybody or to tell anybody what he thought . . . we could disagree on things and he was never shy about letting me know his thoughts; but in the end, he never, ever held a grudge''. Current Merced County Sheriff Verne Warnke, who met Blake in the 1970s, echoed that sentiment: ``He taught me that you could take care of business and move on without any grudge whatsoever''. Warnke credits Blake, and his manner of dealing with people, as a strong influence on him. Former Sheriff Tom Cavallero's first supervisor in the Merced County Sheriff's department was Bill Blake, whom he described as being ``without a doubt the single most influential person I've known in my whole career''. Blake retired from law enforcement in 2009 after winning election to the Merced City Council, where he served two terms. Blake is survived by numerous grandchildren and his three children Billy, Tiffany, and Kevin; who followed in his father's footsteps as a sergeant in the Sheriff's Office and current Merced City Councilmember. Bill will be remembered for his accomplishments as a family man and a public servant who leaves behind a proud legacy of fighting for public safety and social justice. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me on this day in a moment of silence in memory of the life and service of Bill Blake. The contributions that he gave throughout his life have, and will continue to have, a lasting impression on the fabric of Merced. He will be missed by many, more than he'll ever know. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E186] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF MR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bill Blake, who passed away January 10, 2016 surrounded by his friends and loved ones. He was 65. Bill was born and raised in Merced. As a young man he worked on farms until joining the Merced Sheriff's Office in 1971 at the age of 21. Bill served eight sheriffs over a 38 year period, working all across Merced County including Los Banos and the surrounding West Side. In 2003 Bill was named undersheriff by newly elected Sheriff Mark Pazin; who described Blake as an excellent undersheriff, a great friend, and ``a tough, no-nonsense guy: never afraid to mix it up with anybody or to tell anybody what he thought . . . we could disagree on things and he was never shy about letting me know his thoughts; but in the end, he never, ever held a grudge''. Current Merced County Sheriff Verne Warnke, who met Blake in the 1970s, echoed that sentiment: ``He taught me that you could take care of business and move on without any grudge whatsoever''.

Ten years ago, Pastor Kenny Grant and five others started a support group for all walks of life to study God's word and help each other grow as Christians. Today, Band of Brothers has over two hundred in attendance each Friday morning at the Garden City First Baptist Church as well as six hundred and fifty individuals receiving weekly videos, in case they miss a meeting. Meetings every Friday morning have become a safe place for many to discuss issues in their life and to study more about the Bible and themselves in front of men who have become, for many, a second family. Since its beginning, I have had the privilege to be a regular member of the Band of Brothers Bible Study, enjoying others' company, listening to inspirational music, and through the Bible, growing a Christian community with men that I now call my friends. I want to congratulate Band of Brothers on their achievements and wish them continued success in the Garden City and Savannah Communities.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate and honor Jahnavi Murthy of South Riding, a young student from my district who has achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in her community. The 2016 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the most impressive student volunteers in each state and the District of Columbia, has named Ms. Murthy as one of their top honorees in Virginia. Ms. Murthy has earned recognition for her input in co-funding an organization with her brother called, ``Feed Hungry People.'' After her work to begin this organization, ``Feed Hungry People'' has been able to raise $24,000. Each month, this organization sends nonperishable meal packs to impoverished areas including Zambia, Panama, Haiti and the Philippines. It is vital that we encourage the kind of selfless contribution this young citizen has made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individuals, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Ms. Murthy are inspiring examples to all of us. The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards was created by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers the importance of their contributions and to inspire other young people to follow their example. I heartily applaud Ms. Murthy for her initiative in seeking to make our community a better place to live, and for the positive impact she has had on the lives of others. Her actions show that young Americans can--and do--play important roles in our communities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E187] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JAHNAVI MURTHY OF SOUTH RIDING ______ HON.

Elaine served as Springfield District Supervisor for 24 years and championed the construction of the world class McConnell Public Safety Transportation and Operations Center. She was a staunch advocate of transportation initiatives and went on to serve as the Chair of the Northern Virginia Transportation Board. Many know her as the ``mother'' of the Virginia Railway Express because of her leadership as a founding board member. VRE serves an average of 20,000 riders per day and may not exist without Elaine's lifelong dedication to transportation infrastructure in the region. Most recently, Elaine served on the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board as an appointee of Governor McDonnell. Beyond her involvement in transportation initiatives, Elaine was the founder and CEO of Accotink Academy, an education center which serves children with learning disabilities throughout the region. She gained national acclaim for her study and work of handwriting and math disorders. The school has grown to 400 students and also opened a second location in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Outside of her volunteer work, she was an avid piano player and cook. Elaine will be greatly missed by her husband, Mac, and their three children, Susan, Mark, and Matthew, nine grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

DAVE HENDERSON ______ HON. JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dave Henderson who passed away December 27, 2015, at the age of 57. Dave was born in Merced, California, on July 21, 1958. He attended Dos Palos High School and is the school's most celebrated athlete. During his high schools years, he was a star baseball and football player. Dave led the Dos Palos High Broncos varsity football team to two Central Valley championships. He had great success as a football player, but Dave decided to progress as a baseball player and accepted a scholarship to play baseball at California State University, Fresno. In 1977, Dave was drafted number one overall by the Seattle Mariners, and his big league career began in 1981 as a center fielder for the Mariners. Dave played for the Mariners for six seasons. Baseball fans will best remember Dave for his two strike, two out, ninth inning, game-tying home run as a member of the Boston Red Sox. Thanks to his heroics, the Red Sox won Game five in extra innings and completed a comeback from a three to one American League Championship Series deficit to win the pennant, earning a trip to the 1986 World Series. Dave found his stride as a member of the Oakland Athletics where he played in three consecutive World Series and was a member of the 1989 World Series Champion team. He had career high statistics and was selected to be on the 1991 All-Star team. In 1994, Dave ended his career as a baseball player after playing 14 seasons with five teams, including the Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics and Kansas City Royals. After retiring as player, Dave worked as a color analyst for the Seattle Mariners' broadcasts. Dave was active in several philanthropic endeavors and believed that giving back was important. He raised money to support research [[Page E189]] for Angelman Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Additionally, he was also one of the founders of Rick's Toys for Kids, a charity which provides dozens of agencies with toys so that thousands of children could receive Christmas gifts who would otherwise go without receiving one. Beginning in high school and into his career in the major leagues, Dave was known by his teammates and coaches for his ever-present smile and positive demeanor. As his former coach Mike Sparks said, ``I will always remember that big smile . . . He treated everyone like they were a friend.'' Dave is survived by his sisters Jeannie, Terry, Patricia, and Michelle, brother Al, first wife Loni, wife Nancy, and his two sons Chase and Trent, and Trent's wife Dani. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life of a great man, Dave Henderson. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E188-E189] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF MR.

VULLO,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E190] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF MARIA T. VULLO ______ HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Maria T. Vullo, who is being honored by Eleanor's Legacy as part of its New York Women Making a Difference ceremony. Maria Vullo is an accomplished litigator who is passionate about women's rights. She oversaw research which has been instrumental in documenting the many reasons why the Equal Rights Amendment is still necessary. On January 21, 2016, in recognition of her extraordinary breadth of experience in financial litigation, Governor Cuomo nominated Ms. Vullo to be Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, a position she will assume on February 23rd. Ms. Vullo is an experienced senior litigator and manager, who has more than 25 years of trial and appellate experience in a broad range of business litigation and investigations in state and federal courts across the country. Ms. Vullo's private practice has included matters involving fraud, real estate, health care, insurance, tax, consumer protection, bankruptcy, antitrust, constitutional and environmental law. Since 2010 she has been of counsel at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, where she had been a partner for 20 years before a brief stint in the Attorney General's office. In 2010, Ms. Vullo oversaw the Economic Justice Division in the Office of the New York State Attorney General, with a staff of approximately 200. She was responsible for numerous investor protection, antitrust and consumer fraud matters, including Martin Act investigations and settlements, investigations and litigations regarding insurance company practices, allegations of price fixing, bid rigging and other antitrust violations, deceptive consumer marketing practices, and violations relating to cooperative and condominium offerings. Ms. Vullo has always spent a considerable amount of her time on pro bono matters. She is a recognized leader in protecting women's rights. She represented women raped by soldiers during the 1992-1995 Bosnian War--a case in which she secured a $745 million jury verdict for the plaintiffs. She also represented abortion providers whose lives had been threatened via an online ``hit list,'' securing a $100 million jury verdict for the plaintiffs. I came to know Ms. Vullo when she became involved in providing research to explain why we continue to need an Equal Rights Amendment. Her brilliance, dedication and determination were evident as she provided invaluable information on the broad range of ways in which women continue to face discrimination, including pregnancy-related discrimination, violence against women, pay inequity and other areas. I am hopeful that Ms. Vullo's research will lead to the passage of an amendment that will finally ensure that women's equality is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Ms. Vullo is a member of the Boards of Directors of the National Organization of Italian-American Women, the Women's Equality Coalition and the ERA Coalition, Inc.; and is a member of the New York Women's Bar Association and the Women Trial Lawyers Caucus. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Maria T. Vullo, a New York woman who makes an extraordinary difference. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E190] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF MARIA T.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of my good friend Dan Nelson, who is retiring after 24 years as the original Executive Director of the San Luis & Delta Mendota Water Authority. Since its inception the Water Authority has been well-served by Dan's brilliance, positive outlook, enormous knowledge and engaging personality. Dan was educated at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire and Fresno State after having grown up in Los Banos, California. Dan brought the experience to the fledgling Water Authority that he gained as General Manager of the San Luis Water District (1987-1991) and the Broadview Water District (1979-1987), as well as experience in the Operations Division of the San Luis Canal Company (1977-1979). As Executive Director Dan promoted respect, integrity, fairness, creativity, drive and a deep appreciation of family among those that he worked with. To address the complex issues before the Water Authority Dan had the vision to create a three-legged strategy for both short and long-term issues: administrative engagement, regulatory/legislative engagement, and litigation. This approach fostered a framework for thoughtful decision-making during challenging times. Dan served the water community outside of his responsibilities with the Water Authority by participating in numerous water-related organizations such as the Land Preservation Association, California Irrigation Institute, Association of California Water Associations, California Water Education Foundation and many other boards, committees, and stakeholder groups.

MATT CARTWRIGHT of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Thomas Tigue, who passed away Monday, February 1, 2016. As a war veteran, school board member, state representative, father, and grandfather, Tom's life was one dedicated to helping others. Tom will be honored posthumously by the Pittston Sunday Dispatch, receiving the paper's Joseph Saporito Sr. Lifetime of Service Award. Born and raised in Hughestown, Thomas was a graduate of St. John the Evangelist High School in Pittston in 1964. He received his degree in Government from King's College in Wilkes-Barre while also serving as a reservist in the Marine Corps. Following graduation, Tom married and deployed to Vietnam. While serving as an Infantry Platoon Commander, Thomas earned a Silver Star for gallantry in combat. He remained with the Marine Corps Reserve for 27 years before returning to work as a counselor at Hickory Run State Park in White Haven and as a computer program analyst for Metropolitan Life Insurance, both while taking business classes at King's College. From 1977-1979, Tigue served on the Pittston Area School Board. In 1980, Tom was elected as a Representative for the 118th Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving the residents of Luzerne, Lackawanna, and Monroe counties. He remained in the State House for 26 years, retiring in 2006. During his tenure, Thomas served as the Democratic Chair of the House Veterans Affairs and Emergency Preparedness Committee, where he helped establish the Military Family Relief Assistance Program which provides assistance to eligible Pennsylvania service members and their family members financially impacted by military service. After his service in the legislature, Thomas worked as Managing Director of the Delaware River Maritime Enterprise Council until his retirement in 2010. It is an honor to recognize an individual who led a truly outstanding life. I am grateful for all of the work Thomas did for his community and for the people of Pennsylvania. His passing, [[Page E192]] only six months after his wife Dianne's passing, is deeply saddening, and he will be greatly missed by the many people he helped. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E191-E192] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORIAL RECOGNITION OF THOMAS TIGUE FOR A LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA ______ HON.

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgE192-2,CREC-2016-02-23,114,INTRODUCTION OF THE REDUCING LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E192] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE REDUCING LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT ACT ______ HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Reducing Long-Term Unemployment Act, to address one of the lingering workforce tragedies in today's economy--our long-term unemployed--and to keep the economy growing. Although the overall unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent, Americans who have remained unemployed for longer than 27 weeks have not enjoyed a similar recovery. In January 2016, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was 2.1 million, which accounted for 26.9 percent of the total unemployed population. To make matters even worse, the long-term unemployed now face employment discrimination as employers show reluctance to hire job- seekers because of the length of their unemployment. Therefore, my bill provides a necessary incentive to hire the long-term unemployed--a $5,000 tax credit for employers against their payroll tax liability for each (net) new long-term unemployed person they hire. The tax credit is large enough to give employers an incentive to increase the hiring and wages of those who have been unjustifiably left behind, while ensuring that the economy benefits from their participation. The credit would be available to the broadest base of employers because every employer-- government, non-profit, and for-profit--pays payroll taxes, and employers could claim the credit on a quarterly rather than annual basis. According to the independent, non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the proposal would ``increase both output and employment,'' through four mechanisms: (1) with lower employment costs, employers would reduce the costs of their products and services, which, in turn, would first boost sales and then hiring and hours worked; (2) employers would pass on some of the tax savings to employees in the form of higher wages or other compensation, which, in turn, would increase employees' purchasing power; (3) higher profits would lead to higher stock prices for public companies, increasing shareholders' wealth and therefore their willingness to spend; and (4) with lower employment costs, employers would increase hiring. The bill has safeguards to prevent employers from gaming the system, including denying a credit to an employer that fires one employee and hires a replacement in order to take advantage of the incentive. For some time, it has been clear that targeted policies are necessary to address today's stubborn long-term unemployment rates. Without significant targeting, the long-term unemployed are in danger of becoming permanently unemployed. This group of competent and experienced Americans deserves better. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E192] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE REDUCING LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT ACT ______ HON.

According to the independent, non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the proposal would ``increase both output and employment,'' through four mechanisms: (1) with lower employment costs, employers would reduce the costs of their products and services, which, in turn, would first boost sales and then hiring and hours worked; (2) employers would pass on some of the tax savings to employees in the form of higher wages or other compensation, which, in turn, would increase employees' purchasing power; (3) higher profits would lead to higher stock prices for public companies, increasing shareholders' wealth and therefore their willingness to spend; and (4) with lower employment costs, employers would increase hiring. The bill has safeguards to prevent employers from gaming the system, including denying a credit to an employer that fires one employee and hires a replacement in order to take advantage of the incentive. For some time, it has been clear that targeted policies are necessary to address today's stubborn long-term unemployment rates. Without significant targeting, the long-term unemployed are in danger of becoming permanently unemployed. This group of competent and experienced Americans deserves better. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,3066,3066,3137,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e192] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] introduction of the reducing long-term unemployment act ______ hon. eleanor holmes norton of the district of columbia in the house of representatives tuesday, february 23, 2016 ms. norton. mr. speaker, today, i introduce the reducing long-term unemployment act, to address one of the lingering workforce tragedies in today's economy--our long-term unemployed--and to keep the economy growing. although the overall unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent, americans who have remained unemployed for longer than 27 weeks have not enjoyed a similar recovery. in january 2016, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was 2.1 million, which accounted for 26.9 percent of the total unemployed population. to make matters even worse, the long-term unemployed now face employment discrimination as employers show reluctance to hire job- seekers because of the length of their unemployment. therefore, my bill provides a necessary incentive to hire the long-term unemployed--a $5,000 tax credit for employers against their payroll tax liability for each (net) new long-term unemployed person they hire. the tax credit is large enough to give employers an incentive to increase the hiring and wages of those who have been unjustifiably left behind, while ensuring that the economy benefits from their participation. the credit would be available to the broadest base of employers because every employer-- government, non-profit, and for-profit--pays payroll taxes, and employers could claim the credit on a quarterly rather than annual basis. according to the independent, non-partisan congressional budget office, the proposal would ``increase both output and employment,'' through four mechanisms: (1) with lower employment costs, employers would reduce the costs of their products and services, which, in turn, would first boost sales and then hiring and hours worked; (2) employers would pass on some of the tax savings to employees in the form of higher wages or other compensation, which, in turn, would increase employees' purchasing power; (3) higher profits would lead to higher stock prices for public companies, increasing shareholders' wealth and therefore their willingness to spend; and (4) with lower employment costs, employers would increase hiring. the bill has safeguards to prevent employers from gaming the system, including denying a credit to an employer that fires one employee and hires a replacement in order to take advantage of the incentive. for some time, it has been clear that targeted policies are necessary to address today's stubborn long-term unemployment rates. without significant targeting, the long-term unemployed are in danger of becoming permanently unemployed. this group of competent and experienced americans deserves better. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________",3066

ROBERT L. MILLER ______ HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a God-fearing and impressionistic man Rev. Robert L. Miller. Rev. Miller has shown what can be done through tenacity, dedication and a desire to serve God. Rev. Miller has done many things throughout his life, but inside he has always been a preacher. At 89 years old, he can't see himself ever hanging it up, because it's his calling. Some of the members of the church have said their church will close its doors if he leaves. He is currently serving five churches on a rotation schedule where he will do two services a Sunday except one Sunday a month, he only does one service. Forty years ago in July is when he first took the pulpit at New Mount Zion M. B. Church. Eleven years later in June 1986, he began serving his fifth church, Locust Grove M. B. Church. He also preached at Providence M. B. Church from 1971 until 1986. He has served as vice moderator of the Sharkey County Baptist Association and is currently the moderator of the Warren County Baptist Association. He was ordained in December 1968 and started serving his first church just weeks later. The profession is so much a part of his soul; oftentimes he slides into preacher mode mid-conversation. The only job Rev. Miller has ever had besides being a preacher was a letter carrier for 25 years. At 18, Miller was drafted and left high school to join World War II. He spent time in France, England, Belgium and Germany as a medic. Once the war was over, he returned to Vicksburg to finish his high school degree at Bowman High School. Rev. Miller married two years later and had eight children with his wife of almost 30 years. She passed away in 1979. He was remarried in August 2013 to Elease Fisher Miller. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Rev. Robert L. Miller for 40 years of service to New Mount Zion M. B. Church. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E192] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING REV.

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgE192-5,CREC-2016-02-23,114,RECOGNIZING THE TOWN OF HAVERSTRAW,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E192-E193] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE TOWN OF HAVERSTRAW ______ HON. NITA M. LOWEY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Town of Haverstraw in Rockland County, New York, as it begins the celebration of its 400th anniversary year. I am honored to represent in the Congress this community with [[Page E193]] its richly diverse population, historic brick homes, beautiful views of the Hudson River, and a growing business district. Haverstraw is a Dutch name which means ``Oat Straw,'' referring to the straw of the river meadows that once filled Haverstraw Bay. Balthazar de Harte, a New York merchant, purchased the tract of land along the river that would become Haverstraw in 1666 from the Lenni Lenape confederation of the Algonquin Indians. The precinct of Haverstraw was created in 1719 when it separated from Orangetown, and officially became a town in 1788. Today, the Town includes the Village of Haverstraw, the Village of West Haverstraw, and part of the Village of Pomona. In 1780, Haverstraw was the scene of a major plot, which if it had succeeded, could have changed the course of the Revolutionary War. American General Benedict Arnold had convinced George Washington to give him command of the fort at West Point, but secretly was involved in treasonable negotiations with English Emissary Major John Andre to sell the plans to West Point to the British. Arnold and Andre met during the night on the beach of Haverstraw, but the negotiations were not completed by dawn. Arnold and Andre fled, and Andre was captured in Tarrytown on his way back to British lines. Haverstraw is located in the widest point of the Hudson River, which was the main artery of trade between New York City and Albany, as well as the dividing line between New England and other colonies. In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, Haverstraw was home to several key industries. It became the greatest center of brick production in the nation, one year shipping out more than 300 million bricks from Haverstraw Bay for the New York City area. The Rockland Print Works incorporated in 1853 to print and dye woolen, cotton and linen goods, and the current owner, Garnerville Holding Company, now rents space to businesses, artists and craftsmen. These buildings are some of the few examples of the 19th century factory architecture still in use in the United States. Haverstraw has a diverse history, rich with culture. Central Presbyterian Church was founded in 1846 and moved to its present location with its beautiful Tiffany windows in 1909. The Congregation of the Sons of Jacob, established in 1877, is the oldest Jewish congregation in Rockland County. In 1905 the New York State Hospital for the Care of Crippled and Deformed Children purchased 48 acres of land in West Haverstraw, known as the Lilburn Estate, opening a facility that became world famous for its rehabilitation and research programs. In 1974, the hospital was renamed the Helen Hayes Hospital to recognize the great contributions of the famous actress to the institution. The Haverstraw King's Daughters Public Library was chartered in 1895 and opened its present building on Main Street in 1903. Today, Haverstraw is a shining example of a diverse community working together to better the Town as a whole. Residents hail from Latin America, Russia, India, and all over the world, giving Haverstraw a global culture all its own. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the Town of Haverstraw on this special anniversary as its residents celebrate its distinguished past and look ahead to a strong future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E192-E193] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE TOWN OF HAVERSTRAW ______ HON.

RICHARD E. NEAL of massachusetts in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act, a bill that would have the U.S. Treasury mint coins in recognition of the Hall of Fame's 60th anniversary. These unique dome-shaped coins that would come at no expense to the taxpayers is the ideal symbol for the first and only museum that honors the sport on all levels around the world. In my hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts in 1891, a young physical education teacher by the name of James Naismith introduced this simple game to his class that he called, ``basket ball.'' Since then, the world of sports has never been the same. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was founded in his honor in 1959, even though all they had was a couple of displays at Springfield College. The Hall of Fame has since grown into one of the most impressive structures on the Springfield skyline, where more than 6 million visitors a year get to see hundreds of thousands of items of memorabilia spanning the past hundred years. More than 300 people have been enshrined at the Hall of Fame since its inception. Some of the great players of all time such as Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, and Wilt Chamberlain, along with some of the legendary coaches like Pat Summit and John Wooden will forever be immortalized for their contribution to this sport. As importantly, the Hall of Fame has always been an advocate for good sportsmanship and promoting respect on and off the court. Mr. Speaker, what began as a simple game in a gym has transformed into a worldwide sensation that attracts millions of spectators every night. It is for this reason that I ask that the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame receive this great recognition and I ask my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E193] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NAISMITH MEMORIAL BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT ______ HON.

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgE194,CREC-2016-02-23,114,90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LOUISIANA MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E194] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LOUISIANA MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION ______ HON. GARRET GRAVES of louisiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise with every member of the Louisiana House delegation to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Louisiana Municipal Association. On January 28, 1926, the first Louisiana Conference of Mayors was held to adopt their Constitution, and elect Mayor F.J. Foisy of Alexandria the first president of the organization. That group would eventually become what is known today as the Louisiana Municipal Association. Since its inception, the LMA has tirelessly served municipalities of our state, thereby improving the quality of life for the citizens of our cities, towns, and villages. Today, the LMA zealously represents the interest of its 305 members, including 127 villages, 112 towns, 64 cities, and 2 parishes. It is my honor to commend this great organization for its non-partisan commitment to legislative advocacy, education, technical assistance, and a myriad of member services that enable municipal governments to run efficiently and effectively. One of the great advantages of the LMA, is that it provides a forum for municipal leaders to meet and assist each other in solving problems common to all municipalities. To help fulfill its three-fold mission of education, advocacy, and service, the LMA has created a variety of initiatives. The LMA holds several events each year; an annual convention, a Mid-Winter Conference, ten district meetings, a Municipal Day during the state's legislative session, and 15 or more annual webinars. 2016 has been deemed the ``Year of Education'' to launch the initiative for enhanced education benefitting municipal entities and their employees. It will be a year-long celebration commencing with the LMA's Mid-Winter Conference in February. The LMA has staff dedicated to state and federal legislative advocacy, an effort that has been successful on both fronts. On the federal level, the LMA played a critical role in the enactment of the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 by joining forces with the National League of Cities and other coastal state municipal leagues to lead the charge in lobbying Congress to enact critical reforms to the Biggert Waters Act of 2012, thereby facilitating affordable homeowner flood insurance in Louisiana and across the country. On the state level, the LMA has been a strong voice for Louisiana municipalities in efforts to fight blight, promote law enforcement, maintain funding, and enhance economic growth. To provide excellent member services, the LMA has formed two wholly- owned subsidiaries: Risk Management, Inc., which manages a self- insurance fund that addresses the insurance and liability needs of members; and the Louisiana Municipal Advisory and Technical Services Bureau, Inc., which provides outstanding and economical operational support programs to its members. In addition, the LMA boasts two political subdivisions: Unemployment Compensation Fund and the Louisiana Municipal Gas Authority. Other notable services, affiliate organizations, and advisory organizations include: the Computer and Internet Technology Assistance Program, which provides municipalities with free computer equipment and internet access to link them to the digital world; the Municipal Employees Retirement System; Louisiana Association of Chiefs of Police; Louisiana Conference of Mayors; Louisiana City Attorneys Association; Louisiana Recreation and Parks Association; Louisiana Municipal Clerks Association; Louisiana Association of Tax Administrators, Louisiana Fire Chiefs Association, Louisiana Airport Managers and Associates, Louisiana Municipal Black Caucus Association, Louisiana Rural Water Association, Louisiana Association of Municipal Secretaries and Assistants, and the Building Officials Association of Louisiana. The Louisiana Municipal Association's Executive Board is currently under the direction of President Mayor Carroll Breaux of Springhill. President Breaux's Executive Committee is composed of First Vice President Mayor Barney Arceneaux of Gonzales; Second Vice President Mayor Lawrence Henagan of DeQuincy; Immediate Past President Mayor David Camardelle of Grand Isle; and District A Vice President Mayor Jimmy Williams of Sibley. The Executive Director is Ronnie Harris, former mayor of Gretna for 28 years. From its humble beginnings consisting of only 29 forward-thinking mayors seeking to empower their communities, the LMA has evolved into an exemplary organization earning the esteem and trust of local, state, and federal elected officials. The LMA exemplifies the enthusiastic cooperation that is necessary to achieve a better and brighter Louisiana. For 90 years, they have advanced with technology, all while maintaining the core values that drive their success. Let's all send our warmest congratulations to the Louisiana Municipal Association for 90 years of excellence in the State of Louisiana. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E194] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LOUISIANA MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise with every member of the Louisiana House delegation to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Louisiana Municipal Association. On January 28, 1926, the first Louisiana Conference of Mayors was held to adopt their Constitution, and elect Mayor F.J. Foisy of Alexandria the first president of the organization. That group would eventually become what is known today as the Louisiana Municipal Association. Since its inception, the LMA has tirelessly served municipalities of our state, thereby improving the quality of life for the citizens of our cities, towns, and villages. Today, the LMA zealously represents the interest of its 305 members, including 127 villages, 112 towns, 64 cities, and 2 parishes. It is my honor to commend this great organization for its non-partisan commitment to legislative advocacy, education, technical assistance, and a myriad of member services that enable municipal governments to run efficiently and effectively. One of the great advantages of the LMA, is that it provides a forum for municipal leaders to meet and assist each other in solving problems common to all municipalities. To help fulfill its three-fold mission of education, advocacy, and service, the LMA has created a variety of initiatives. The LMA holds several events each year; an annual convention, a Mid-Winter Conference, ten district meetings, a Municipal Day during the state's legislative session, and 15 or more annual webinars. 2016 has been deemed the ``Year of Education'' to launch the initiative for enhanced education benefitting municipal entities and their employees. It will be a year-long celebration commencing with the LMA's Mid-Winter Conference in February. The LMA has staff dedicated to state and federal legislative advocacy, an effort that has been successful on both fronts. On the federal level, the LMA played a critical role in the enactment of the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 by joining forces with the National League of Cities and other coastal state municipal leagues to lead the charge in lobbying Congress to enact critical reforms to the Biggert Waters Act of 2012, thereby facilitating affordable homeowner flood insurance in Louisiana and across the country. On the state level, the LMA has been a strong voice for Louisiana municipalities in efforts to fight blight, promote law enforcement, maintain funding, and enhance economic growth. To provide excellent member services, the LMA has formed two wholly- owned subsidiaries: Risk Management, Inc., which manages a self- insurance fund that addresses the insurance and liability needs of members; and the Louisiana Municipal Advisory and Technical Services Bureau, Inc., which provides outstanding and economical operational support programs to its members. In addition, the LMA boasts two political subdivisions: Unemployment Compensation Fund and the Louisiana Municipal Gas Authority. Other notable services, affiliate organizations, and advisory organizations include: the Computer and Internet Technology Assistance Program, which provides municipalities with free computer equipment and internet access to link them to the digital world; the Municipal Employees Retirement System; Louisiana Association of Chiefs of Police; Louisiana Conference of Mayors; Louisiana City Attorneys Association; Louisiana Recreation and Parks Association; Louisiana Municipal Clerks Association; Louisiana Association of Tax Administrators, Louisiana Fire Chiefs Association, Louisiana Airport Managers and Associates, Louisiana Municipal Black Caucus Association, Louisiana Rural Water Association, Louisiana Association of Municipal Secretaries and Assistants, and the Building Officials Association of Louisiana. The Louisiana Municipal Association's Executive Board is currently under the direction of President Mayor Carroll Breaux of Springhill. President Breaux's Executive Committee is composed of First Vice President Mayor Barney Arceneaux of Gonzales; Second Vice President Mayor Lawrence Henagan of DeQuincy; Immediate Past President Mayor David Camardelle of Grand Isle; and District A Vice President Mayor Jimmy Williams of Sibley. The Executive Director is Ronnie Harris, former mayor of Gretna for 28 years. From its humble beginnings consisting of only 29 forward-thinking mayors seeking to empower their communities, the LMA has evolved into an exemplary organization earning the esteem and trust of local, state, and federal elected officials. The LMA exemplifies the enthusiastic cooperation that is necessary to achieve a better and brighter Louisiana. For 90 years, they have advanced with technology, all while maintaining the core values that drive their success. Let's all send our warmest congratulations to the Louisiana Municipal Association for 90 years of excellence in the State of Louisiana. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,5285,5285,5356,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e194] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] 90th anniversary of the louisiana municipal association ______ hon. garret graves of louisiana in the house of representatives tuesday, february 23, 2016 mr. graves of louisiana. mr. speaker, it is with great pleasure that i rise with every member of the louisiana house delegation to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the louisiana municipal association. on january 28, 1926, the first louisiana conference of mayors was held to adopt their constitution, and elect mayor f.j. foisy of alexandria the first president of the organization. that group would eventually become what is known today as the louisiana municipal association. since its inception, the lma has tirelessly served municipalities of our state, thereby improving the quality of life for the citizens of our cities, towns, and villages. today, the lma zealously represents the interest of its 305 members, including 127 villages, 112 towns, 64 cities, and 2 parishes. it is my honor to commend this great organization for its non-partisan commitment to legislative advocacy, education, technical assistance, and a myriad of member services that enable municipal governments to run efficiently and effectively. one of the great advantages of the lma, is that it provides a forum for municipal leaders to meet and assist each other in solving problems common to all municipalities. to help fulfill its three-fold mission of education, advocacy, and service, the lma has created a variety of initiatives. the lma holds several events each year;

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Dr. Alex Moir, who passed away on December 19, 2015, at the age of 53. Dr. Moir was an extraordinary individual and he will always be remembered as someone who lived his life with purpose and great dedication to his family, patients, and community. Dr. Moir attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he received a bachelor's degree, prior to attending the University of Miami, where he received his medical degree. Upon graduating from the University of Miami, Dr. Moir completed his residency in Family and Community Medicine at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Fresno and joined the faculty after graduating. Among his many contributions to the Valley, Dr. Moir focused his work on rural and small communities, the education of resident medical students, midlevel providers in the practice of full scope family medicine, and Latino and medically underserved health care. Dr. Moir also taught and practiced rural medicine in the Selma area for twenty years, serving as the Director for Selma Pathway from 1995 until he took on the role of Chief at UCSF Fresno. Furthermore, he was active on the medical staff of Selma Hospital (now Adventist Medical Center, Selma), previously serving as Chief of Staff and Chief of Medicine. Throughout his career, Dr. Moir received many teaching awards and was recognized by the Adventist/Central Valley Network with the Physician of the Year Mission award. He received this award for his commitment in providing physical, mental, and spiritual care to his patients, something for which he was well known. As an advocate of health awareness, Dr. Moir frequently spoke to high school and college students about healthcare and medically underserved communities. Furthermore, he was also a member of the American Academy of Family Medicine, the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, the American Medical Association, the Children's Medical Associates and the Fresno- Madera Medical Society. Dr. Moir's contributions to the people he touched will be his legacy. He clearly was a patient's doctor and was viewed as an excellent teacher and well-respected practitioner of medicine by all his peers. While he administered to his patients, he also found joy in teaching his students. More important, while he could have taught and practiced medicine in many places, he chose to be where he was most needed, in our Valley. He is survived by his wife Elise Hallowell Moir and their sons Taylor and Alden Moir. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life of Dr. Moir. Dr. Moir touched and aided so many throughout his much too short life. His loving nature and genuine character will be greatly missed by all who knew him. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E194] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF DR.

Ms. Hallman is a 10 year teaching veteran and has been teaching math and science to 5th graders at West Chatham Elementary School for 3 years. Ms. Hallman says she was inspired to be a great teacher after her grandmother and co-teacher died within two days of each other last year. Ms. Hallman's inspiration is certainly noticeable in her enthusiastic commitment to motivate as well as educate using funny accents and dressing up in costumes while teaching classes. She explores almost any avenue to help her students learn. On February 11th, Ms. Hallman was recognized at the Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools Teacher of the Year Gala at the Savannah International Trade Center during which she was presented the Teacher of the Year Award. Competition for the award is fierce since the award is presented a year in advance due to the time consuming and rigorous selection process. Fifty-five of the top teachers from the Savannah-Chatham County area wrote essays, were observed in the classroom, and were personally interviewed by community leaders and former Teachers of the Year. Ms. Hallman was also presented with a flag of Liberty and Learning which will be flown above her school, given the opportunity to lead the Professional Senate, and will now compete for the Georgia State Teacher of the Year Award.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Amanda Hallman of West Chatham Elementary School in Pooler, Georgia, for winning the 2017 Savannah-Chatham County Teacher of the Year Award. Ms. Hallman is a 10 year teaching veteran and has been teaching math and science to 5th graders at West Chatham Elementary School for 3 years. Ms. Hallman says she was inspired to be a great teacher after her grandmother and co-teacher died within two days of each other last year. Ms. Hallman's inspiration is certainly noticeable in her enthusiastic commitment to motivate as well as educate using funny accents and dressing up in costumes while teaching classes. She explores almost any avenue to help her students learn. On February 11th, Ms. Hallman was recognized at the Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools Teacher of the Year Gala at the Savannah International Trade Center during which she was presented the Teacher of the Year Award. Competition for the award is fierce since the award is presented a year in advance due to the time consuming and rigorous selection process. Fifty-five of the top teachers from the Savannah-Chatham County area wrote essays, were observed in the classroom, and were personally interviewed by community leaders and former Teachers of the Year. Ms. Hallman was also presented with a flag of Liberty and Learning which will be flown above her school, given the opportunity to lead the Professional Senate, and will now compete for the Georgia State Teacher of the Year Award.

JACOB CHAPMAN BELIN, JR. ______ HON. JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I, along with Representative McCarthy and Representative Valadao, rise today to congratulate Mr. Jacob Chapman Belin, Jr. on his well-deserved retirement as President of Kern Oil & Refining Co. He deserves to be commended for his tireless work within the petroleum industry and for his outstanding work with Kern Oil for the past forty-four years. Mr. Belin was born in Port St. Joe, Florida on March 31, 1948 to Jacob Chapman Belin, Sr. and Myrle Fillingim Belin. As a young student, Mr. Belin was actively engaged in his studies and was well-known for his passion for basketball. He attended Port St. Joe High School where he was recognized as Florida's second-leading scorer in basketball, served as President of his senior class, and graduated as valedictorian in 1966. Upon graduation from high school, Mr. Belin attended North Carolina State University (NCSU) where he graduated in 1970 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics, with a dual minor in Engineering Mechanics and Economics. While at NCSU, Mr. Belin was also a member of Phi Kappa Phi, one of the nation's oldest multidisciplinary collegiate honor societies. Mr. Belin went on to attend Georgia Institute of Technology from 1970-1972 in pursuit of a Master's Degree in Industrial Management. During the summer of 1972, Mr. Belin began to work at Charter Oil Company in Jacksonville, Florida. While at Charter Oil Company, Mr. Belin had the opportunity to work with different Charter Oil Company subsidiaries, which included Kern County Refinery (now known as Kern Oil and Refining Co.). The work that Mr. Belin did with Kern County Refinery led him to accept a job offer at the Kern County Refinery office in Cerritos, California in April of 1974. Mr. Belin worked in the Refinery's crude oil and products supply marketing department until 1977. While pursuing his career in the petroleum industry, Mr. Belin married the love of his life Betty Grace Phillips on June 29, 1974. Together they had one son, Phillip Andrew Belin who was born on October 5, 1977. Mr. and Mrs. Belin always ensured that Phillip was involved in sports and recreational activities. Furthermore, Mr. Belin was very active in young Phillip's Little League baseball program, was a manager of several of Phillip's youth baseball teams, and coached his youth basketball team for several years alongside his good friends, Tom Jensen and Ed Lassiter. Phillip married Marie Milligan and has blessed Mr. Belin and Betty with four grandchildren, Simon, James, Whitney and Serena. In addition to being a family man, Mr. Belin is a man of faith and has been heavily involved in faith-based activities within the communities he lived in over the past years. These activities include serving as an adult Sunday school teacher at Champion Forest Baptist Church and being a member of Rolling Hills Covenant Church as well as Peninsula Community Church. By mid-1977, Mr. Belin had opened a crude oil, products and LPG trading office for Kern County Refinery in Houston, Texas. He served in the Houston office until 1984 and was then relocated back to Long Beach, California to what was known as Kern Oil and Refining Co. It was in Long Beach, in 1985 that Mr. Belin was promoted and became President of Kern Oil and Refining Co. Mr. Belin received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at NCSU in 1993. Furthermore, Mr. Belin was a huge factor in the growth of Kern, transitioning the company from a 10,000 barrel per day plant to the safe, competitive, and compliant, 27,000 barrel-per-day small and independent California refinery that it is today. Over the past forty-four years, Mr. Belin has been a great leader and extremely dedicated to Kern, which has ultimately brought the company to success. In Mr. Belin's words, ``I gave everything I could to Kern; as one might say in the game of basketball, I left it all on the court! My career goals were simple: work hard; ask others their opinion/ thoughts; listen to them; be decisive; show others the respect they deserve; and defend Kern.'' Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that we ask our colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in paying tribute to the career of Mr. Jacob Chapman Belin, Jr. We thank him for his service and lasting contributions to California's petroleum industry.

Mr. Speaker, I, along with Representative McCarthy and Representative Valadao, rise today to congratulate Mr. Jacob Chapman Belin, Jr. on his well-deserved retirement as President of Kern Oil & Refining Co. He deserves to be commended for his tireless work within the petroleum industry and for his outstanding work with Kern Oil for the past forty-four years. Mr. Belin was born in Port St. Joe, Florida on March 31, 1948 to Jacob Chapman Belin, Sr. and Myrle Fillingim Belin. As a young student, Mr. Belin was actively engaged in his studies and was well-known for his passion for basketball. He attended Port St. Joe High School where he was recognized as Florida's second-leading scorer in basketball, served as President of his senior class, and graduated as valedictorian in 1966. Upon graduation from high school, Mr. Belin attended North Carolina State University (NCSU) where he graduated in 1970 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics, with a dual minor in Engineering Mechanics and Economics. While at NCSU, Mr. Belin was also a member of Phi Kappa Phi, one of the nation's oldest multidisciplinary collegiate honor societies. Mr. Belin went on to attend Georgia Institute of Technology from 1970-1972 in pursuit of a Master's Degree in Industrial Management. During the summer of 1972, Mr. Belin began to work at Charter Oil Company in Jacksonville, Florida. While at Charter Oil Company, Mr. Belin had the opportunity to work with different Charter Oil Company subsidiaries, which included Kern County Refinery (now known as Kern Oil and Refining Co.). The work that Mr. Belin did with Kern County Refinery led him to accept a job offer at the Kern County Refinery office in Cerritos, California in April of 1974. Mr. Belin worked in the Refinery's crude oil and products supply marketing department until 1977. While pursuing his career in the petroleum industry, Mr. Belin married the love of his life Betty Grace Phillips on June 29, 1974. Together they had one son, Phillip Andrew Belin who was born on October 5, 1977. Mr. and Mrs. Belin always ensured that Phillip was involved in sports and recreational activities. Furthermore, Mr. Belin was very active in young Phillip's Little League baseball program, was a manager of several of Phillip's youth baseball teams, and coached his youth basketball team for several years alongside his good friends, Tom Jensen and Ed Lassiter. Phillip married Marie Milligan and has blessed Mr. Belin and Betty with four grandchildren, Simon, James, Whitney and Serena. In addition to being a family man, Mr. Belin is a man of faith and has been heavily involved in faith-based activities within the communities he lived in over the past years. These activities include serving as an adult Sunday school teacher at Champion Forest Baptist Church and being a member of Rolling Hills Covenant Church as well as Peninsula Community Church. By mid-1977, Mr. Belin had opened a crude oil, products and LPG trading office for Kern County Refinery in Houston, Texas. He served in the Houston office until 1984 and was then relocated back to Long Beach, California to what was known as Kern Oil and Refining Co. It was in Long Beach, in 1985 that Mr. Belin was promoted and became President of Kern Oil and Refining Co. Mr. Belin received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at NCSU in 1993. Furthermore, Mr. Belin was a huge factor in the growth of Kern, transitioning the company from a 10,000 barrel per day plant to the safe, competitive, and compliant, 27,000 barrel-per-day small and independent California refinery that it is today. Over the past forty-four years, Mr. Belin has been a great leader and extremely dedicated to Kern, which has ultimately brought the company to success. In Mr. Belin's words, ``I gave everything I could to Kern; as one might say in the game of basketball, I left it all on the court! My career goals were simple: work hard; ask others their opinion/ thoughts; listen to them; be decisive; show others the respect they deserve; and defend Kern.'' Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that we ask our colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in paying tribute to the career of Mr. Jacob Chapman Belin, Jr. We thank him for his service and lasting contributions to California's petroleum industry.

BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable veteran, Mr. Edison Thomas Brown, Jr. U.S. Army Veteran Edison Thomas Brown, Jr. is a Mississippi native who was born and reared in the hills of Holmes County within the U.S. Second Congressional District. Born in the very late 1950's, Mr. Brown, and other youth like him, grew up during the heat of oppression, segregation and poverty of the Holmes County 1960s civil rights movement. Yet, Mr. Brown says, he nor his family ever viewed themselves as underclass. Although poor by economic standards and conditions, he and his siblings learned early of the importance of working hard to make a decent living by two nurturing parents, who were farmers themselves and who also worked for white farmers as well, picking cotton and such. His parents were Edison Thomas Brown, Sr. and Ednora Randle Brown (both now deceased). His father was also a U.S. Army veteran who served in World War II. In fact, Mr. Brown says he was inspired to volunteer to serve his country in the military by his father and eldest brother James, a U.S. Army Vietnam veteran. After graduating from high school at what is formerly known as Tchula Attendance Center (TAC) in Tchula, MS, he began his military career in July, 1975 at Fort Knox, Ky. During his tour of duty, he was trained and served as a Track Vehicle Mechanic, specializing in diesel repairs. His U.S. military career also included service in Gelnhausen, Germany. While in the military, he earned the rank of Specialist 4th Class (SPEC 4). Proud to serve his country, Mr. Brown is grateful that his military career afforded him many travels that he would not have afforded to make and opportunities he possibly would not have had. Mr. Brown's tour of duly concluded at Fort Stewart, GA in 1979; however, he remained in reserve status until 1981, when he received an Honorable Discharge. After the military, Mr. Brown took advantage of the GI Bill and began to educate himself (part-time) in Electronic Service Technology coursework. Over the years, he has served in several employment capacities in the Metro Jackson area. His longest stint was with McRaes Distribution and its merging operations, 1985-2001. Today, a Clinton, Miss, resident in the Second Congressional District, Mr. Brown spends most of his time actively serving in Holy Temple Baptist Church of West Jackson, pastored by the history-making Rev. Audrey Lynne Hall. At Holy Temple as a deacon, he is Chairman and also serves as Sunday School Superintendent and teacher. He, his wife, Gail, and son, Edison, III, have also participated in the church's ongoing Homeless Outreach Ministry in which the church gives toiletries, snacks and other needful items to the homeless once a month at Poindexter Park near Downtown Jackson. Mr. Brown's favorite scripture of the Bible in which he tries to live by is Proverbs 3:5-6--``Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.'' Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing a special Veteran, Mr. Edison Thomas Brown, Jr., for his dedication and support to the Holmes County Community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E197] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING VETERAN EDISON THOMAS BROWN, JR. ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I, along with my colleague Congressman Mike Thompson, rise to recognize the life and service of Augustine ``Gus'' Ortiz Vegas, who served honorably for fifteen years with the Richmond Police Department in Contra Costa County. A lifelong Bay Area resident, Mr. Vegas was born on August 8, 1957, in San Francisco and moved to nearby Vallejo as a young child. He was a member of the 1976 graduating class of St. Patrick's High School in Vallejo, where he excelled at track, football, and wrestling. Those who knew Mr. Vegas admired him for his generosity and his empathy. Together with his wife Sandra, he ran a non-profit called Fostering Greatness that offered mentoring, clothing, and other resources to children in the local foster care system. In his professional career, Mr. Vegas always focused on keeping others safe. His first job was as Operator at the Equilon refinery in Martinez, California, where he was also a rescue team member and auxiliary firefighter. In 1990, he graduated as the Valedictorian of the Napa Valley College Police Academy, and in 2001, began his career with the Richmond Police Department. Officer Vegas applied his tremendous ability to connect with others to his work where he fully embodied the ideals of community policing. He went beyond simply deterring crime and arresting suspects to having genuine empathy and a connection to the community he served. Officer Vegas's aptitude was recognized within the department and he became a property crimes detective rising through the department to become a homicide detective. In these roles, he was not only adept at solving crimes, but shined in his ability to provide empathy and closure for victims' families. Officer Vegas was versatile in his professional abilities due to his gift to connect with others. In his last assignment, he worked closely with agencies like the Richmond City Attorney's Office and the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) to enforce the City of Richmond's Municipal Codes. Officer Vegas cared deeply about his family and considered them the most important part of his life. Congressman Thompson and I send our deepest condolences to Officer Vegas' family, including Sandra, his wife of 32 years, their five sons, five daughters, and 22 grandchildren.

Together with his wife Sandra, he ran a non-profit called Fostering Greatness that offered mentoring, clothing, and other resources to children in the local foster care system. In his professional career, Mr. Vegas always focused on keeping others safe. His first job was as Operator at the Equilon refinery in Martinez, California, where he was also a rescue team member and auxiliary firefighter. In 1990, he graduated as the Valedictorian of the Napa Valley College Police Academy, and in 2001, began his career with the Richmond Police Department. Officer Vegas applied his tremendous ability to connect with others to his work where he fully embodied the ideals of community policing. He went beyond simply deterring crime and arresting suspects to having genuine empathy and a connection to the community he served. Officer Vegas's aptitude was recognized within the department and he became a property crimes detective rising through the department to become a homicide detective. In these roles, he was not only adept at solving crimes, but shined in his ability to provide empathy and closure for victims' families. Officer Vegas was versatile in his professional abilities due to his gift to connect with others. In his last assignment, he worked closely with agencies like the Richmond City Attorney's Office and the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) to enforce the City of Richmond's Municipal Codes. Officer Vegas cared deeply about his family and considered them the most important part of his life. Congressman Thompson and I send our deepest condolences to Officer Vegas' family, including Sandra, his wife of 32 years, their five sons, five daughters, and 22 grandchildren. Officer Vegas made a lasting impression on our community, and he will be greatly missed. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,2766,2766,2837,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e197] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing the life and service of augustine ``gus'' ortiz vegas ______ hon. mark desaulnier of california in the house of representatives tuesday, february 23, 2016 mr. desaulnier. mr. speaker, i, along with my colleague congressman mike thompson, rise to recognize the life and service of augustine ``gus'' ortiz vegas, who served honorably for fifteen years with the richmond police department in contra costa county. a lifelong bay area resident, mr. vegas was born on august 8, 1957, in san francisco and moved to nearby vallejo as a young child. he was a member of the 1976 graduating class of st. patrick's high school in vallejo, where he excelled at track, football, and wrestling. those who knew mr. vegas admired him for his generosity and his empathy. together with his wife sandra, he ran a non-profit called fostering greatness that offered mentoring, clothing, and other resources to children in the local foster care system. in his professional career, mr. vegas always focused on keeping others safe. his first job was as operator at the equilon refinery in martinez, california, where he was also a rescue team member and auxiliary firefighter. in 1990, he graduated as the valedictorian of the napa valley college police academy, and in 2001, began his career with the richmond police department. officer vegas applied his tremendous ability to connect with others to his work where he fully embodied the ideals of community policing. he went beyond simply deterring crime and arresting suspects to having genuine empathy and a connection to the community he served. officer vegas's aptitude was recognized within the department and he became a property crimes detective rising through the department to become a homicide detective. in these roles, he was not only adept at solving crimes, but shined in his ability to provide empathy and closure for victims' families. officer vegas was versatile in his professional abilities due to his gift to connect with others. in his last assignment, he worked closely with agencies like the richmond city attorney's office and the alcohol beverage control (abc) to enforce the city of richmond's municipal codes. officer vegas cared deeply about his family and considered them the most important part of his life. congressman thompson and i send our deepest condolences to officer vegas' family, including sandra, his wife of 32 years, their five sons, five daughters, and 22 grandchildren. officer vegas made a lasting impression on our community, and he will be greatly missed. ____________________",2766

McDONALD, JR., FIRST JUSTICE, EAST BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT ______ HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH of massachusetts in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of John E. McDonald, Jr., First Justice, East Boston Municipal Court, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to his hometown of Braintree and commend him for being named to the Judges Wall at The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law. John Jr. is the son of John E. and Patricia M. McDonald who raised John Jr. in the Town of Braintree. John relocated to South Boston where he made his residence from 1984-2011, there he met and married his lovely wife Melissa, and had three children, Andrew 13, Jack 5, and Kathryn 4, before moving back to Braintree in 2011, where he and his family now reside. John attended Boston College High School graduating in 1984. Upon graduating Boston College High School, John was accepted to Boston College where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree, in 1988. John was then accepted at prestigious Columbus School of Law at The Catholic University of America where he obtained his Juris Doctor in 1991. Upon his passing the Massachusetts Bar Exam, John worked in the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General as a Law Clerk. In 1991, John joined the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney where he served from 1991 until 1994. In 1994, John went into private practice by opening the Law Office of John E. McDonald, Jr., focusing on his practice as a Sole Practitioner of Criminal and Civil Litigation from 1994-2008. Upon completing his successful private practice, John was named Assistant Clerk Magistrate, Boston Municipal Court, Central Division, where he served until his appointment by Governor Deval Patrick as an Associate Justice of the Central Division of the Boston Municipal Court in May of 2013. In February 2014, John served as the Presiding Justice of the Dorchester Division Drug Court until his appointment as the First Justice of East Boston Division Drug Court where he presently serves. John E. McDonald, Jr., has dedicated his entire professional career to the field of Law. His reputation is impeccable as a judge who goes above and beyond in helping others. John's commitment to the East Boston Community is only exceeded by his love for family, and the betterment of those less fortunate. John has served as the keynote speaker at the Norfolk County Bar Association, The Salvation Army Recovery Program, The East Boston Chamber of Commerce, and has volunteered his time in speaking at many Boston area schools on the issue of substance abuse, and the law. In addition, The Honorable Judge John E. McDonald was also named as a panel member of the highly prestigious ``Panel on Recovery'' and was asked by Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh to speak before the City of Boston ``Recovery Forum.'' Mr. Speaker, John is known for his quick sense of humor, and is a true gentleman in every sense of the word. He has earned the respect of his peers, and when people look back on Judge McDonald's legacy they will remember him as a person who was there for those struggling in the most difficult circumstances. Although the honor of being named to the Judges Wall will be one highlight of many in John's career, he will most assuredly be known for his caring and positive impact on the families of East Boston, South Boston, and Braintree. Mr. Speaker it is my distinct honor to take the floor of the House today to join with John E. McDonald's family, friends, and contemporaries to thank him for his remarkable service and to commend him for the difference he has made to the families of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E198] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF THE HONORABLE JOHN E.

WILLIAM B. BYNUM, JR. ______ HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. William B. Bynum, Jr., a 25-year higher education professional, who was unanimously selected to be the 7th President of Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU) by the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board on October 8, 2013 and he began his presidency at ``The Valley'' on November 6, 2013. A native of Rocky Mount, N.C., Dr. Bynum earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Davidson College while on a student-athlete scholarship. While at Davidson, he also minored in Education and passed the National Teachers Exam. He was subsequently licensed and certified to teach Social Studies and Math in N.C. and Georgia. Dr. Bynum went on to earn his masters and Ph.D. in Sociology from Duke University while serving as a Duke Endowment Fellow. Dr. Bynum was also a member of the inaugural class of the NAFEO-Kellogg Leadership Fellows Program, a year-long program specifically designed to train the next generation of presidents/chancellors for minority serving institutions, which was led by then NAFEO president--Dr. Frederick Humphries; NAFEO chairman--Dr. Joe Johnson, and executive director--Dr. Arthur Thomas. As part of the program, Dr. Bynum ``shadowed'' Dr. Harold Martin, then chancellor of Winston-Salem State University and now chancellor of N.C. A &T State University. As the 7th President, Dr. Bynum's vision for the University is to uplift 6 powerful words that are already deeply rooted in ``The Valley'' culture. The vision is: ONE GOAL. ONE TEAM. ONE VALLEY. The ONE GOAL is Student Success (increased enrollment, retention and graduation; holistic student development and career advancement); The ONE TEAM is University and Community Stakeholders Working Together; And the ONE VALLEY is students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends actively demonstrating School Pride and Spirituality that is second to none! Prior to his appointment at MVSU, Dr. Bynum served as the Vice President for Enrollment Management & Student Services at Morehouse College (2009-2013), where he [[Page E199]] was mentored by Morehouse's 10th president Dr. Robert Michael Franklin. While serving at Morehouse, Dr. Bynum significantly enhanced student- administration relations, improved the efficiency and effectiveness of student services, started, envisioned and led the initiative which established the Parents Council and implemented the nationally acclaimed Morehouse ``Appropriate Attire Policy.'' Prior to Morehouse, Dr. Bynum served as the Vice President for Student Affairs & Enrollment Management (2000-2009) at The Lincoln University (PA). During his nine years of service, he was successful in nearly doubling Lincoln's enrollment and recruited the 4 largest new student classes (900+) in the University's 150 year history. Dr. Bynum also led the Board approved Student Enhancement Initiative, which entailed elevating Lincoln from NCAA Division III to NCAA Division II athletics, reactivated Lincoln's membership in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) conference, returned football to the campus after a 40 year absence and started the University's first marching band program: ``The Orange Crush.'' At Lincoln, Dr. Bynum was mentored by Dr. Ivory Nelson, the University's 12th president, who garnered over $200 million in capital construction to transform the campus physical plant. Prior to LU, Dr. Bynum served as the Associate Vice President and Dean of Students at Clark Atlanta University (1993-2000), and he was the Number 2 person in the division that recruited the 4 largest classes (1500+) in the then 125 year history of CAU. While at CAU, Dr. Bynum was mentored by and developed strong strategic planning and assessment skills from Dr. Doris Walker Weathers. During his CAU days, Dr. Bynum was nicknamed ``Bye-Bye Bynum'' for his no-nonsense approach to judicial affairs and enhancing the campus culture and environment. In addition to his enrollment management and student affairs work, Dr. Bynum has lectured and/or taught as well. He served as the Covington Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Davidson and at Morehouse, he was an adjunct professor in the Leadership Studies program and Sociology department. Dr. Bynum's other professional experience includes research and teaching positions at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Duke University and Durham and Edgecombe Community Colleges. He started his educational career as a teacher, football and wrestling coach in the Rocky Mount (N.C.) City School System (1984-87) and the Dekalb County (GA) School System (1987- 88). Dr. Bynum has represented his institutions in numerous external programs and at professional conferences, while serving as a presenter or moderator. He has authored refereed articles in professional journals and presented papers with academic and social themes. Trained as a Quantitative Sociologist, Dr. Bynum still remains active in research and teaching. His research and teaching interests center around: (1) Black Church Studies; (2) Race, Gender and Ethnicity; and (3) Organizations, Markets and Work. His publications include: A co-authored article with Duke colleagues in the sociology journal Social Forces entitled ``Race and Formal Volunteering''; a chapter entitled ``The Black Church in America: Demography and Current Trends'' in the book: Exploring The African American Experience (3rd edition); and a short story entitled ``For the Love of J-Ski'' in the NASPA produced book: Stories of Inspiration: Lessons and Laughter in Student Affairs. Dr. Bynum is a member of Omicron Delta Kappa, Chi Alpha Epsilon and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. A God-loving, God-fearing man, he is married to Deborah Elaine Bynum, a manager and 34 year employee with AT&T Mobility Services, and they are the proud parents of six children--Tyrone (a student at Georgia State University), Tyler (a student-athlete graduate of Truett- McConnell College), Chelsea (a student at Clark Atlanta University and Army Reservist), Zack (a student at Morehouse College), Jordan and Jazz (both of whom are Atlanta Public high school students). Dr. Bynum's personal and professional motto is ``Look back and thank God. Look forward and trust God. Look around and serve God. Look within and find God.'' Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. William B. Bynum, Jr., a teacher, professional and educator for his contribution to serving others and giving back to the African American community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E198-E199] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR.

Located in Skyforest, LouEddie's is not only well known for their delicious cuisine but also for their contributions to local causes, which include the Skyforest Festival and the Special Olympian dinner. Finally, it is an honor to recognize the Rim Educational Foundation as the ``Non-Profit of the Year.'' Founded in 1987, the foundation raises money for local schools to cover gaps in state public education funding. Last year the foundation raised $450,000, with 75 percent of those funds going directly to classrooms and the remainder was donated to the Advancement through Individual Determination (AVID) program. This certainly is a remarkable achievement.

CREC-2016-02-23-pt1-PgE199-2,CREC-2016-02-23,114,HONORING BARBARA CHRISTENSEN UPON HER RETIREMENT FROM THE SAN MATEO COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E199-E200] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BARBARA CHRISTENSEN UPON HER RETIREMENT FROM THE SAN MATEO COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ______ HON. JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Ms. Barbara Christensen upon her retirement as a senior administrator in the San Mateo County Community College District. In the manner of an Olympic decathlon athlete, Barbara Christensen has exceeded the bar in the full range of professional activities over the years, and the people of San Mateo County have been the beneficiary. Hired forty years ago by the district to handle public affairs, Barbara performed her job well but quickly realized that a reorganization was needed. Soon, each campus of the community college district was communicating professionally with the public, leading to greater responsiveness to the public and to the development of an individual identity for each campus. It is a brave professional who defines her way out of a job, but Barbara quickly moved on to even greater challenges. This job title doesn't formally exist at the college district, and I'll admit that it's a mouthful, but Barbara Christensen should bear the title of ``Chief Land Use Wonk and Go-To-Person With Respect to Frogs and Butterflies.'' While guiding the district's various developments, she oversaw the creation of four CEQA compliance documents, one of which involved the creation of a habitat conservation plan for frogs and butterflies. Her leadership in the development of apartments for faculty and staff of the district, renting at 50% of market rate in the Bay Area's challenging housing market, has thrilled employees and concretely demonstrated that the district cares about them and their families. The two developments that she shepherded through sometimes contentious public hearings earned national recognition and have inspired other local agencies to seriously consider constructing affordable housing for public employees. Barbara Christensen led the effort to establish the relationship between the universities and community colleges in San Mateo, and we now have four year degree programs taught at Canada College, offering this campus' diverse student body, many of them first-generation college students, an affordable, convenient option to obtain a four year college degree. She secured a $1 million state grant to begin this University Center at Canada College. As our community colleges flourished, Barbara's contribution to their success became even greater. She spearheaded three successful bond measures totaling $1 billion. Today, the stunning community college campuses of San Mateo County look like every modern and highly selective college in the nation. The list of Barbara's successes in the community college professional decathlon is too long to recite, but her willingness to find ``win- win'' choices for contentious issues placed her at the center of four decades of successful negotiations with local taxing entities, nearby homeowners, other districts, and the State of [[Page E200]] California's personnel. She has been recognized professionally by national public information officer associations and served on the statewide board of the community college public relations professionals. Mr. Speaker and members, a college education empowers a student to be a better citizen and a stronger participant in our nation's economy. Our community colleges are at the center of our nation's college system, offering affordable college and technical degrees to millions annually. Given the importance of our district and the hundreds of thousands who have been educated during her service, Barbara Christensen's contribution to San Mateo County over four decades will be felt for at least another four decades. We celebrate her retirement, wish her well, and hope that she can now have more time for friends and family. She has sculpted both the educational and physical landscape of San Mateo County. There will be big shoes to fill, and a big smile to emulate. Her example will inspire others because San Mateo County's residents are all the beneficiaries of the career of Barbara Christensen. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E199-E200] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BARBARA CHRISTENSEN UPON HER RETIREMENT FROM THE SAN MATEO COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ______ HON.

CEDRIC L. RICHMOND of louisiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the academic achievement of a bright young lady from my Congressional district, Keiana Cave. Keiana is just a senior at Lusher Charter School in New Orleans, Louisiana, but she has accomplished more than many college graduates. Keiana has excelled in and out of the classroom. She has studied engineering while at Lusher, and has been dual enrolled at Tulane University, where she has taken biological anthropology and environmental geology courses. She is on a fast track to earn her Ph.D. and has already been recruited by other notable institutions. Keiana is no stranger to the laboratory. She is currently a member of Tulane University's Van Bael lab and has previously served as a lab technician with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and a nanotechnology researcher at the University of New Orleans. She has been acknowledged many times for her work, including 1st Place U.S. Navy/U.S. Marine Corps Office of Naval Research Scholarship and 1st Place United States Air Force Certificate of Achievement. Keiana's chemical research project won second place out of 2,600 competitors at the 2015 International Science and Engineering Fair, winning $1,500.00 as well as receiving honorable mention from the Consortium for Ocean Leadership. Keiana designed a method that allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop certain aidehydes or toxins that form as photo- products during oil spills. The MIT Lincoln Laboratory and NASA have named the orbiting rock ``2000 GD136'' after Keiana, an honor shared by fewer than 15,000 people. The planet was discovered in 2000 by the Lincoln Laboratory team. Keiana's accomplishments are a testament to the fact that she is a true leader and an ideal role model for other young people in the community. I am confident that she will take that responsibility seriously, that she will be able to rise to any challenge, and will work hard to improve the world around her. I would like to congratulate Keiana Cave on her remarkable accomplishments and wish her the best in her future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E200] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS OF KEIANA CAVE ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alhaji Saccoh for his outstanding humanitarian work. A volunteer firefighter in Collingdale, PA, Mr. Saccoh has led an effort to provide undersupplied firefighters in his native Sierra Leone with desperately needed equipment. In June of 2013, Mr. Saccoh made his first trip to Sierra Leone since fleeing the country's civil war in 2000. A chance visit to Sierra Leone's National Fire Service in Freetown brought him face to face with the state of his homeland's fire departments. The firefighters he met lacked even the most basic protective gear and would frequently respond to calls in their street clothes. This encounter inspired Mr. Saccoh to spearhead an effort to collect used fire gear for his counterparts in Sierra Leone. He recently returned from a trip to Sierra Leone, during which he volunteered for two months with local firefighters and distributed approximately $50,000 worth of equipment donated by several fire companies in Delaware County. Mr. Saccoh's humanitarian work extends beyond his work with Sierra Leonean firefighters. A graduate of University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Saccoh is also the founder of the Sierra Leone Children's Fund, a nonprofit organization that promotes health and primary education in rural Sierra Leone. For his work, Mr. Saccoh has been awarded the Legion of Honor from the Chapel of the Four Chaplains and recently received a Wells Fargo Community Connections Grant.

AZIZ SANCAR ______ HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize the tremendous accomplishment of Dr. Aziz Sancar for winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He and his team have been working for decades to understand human DNA more thoroughly, and have recently made a breakthrough in mapping DNA repair. Originally from Turkey, Dr. Sancar earned his Ph.D. in molecular and cell biology from the University of Texas at Dallas in 1977. It was during his time at UT-Dallas that Dr. Sancar successfully purified and described a bacterial enzyme called photolyase. This discovery was integral to his work that won him the Nobel Prize. Dr. Sancar was granted the status as a distinguished alumnus of UT-Dallas in 2009. His Nobel Prize is the icing atop the cake of his everlasting contribution to UT-Dallas and its doctoral program in molecular and cell biology. He is the first alumnus to win a Nobel Prize. Dr. Sancar is the Sarah Graham Kenan Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. He has been there since 1982. The work he has done at his lab on mapping the cellular mechanisms that underlie DNA repair, which occurs every single minute of the day in response to damage caused by outside forces, such as ultraviolet radiation and other environmental factors, is the reason he won the Nobel Prize. In particular, Sancar mapped nucleotide excision repair, which is vital to DNA subjected to UV damage. His work will create a better system of identifying how cancer drugs target cancer cells, and will improve treatment. Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the U.S. Turkish Congressional Caucus, I want to express how much I value Turkish Americans' scientific, political, athletic and artistic contributions to America's rich mosaic. I congratulate Dr. Sancar for his hard work in mapping DNA repair, potential for advancements in cancer treatment, and pride he has brought UT-Dallas and the greater Dallas community in winning the Nobel Prize. And therefore, I want to formally recognize the brilliant Dr. Aziz Sancar in the U.S. House of Representatives. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E201] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY BEING AWARDED TO DR.

DANIELS ______ HON. ROBERT A. BRADY of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Grace H. Daniels for her service to the city of Philadelphia. A force in Philadelphia politics and an unwavering advocate for Philadelphia's African American community from the late 1940s until her death in 1980, Grace's lifetime of service to the people of Philadelphia will be recognized this month when 46th Street is renamed Grace H. Daniels Way in her honor. Shortly after becoming one of the first African-American women to graduate from Duke University, Grace came to Philadelphia in the 1940s with her husband Otis and their large family. Settling into their new home on 46th Street, Grace quickly became active in the community and as a parent of nine children in the Philadelphia School District. It should be no surprise that Grace's desire to help better her community led her to develop an interest in politics. She was elected Democratic Committeewoman of Philadelphia's 44th Ward in 1947. She later became chairperson of the 44th Ward in 1967 and a member of the Democrat State Committee in 1977, positions she would hold until her death in 1980. During her time in Philadelphia politics, Grace developed a reputation as a loyal and dedicated leader who always paid close attention to the needs of her constituents. Although she is no longer with us, Grace left behind an enduring legacy of strong leadership and activism. She is an important part of Philadelphia's history and I am proud that 46th Street will be renamed in her honor. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues help me in honoring the life and memory of Grace H. Daniels. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E201] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING GRACE H.

Daniels Way in her honor. Shortly after becoming one of the first African-American women to graduate from Duke University, Grace came to Philadelphia in the 1940s with her husband Otis and their large family. Settling into their new home on 46th Street, Grace quickly became active in the community and as a parent of nine children in the Philadelphia School District. It should be no surprise that Grace's desire to help better her community led her to develop an interest in politics. She was elected Democratic Committeewoman of Philadelphia's 44th Ward in 1947. She later became chairperson of the 44th Ward in 1967 and a member of the Democrat State Committee in 1977, positions she would hold until her death in 1980. During her time in Philadelphia politics, Grace developed a reputation as a loyal and dedicated leader who always paid close attention to the needs of her constituents. Although she is no longer with us, Grace left behind an enduring legacy of strong leadership and activism. She is an important part of Philadelphia's history and I am proud that 46th Street will be renamed in her honor.

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise on #RestorationTuesday to honor the foot soldiers of the Voting Rights Movement. On March 7th of last year, while aboard Air Force One en route to Selma for the 50th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday, President Obama signed the legislation I introduced to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Foot Soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, and the final Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights Marches in 1965. On that day, 50 years after the march, thousands of grateful Americans gathered in my hometown to celebrate and honor the brave foot soldiers and all they sacrificed in pursuit of equality, justice, and voting rights. Democrats stood side by side with Republicans, and the first African American President in our nation's history stood next to President George W. Bush who reauthorized the Voting Rights Act just nine years earlier. On that day, we shed our party loyalties and came together as Americans. Sadly, I stand on the floor of the House almost one year later, and Republicans continue to refuse to bring legislation to restore voting rights to the floor for a simple up or down vote. The progress that was paid for with the blood of the foot soldiers is being rolled back, and Congress has done nothing. Tomorrow, Republicans and Democrats will come together again, this time in our Nation's Capitol, to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers who showed such bravery 50 years ago. They deserve to be recognized by our country's leaders, but this Congress should be giving them much more than a medal. They should protect the sacred voting rights that these brave men and women marched for 50 years ago. As we are joined tomorrow by the foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement, I beg my colleagues to reflect on the sacrifice they made, as well as the ideals they fought for. These heroic everyday Americans were confronted with violence and injustice, but were not discouraged from fighting for their God given rights. I hope that their presence can inspire every member of this Congress to #RestoreTheVote. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E201] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESTORE THE VOTE ______ HON.

And then he decided to set his sights on a career in journalism and was hired as a clerk at the Philadelphia Inquirer. During his 43-year career at the Inquirer, he rose through the ranks from clerk to reporter, columnist, member and associate editor of the editorial board and ultimately was named the newspaper's Associate Editor Emeritus. Along the way he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting and was named a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. While his primary focus was reporting the news, he also dedicated himself to opening the doors of the esteemed fourth estate to minorities. He was a founder of the Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists. And, because of his advocacy the complexion of journalists in newsrooms across the nation changed. He also co-produced and hosted a groundbreaking television program, on PBS, ``Black Perspective on the News.'' The program attracted African American journalists from across the country, focusing on national issues. In spite of his accomplishments he never stopped being a man of the people, proudly representing his community. He was as comfortable interviewing mayors, judges and congresspersons as he was interviewing sanitation workers and the lady on the block holding a bat as she attempted to rid her neighborhood of gang violence. Today there are hundreds of young people of color who are working journalists because they were mentored by Mr. Moore, or they were part of minority high school journalism programs he began or were simply inspired by his advocacy to make American journalism more inclusive. With his death we have lost a powerful voice, but he has left such a legacy of dedication to journalism, justice and inclusion that we are all forever changed.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E202] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ACEL MOORE SR. ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago today, a pivotal event occurred in Montgomery, Alabama, the birthplace of the modern Civil Rights Movement. On this day 60 years ago, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which began on December 5, 1955, after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man and move to ``Colored'' section in the back of the bus, was in its 57th day. To that point, the boycott had enjoyed remarkable success. Morning buses that normally would be crowded with African Americans heading to work throughout the city were essentially empty. Instead, many African Americans gathered near the bus stops, waiting for rides, many of which came from whites whose primary interest was getting their domestic employees to their homes or other workers to their places of business. Others rode Negro taxis, with many drivers giving reduced fares that day. But thousands more walked to work and school. An estimated that some 17,000 African Americans took part in the boycott initially, a number that would grow to 42,000, aided in part by the action by the bus system itself. In particular, within days after the boycott began, bus officials asked the Montgomery City Commission for permission to close routes to many of the primary black communities, arguing that the boycott had made service to those areas no longer financially attractive. So in those parts of town, even the handful of African Americans who might have wanted to use the buses could not do so. [[Page E202]] In the early days of the boycott African American taxi companies helped transport former bus riders and did so for the reduced fare of 10 cents per ride. In retaliation, city officials began strictly enforcing a long dormant city ordinance that set minimum fares at 45 cents, which priced taxi rides on a daily basis out of the reach of many working-class African Americans. But despite the backlash, retaliation, and harassment by the local police, the boycott would not be broken. The most sweeping official action designed to intimidate boycott leaders came in February 1956, when the Montgomery grand jury indicted 89 boycott leaders, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Rosa Parks; Rev. Ralph David Abernathy; and several other participating black ministers. The charges were based on a seldom-enforced 1921 state statute that barred boycotts without,``just cause.'' Those indicted were arrested over the next few days, booked and released on bond. But as official tactics failed to discourage the boycott, unofficial intimidation would soon take a more dangerous turn such as the bombing of the parsonage in which King and his family lived was bombed. Mr. Speaker, the Montgomery Bus Boycott showed the nation and the world that there is a limit to a people's patience and tolerance in the face of injustice. In rebelling against the unjust, unfair, dehumanizing, and discriminatory practice of racial segregation, the Montgomery Bus Boycotters were acting in the finest American tradition, following the admonition in the Declaration of Independence that: [A]ll experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Mr. Speaker, the books of literature are filled with stories about the plucky underdog striving and succeeding against the odds but what is amazing and remarkable about the Montgomery Bus Boycott is that it is a modern day story of little David felling mighty Goliath that has the advantage of being true and inspired other successful social movements around the world. The Montgomery Boycott shows that one person can make a difference and can inspire similar acts of courage in others which when combined send out ripples of hope that, as Robert Kennedy, said ``can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.'' Rosa Parks said she acted because she wanted to be free: Whatever my individual desires were to be free, I was not alone. There were many others who felt the same way. And inspired by her example, others acted, and then joined by the actions of others, and then still others, the bus boycott succeeded. Mr. Speaker, 60 years has passed since a small band of committed activists, armed only with their faith in a righteous cause, won the battle of Montgomery and set in motion a movement that tore down the walls of legalized injustice across the South. They changed America for the better and for that we owe them an eternal debt of gratitude. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 28 (Tuesday, February 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E201-E202] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 23, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago today, a pivotal event occurred in Montgomery, Alabama, the birthplace of the modern Civil Rights Movement. On this day 60 years ago, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which began on December 5, 1955, after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man and move to ``Colored'' section in the back of the bus, was in its 57th day. To that point, the boycott had enjoyed remarkable success. Morning buses that normally would be crowded with African Americans heading to work throughout the city were essentially empty. Instead, many African Americans gathered near the bus stops, waiting for rides, many of which came from whites whose primary interest was getting their domestic employees to their homes or other workers to their places of business. Others rode Negro taxis, with many drivers giving reduced fares that day. But thousands more walked to work and school. An estimated that some 17,000 African Americans took part in the boycott initially, a number that would grow to 42,000, aided in part by the action by the bus system itself. In particular, within days after the boycott began, bus officials asked the Montgomery City Commission for permission to close routes to many of the primary black communities, arguing that the boycott had made service to those areas no longer financially attractive. So in those parts of town, even the handful of African Americans who might have wanted to use the buses could not do so. [[Page E202]] In the early days of the boycott African American taxi companies helped transport former bus riders and did so for the reduced fare of 10 cents per ride. In retaliation, city officials began strictly enforcing a long dormant city ordinance that set minimum fares at 45 cents, which priced taxi rides on a daily basis out of the reach of many working-class African Americans. But despite the backlash, retaliation, and harassment by the local police, the boycott would not be broken. The most sweeping official action designed to intimidate boycott leaders came in February 1956, when the Montgomery grand jury indicted 89 boycott leaders, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Rosa Parks; Rev. Ralph David Abernathy; and several other participating black ministers. The charges were based on a seldom-enforced 1921 state statute that barred boycotts without,``just cause.'' Those indicted were arrested over the next few days, booked and released on bond. But as official tactics failed to discourage the boycott, unofficial intimidation would soon take a more dangerous turn such as the bombing of the parsonage in which King and his family lived was bombed. Mr. Speaker, the Montgomery Bus Boycott showed the nation and the world that there is a limit to a people's patience and tolerance in the face of injustice. In rebelling against the unjust, unfair, dehumanizing, and discriminatory practice of racial segregation, the Montgomery Bus Boycotters were acting in the finest American tradition, following the admonition in the Declaration of Independence that: [A]ll experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Mr. Speaker, the books of literature are filled with stories about the plucky underdog striving and succeeding against the odds but what is amazing and remarkable about the Montgomery Bus Boycott is that it is a modern day story of little David felling mighty Goliath that has the advantage of being true and inspired other successful social movements around the world. The Montgomery Boycott shows that one person can make a difference and can inspire similar acts of courage in others which when combined send out ripples of hope that, as Robert Kennedy, said ``can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.'' Rosa Parks said she acted because she wanted to be free: Whatever my individual desires were to be free, I was not alone. There were many others who felt the same way. And inspired by her example, others acted, and then joined by the actions of others, and then still others, the bus boycott succeeded. Mr. Speaker, 60 years has passed since a small band of committed activists, armed only with their faith in a righteous cause, won the battle of Montgomery and set in motion a movement that tore down the walls of legalized injustice across the South. They changed America for the better and for that we owe them an eternal debt of gratitude. ____________________",package_114_144.csv,5187,5187,5258,"[congressional record volume 162, number 28 (tuesday, february 23, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e201-e202] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] commemorating 60th anniversary of a pivotal moment in montgomery bus boycott ______ hon. sheila jackson lee of texas in the house of representatives tuesday, february 23, 2016 ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, 60 years ago today, a pivotal event occurred in montgomery, alabama, the birthplace of the modern civil rights movement. on this day 60 years ago, the montgomery bus boycott, which began on december 5, 1955, after rosa parks refused to give up her seat to a white man and move to ``colored'' section in the back of the bus, was in its 57th day. to that point, the boycott had enjoyed remarkable success. morning buses that normally would be crowded with african americans heading to work throughout the city were essentially empty. instead, many african americans gathered near the bus stops, waiting for rides, many of which came from whites whose primary interest was getting their domestic employees to their homes or other workers to their places of business. others rode negro taxis, with many drivers giving reduced fares that day. but thousands more walked to work and school. an estimated that some 17,000 african americans took part in the boycott initially, a number that would grow to 42,000, aided in part by the action by the bus system itself. in particular, within days after the boycott began, bus officials asked the montgomery city commission for permission to close routes to many of the primary black communities, arguing that the boycott had made service to those areas no longer financially attractive. so in those parts of town, even the handful of african americans who might have wanted to use the buses could not do so.
