CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgH1004,CREC-2016-02-29,114,OPIOID AND HEROIN ABUSE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Page H1004] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OPIOID AND HEROIN ABUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, on December 22, 2015, Zachary Paul-Allen Greenough, a veteran of the U.S. Army, lost his life to an accidental overdose of heroin in the city of West Haven, Connecticut. The press accounts after his death, unfortunately, tell a story that is far too common in this country. During the time that he served in the Army, he suffered an injury, which caused great pain and resulted in the prescription of painkillers. That pathway started, which led to an opioid addiction and, unfortunately, him losing his life on December 22 to an overdose of heroin. The Centers for Disease Control tells us that, in 2014, 27,000 Americans suffered accidental overdose deaths across the country, a drastic increase from 2013. This trend is happening again all across the country. In the State of Connecticut, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner reported its statistics for 2015, which showed that 723 individuals lost their life, including Mr. Greenough, to overdoses of heroin and opioids. Again, this is a trend line which shows that it was a 20 percent increase from the year before. We are in the midst right now of a problem that is sweeping across the country, that is affecting States that are Republican and Democrat, blue and red, and we as a Nation need to get all hands on deck and come to grips with it. President Obama, in his budget that he submitted a few weeks ago, made a promising start. He proposed $1.1 billion in new funding to law enforcement, to folks who are involved in treatment, whether it is detox centers or treatment programs, or whether it is programs for education and prevention; because we know, from talking to people in the field, you need to get early and quickly to young people to make sure that they understand that this pathway, which has exploded across the country, is something that people need to know about and to avoid. In New London, Connecticut, over the course of 2 days in February, we had a summit involving law enforcement, healthcare providers, and others. We had the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy from the White House, Michael Botticelli, come in. Again, the good news is that there is a lot of good work that is being done at the local level--not just in New London County, Connecticut, but all across the country--where people understand that this is a problem that requires everyone working together in all those factions and all those sectors. But the fact of the matter is that President Obama's proposal is not until 2017. We need help now. We need to get an emergency appropriation, just as we would if there were a hurricane or an earthquake or a wildfire that was sweeping across different regions of this country. We need to understand that emergency appropriations for our military, which the Speaker and I will be voting on together in the Committee on Armed Services, that this problem which is affecting thousands of families and resulting in fatalities for people, again, who follow a pathway that, through legally prescribed medications, needs to be addressed, and we need to get those resources out to people as soon as possible. I have a bill in the House that tracks a bill sponsored by Senator Shaheen in New Hampshire, another State that has been hit hard by the problem. The bill provides $600 million of emergency assistance--again allocated to police, providers, education, and prevention--and this week they will begin consideration in the U.S. Senate. It has been endorsed by law enforcement groups. It has been endorsed by people who are in the field dealing with this problem, who are dealing with families who can't get beds in detox centers, who can't get beds in treatment facilities, with police departments that are trying to get Narcan, a miracle drug, so that they can save lives. But the fact of the matter is we need everybody involved, particularly the Congress, to help communities solve this problem. Last week the National Governors Association--Republicans and Democrats--convened in Washington, D.C., to talk about their priorities. This emergency funding was their number one request to Congress because they are the ones on the front lines who are being confronted and forced to deal with this issue. We have an opportunity to listen to the people who know what they are talking about, to just drain away the politics and the partisanship and understand that veterans, people living in rural communities, people living in suburban communities, people living in urban areas of our country are getting hit with this problem. Just like any other disaster, we as a Nation need to come together to address it now and not wait for 2017--now--to pass this measure. We can do more in terms of reforming the protocols, as the VA and DOD and the civilian healthcare sector, frankly, have gone too far in terms of overprescribing. We can do more about the disposal of drugs. Walgreens, to their credit, has set up disposal sites all across the country where people can come in with excess opioids to get rid of them safely. The fact of the matter is that the willingness is there but the resources are not to deal with a problem of this magnitude. Let's pass the Shaheen-Courtney measure. Let's get emergency funding to the folks who need that help and who are ready. They are on standby. They are there to help those families and those individuals who need the help that we, as Americans, should come together and support. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Page H1004] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OPIOID AND HEROIN ABUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgH1003-4,CREC-2016-02-29,114,WE MUST UPDATE OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1003-H1004] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WE MUST UPDATE OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, every day we are reminded by current events of how essential water and sanitation are to our very existence, whether it is Flint, Michigan, droughts in California, or the challenges of safe drinking water and sanitation for underdeveloped countries. This dominates the news and is at the root of an increasing number of conflicts, which will become only more serious. Water policy is one of the most critical areas that this Congress ought to be able to address on a bipartisan basis. The facts are stark, opportunities vivid, and public support is strong. That is why I have spent a great deal of time focusing on issues of water and sanitation since I first came to Congress. Legislation for international water and sanitation is critical not just for humanitarian reasons, but to protect the environment. It helps avoid conflict within societies and between nations because of water scarcity or shared river basins. I have worked on legislation reforming flood insurance, rewriting the Corps of Engineers' outdated principles and guidelines that should inform their practices on water infrastructure and environmental management, and I have worked for a decade on the creation of a water trust fund. Unlike surface transportation, which has a highway trust fund and a source of revenue, the Federal Government has no similar mechanism for water and sanitation. The status of our water infrastructure is appalling and getting worse, while support from the Federal Government has been in decline. In fact, there has been a slow, steady retreat on water infrastructure spending since the Carter administration. The American Society of Civil Engineers has rated our water infrastructure a D. We have almost 170,000 drinking water systems around the country. While the useful life of pipes can be sometimes up to 100 years, we have facilities that date back to the 1800s. A water main breaks every 2 minutes. The American Water Works Association anticipates the need of a trillion dollars, over the next 25 years, to replace the most critical of more than a million miles of pipe, while congressional appropriations have declined to less than $1.5 billion a year, a tiny fraction of our needs. The total mileage of sewer mains in the United States is unknown, but it is probably between 700,000 and 800,000 miles. Many of these pipes were installed right after World War II and are approaching the end of their useful life. The sewer systems with aging pipes and inadequate capacity mean almost a trillion gallons of untreated sewage each year that is discharged into our waterways. The total needs over the next 20 years for both sewer and water are almost beyond our comprehension, but the current spending, it is clear, is completely inadequate. The public and the scientists are finding more problems, which will argue for even higher standards. That is why I have developed bipartisan legislation for the creation of a water trust fund. I have been working on this for years with different bipartisan partners. Given that there appears to be little appetite now in Congress for any tax or fee increase, I have adjusted the bill so that the revenue comes from voluntary participation by companies that have a keen interest in clean drinking water and adequate sanitation--indeed, their very business depends on it. They would be able, for a tiny fee, to voluntarily identify as being supportive of the water trust fund. A little seal of approval would raise several billion dollars a year. This could be used to deal with the problems of low-income ratepayers that make it hard for overall rates to be increased and to leverage more investment at a time of remarkably low costs of borrowing.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, every day we are reminded by current events of how essential water and sanitation are to our very existence, whether it is Flint, Michigan, droughts in California, or the challenges of safe drinking water and sanitation for underdeveloped countries. This dominates the news and is at the root of an increasing number of conflicts, which will become only more serious. Water policy is one of the most critical areas that this Congress ought to be able to address on a bipartisan basis. The facts are stark, opportunities vivid, and public support is strong. That is why I have spent a great deal of time focusing on issues of water and sanitation since I first came to Congress. Legislation for international water and sanitation is critical not just for humanitarian reasons, but to protect the environment. It helps avoid conflict within societies and between nations because of water scarcity or shared river basins. I have worked on legislation reforming flood insurance, rewriting the Corps of Engineers' outdated principles and guidelines that should inform their practices on water infrastructure and environmental management, and I have worked for a decade on the creation of a water trust fund. Unlike surface transportation, which has a highway trust fund and a source of revenue, the Federal Government has no similar mechanism for water and sanitation. The status of our water infrastructure is appalling and getting worse, while support from the Federal Government has been in decline. In fact, there has been a slow, steady retreat on water infrastructure spending since the Carter administration. The American Society of Civil Engineers has rated our water infrastructure a D. We have almost 170,000 drinking water systems around the country. While the useful life of pipes can be sometimes up to 100 years, we have facilities that date back to the 1800s. A water main breaks every 2 minutes. The American Water Works Association anticipates the need of a trillion dollars, over the next 25 years, to replace the most critical of more than a million miles of pipe, while congressional appropriations have declined to less than $1.5 billion a year, a tiny fraction of our needs. The total mileage of sewer mains in the United States is unknown, but it is probably between 700,000 and 800,000 miles. Many of these pipes were installed right after World War II and are approaching the end of their useful life. The sewer systems with aging pipes and inadequate capacity mean almost a trillion gallons of untreated sewage each year that is discharged into our waterways. The total needs over the next 20 years for both sewer and water are almost beyond our comprehension, but the current spending, it is clear, is completely inadequate. The public and the scientists are finding more problems, which will argue for even higher standards. That is why I have developed bipartisan legislation for the creation of a water trust fund. I have been working on this for years with different bipartisan partners. Given that there appears to be little appetite now in Congress for any tax or fee increase, I have adjusted the bill so that the revenue comes from voluntary participation by companies that have a keen interest in clean drinking water and adequate sanitation--indeed, their very business depends on it. They would be able, for a tiny fee, to voluntarily identify as being supportive of the water trust fund. A little seal of approval would raise several billion dollars a year. This could be used to deal with the problems of low-income ratepayers that make it hard for overall rates to be increased and to leverage more investment at a time of remarkably low costs of borrowing. We could have significant investment to deal with some of our greatest problems. This is by no means the entire answer to the looming crisis, but we shouldn't wait for the next Flint or the problems in drought-stricken California or some other municipal breakdown.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4238) to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 to modernize terms relating to minorities. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4238 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. MODERNIZATION OF TERMS RELATING TO MINORITIES. (a) Office of Minority Economic Impact.--Section 211(f)(1) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7141(f)(1)) is amended by striking ``a Negro, Puerto Rican, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent'' and inserting ``Asian American, Native Hawaiian, a Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Native American, or an Alaska Native''. (b) Minority Business Enterprises.--Section 106(f)(2) of the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6705(f)(2)) is amended by striking ``Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts'' and inserting ``Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders, African American, Hispanic, Native American, or Alaska Natives''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to consider H.R. 4238, a bill to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 to modernize terms in the original legislation relating to minorities. This bill replaces offensive terms relating to minorities found in decades-old energy legislation. I want to thank Grace Meng for being the lead on this commonsense piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from the great State of New York (Ms. Meng) for her work in bringing forth H.R. 4238, a bill to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 to modernize terms relating to minorities. Mr. Speaker, this commonsense bill received unanimous bipartisan support when it came before both the Energy and Power Subcommittee, on which I serve as the ranking member, and when it came before the full Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Speaker, words matter. This bill strikes outdated, offensive terms related to minorities out of the Federal statute that can be found in the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976. Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward bill that helps bring these statutes up to modern times and into the 21st century, at least as far as getting rid of these offensive terms is concerned. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng). Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that H.R. 4238 has made it to the House floor today. As you know, this bill will strike the term ``Oriental'' from Federal law in the last two places it is used to refer to a person. This legislation is long overdue, and I am thankful for your consideration and, I hope, passage of it. I would like to thank my colleague and friend, Representative Ed Royce, for being an original author of this bill with me, as well as every member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. I would also like to thank Representative Butterfield and Representative Sanchez, chairs of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus, respectively, for cosponsoring this legislation. I would also like to personally thank Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone for shepherding this legislation through the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as Representatives Whitfield and Rush, who moved it through the Energy and Power Subcommittee. We are all aware that there are chapters of American history that are not perfect. This very body, for example, once found it appropriate to pass laws such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Geary Act. But we also found it appropriate to repeal them. Times change, what is acceptable changes, and this Congress more often than not yields to that change. Toward that end, the time has come to repeal certain terms from Federal law that many in the Asian American community would find offensive. In the same way I would not want either of my children to be referred to as ``Orientals'' by their teachers at school, I hope we can agree that such terms no longer deserve a place in Federal law. Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing this legislation to the floor for a vote today. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important measure. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank once again Ms. Grace [[Page H1006]] Meng for bringing this important issue to the attention of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I would urge all Members to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 4238, which was introduced by my colleague, the gentlewoman from New York, Representative Meng. Racism and discrimination have no place in America today. We are a nation of immigrants that is proud of its diversity. Despite our society's progression and growth over the last 100 years, the Federal Code still contains language on ethnicity that is antiquated, and, quite frankly, inappropriate. For example, the term ``Orientals'' is offensive, especially so when referring to the vibrant Asian American community. Using this term in federal law lends it a legitimacy it doesn't deserve. I strongly believe that when we get the chance, we should correct the mistakes of the past. This bill goes a long way towards correcting our mistakes. H.R. 4238 eliminates outdated, disrespectful terms from federal law and replaces them with terms, such as ``Asian American,'' ``Alaska Natives,'' and ``Hispanic,'' that are more appropriate for our times and in keeping with our values. Last year, Representative Meng and I successfully amended H.R. 8 to strike these derogatory terms, which did not move in the Senate. As an original cosponsor of this standalone bill, I'm very happy that she and I are closer to having this language signed into law and these terms removed for good. Deleting inappropriate terms from the U.S. Code is a simple, yet important, way of demonstrating respect for our Nation's diversity. I strongly support this bill and urge my colleagues in the House to vote in support of it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4238. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1005-H1006] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MODERNIZATION OF TERMS RELATING TO MINORITIES Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4238) to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 to modernize terms relating to minorities. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4238 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. MODERNIZATION OF TERMS RELATING TO MINORITIES. (a) Office of Minority Economic Impact.--Section 211(f)(1) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7141(f)(1)) is amended by striking ``a Negro, Puerto Rican, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent'' and inserting ``Asian American, Native Hawaiian, a Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Native American, or an Alaska Native''. (b) Minority Business Enterprises.--Section 106(f)(2) of the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6705(f)(2)) is amended by striking ``Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts'' and inserting ``Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders, African American, Hispanic, Native American, or Alaska Natives''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to consider H.R. 4238, a bill to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 to modernize terms in the original legislation relating to minorities. This bill replaces offensive terms relating to minorities found in decades-old energy legislation. I want to thank Grace Meng for being the lead on this commonsense piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from the great State of New York (Ms. Meng) for her work in bringing forth H.R. 4238, a bill to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 to modernize terms relating to minorities. Mr. Speaker, this commonsense bill received unanimous bipartisan support when it came before both the Energy and Power Subcommittee, on which I serve as the ranking member, and when it came before the full Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Speaker, words matter. This bill strikes outdated, offensive terms related to minorities out of the Federal statute that can be found in the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976. Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward bill that helps bring these statutes up to modern times and into the 21st century, at least as far as getting rid of these offensive terms is concerned. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng). Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that H.R. 4238 has made it to the House floor today.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the floor today H.R. 4444, the EPS Improvement Act of 2016. I want to give special thanks to our colleagues, Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, Diana DeGette of Colorado, Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Doris Matsui of California, and Mr. Charles Dent of Pennsylvania, for their work on this piece of legislation. I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers). Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank the chairman for yielding on this specific issue and for leading our subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4444, the EPS Improvement Act of 2016. This bipartisan bill would provide certainty to North Carolina lighting manufacturers that provide over 3,000 jobs in my home State. H.R. 4444 will resolve the underlying issues of the Department of Energy External Power Supply rule. In 2005, Congress directed the Department of Energy to develop energy efficiency standards for external power supplies. The DOE initially stated that products intended to be covered by these standards ``convert household electric current into DC or lower voltage AC to operate consumer products such as a laptop computer or a smartphone.'' Years after the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, new technologies such as OLED and LED drivers were introduced into the marketplace. While the development of these drivers increased energy efficiency, it has also caused uncertainty in the manufacturing sector. This is because DOE roped in drivers as products to also be covered under the EPS rule. DOE is now attempting to regulate a product that was not in the marketplace at the time Congress initially directed the Department to set external power supply standards. Both manufacturers and the energy efficiency community agree that this was and is not the intent of Congress. DOE has continued with this misguided rule despite the distinct difference in the design and use of LED drivers to that of the design and use of EPS. One example demonstrating the difference is that EPS uses single-stage power conversion while LED drivers use a two-stage power conversion. Thankfully, H.R. 4444 is a promanufacturing, proconsumer piece of legislation that resolves this problem. It will exclude certain technologies from being included in other broad rulemakings. I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives DeGette, Pompeo, Matsui, and Dent for their leadership on this important issue. Additionally, I would like to thank Chairman Whitfield and the Energy and Power Subcommittee staff for their time and efforts in advancing this legislation. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. [[Page H1007]] Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee--Mrs. Ellmers and Ms. DeGette, in particular--as well as all of my other colleagues who worked on H.R. 4444, the EPS Improvement Act of 2016. This bipartisan piece of legislation would exclude the drivers that power light-emitting diodes, commonly known as LEDs, and direct-current ceiling fans from DOE's energy conservation standards for external power supplies. Mr. Speaker, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress directed DOE to establish conservation standards for external power supplies used to convert household electric current into DC current or lower voltage AC current. At the time, external power supplies were almost exclusively the kind of wall chargers used to power laptops, cell phones, and other similar consumer devices. {time} 1600 Mr. Speaker, in 2005, LED lighting was in its infancy stages. LED lamps were not even on the market then, nor were they available in 2007, when Congress amended the definition of external power supply in the Energy Independence Act of 2007. However, in just over a decade, Mr. Speaker, LED and other high- efficiency, solid-state lighting products have become widely available. These lights provide significant energy-efficiency cost savings to consumers when compared with traditional light bulbs. LEDs get swept up in the energy conservation standards for external power supplies because they are powered by solid-state lighting drivers that bear superficial similarities to the kind of chargers that Congress directed DOE to set standards for. Now, Mr. Speaker, one might ask, if these LEDs are so efficient, how is it that their drivers cannot meet the energy conservation standards for external power supplies? Well, this is simply because in order to comply with the standards, an external power supply must be tested when it is disconnected from the object it is powering. For example, Mr. Speaker, a laptop power supply would have to be tested when it is disconnected from the laptop. LED drivers are not designed to operate when disconnected from LEDs, and so they cannot be tested in the same way as other external power supplies. This means that even though they are indeed very energy efficient, they cannot comply with the standards. The same is true of a new generation of energy-efficient ceiling fans. Mr. Speaker, to be sure, this legislation still holds these devices accountable to energy and conservation standards. H.R. 4444 makes DOE's authority to prescribe separate energy and conservation standards for LED drivers explicit. Ceiling fans with the direct current motors would still be required to meet DOE energy conservation standards for ceiling fans. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill before us. I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), and that she may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers other than myself, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my thanks to those of my colleague, Mrs. Ellmers. I want to also thank Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone. I want to thank Chairman Whitfield and Ranking Member Rush, Ms. Matsui, Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Dent, and Mrs. Capps, all for supporting this important measure. This bill updates the DOE's energy conservation standards to keep with the innovations that have taken place over the last decade in household and commercial lighting. While the latest lighting may look similar on the exterior, it actually runs on new and exciting technology. Frankly, as you have heard from the other speakers, we need to update our regulatory scheme to keep these innovations going. Specifically, when the Energy and Commerce Committee wrote the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 2005, it directed the Department of Energy to develop a conservation standard for external power supply products. Because of the inadvertently broad definition we created for external power supplies, emerging LED drivers were swept up into a standard that, as you have heard so eloquently from the other speakers, just doesn't make any sense. That means that, although LED drivers are highly energy-efficient, they can't meet the EPS conservation standard, and their ability to compete in the competitive lighting market is now an open question. Now, this might seem like a technicality, but in the real world, this bill is vitally important. Just last week, for example, General Electric and JPMorgan Chase rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to announce a deal for the world's largest single-order installation of LED lighting. GE will install LED lighting at 5,000 JPMorgan Chase bank branches this year, which will cut the bank's lighting bill in half. But unless we pass this bill quickly, the new lighting at JPMorgan Chase locations technically won't meet basic efficiency standards. It is urgent that we pass this bill now and that we pass it quickly through the other body because these new efficiency standards are going into effect. And while everybody agrees LED lighting is important, we are still coming against the letter of the law. And so that is why I want to thank everybody on both sides of the aisle for realizing how incredibly important this is. By passing the EPS Improvement Act of 2016, we will let the LED lighting revolution continue. We will help lower energy prices for every American business and household, and will continue our goal of more and more efficient energy. Mr. Speaker, if my friend across the aisle still has no speakers, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps). Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4444. This overdue legislation is critically important to ensure that the innovation and implementation of LED technologies continues. Our Nation has made great strides toward the production of accessible and affordable clean energy. To continue this momentum, we must do all we can to embrace and support technologies that strive to improve energy efficiency. In so doing, we must support efforts toward greater energy efficiency by supporting technologies that use fewer resources for the same or better results. This allows us to balance our energy consumption with the need to protect the global environment. And that is exactly what this bill does. When it comes to the lighting sector, LED technologies are at the forefront of meeting the efficiency demand. This technology is drastically reducing the energy required to provide light in both residential and industrial settings throughout the country and around the world. While the reach of this technology is amazingly broad, LEDs are incredibly important to my district as well. There is a long history of researching, developing and innovating LEDs technologies in academia, industry, and nonprofits along the central coast of California. The University of California Santa Barbara continues to lead the way in research to improve upon the light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, as we know them. Furthermore, UCSB is fortunate to employ one of the leading researchers in the world, Dr. Shuji Nakamura, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on LEDs. And Cree Lighting, which translates this research into employable technologies has a facility in my district where they are continuing to develop cutting-edge applications for LEDs. The promise of this technology really is a game changer. In fact, the Institute for Energy Efficiency at UC Santa Barbara has worked with the nonprofit Unite for Light to provide reading lights to people across the world, replacing dangerous kerosene lamps still [[Page H1008]] used in places where electricity is not available with solar charged LED reading lights. You know, I have one of these little reading lights in my home. They are about 12 inches tall. This is Unite for Light. Instead of a power cord plugging into the wall, they have two little solar panels at the base. If you set them in the sunlight during the day, then you have the ability in the evening, then a child in a Third World country, or some person who needs to do work or homework at night, can take this little lamp, reading light, and use it to further their employment, their education until we get the infrastructure in place to do that itself. So there is no doubt that LEDs are an important technology to change lighting, as we know it, providing an accessible and efficient source of illumination. H.R. 4444 ensures that the important research and development of LED technologies, such as the activities in my district, will be able to continue and that LEDs will be able to efficiently light the world around us. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank all of those involved in bringing forth this legislation. We are all excited about it. It does teach each one of us a lesson, though, and that is, sometimes we pass legislation, and we use language a little bit too broad; and the regulatory agencies take that and run. And now we see them trying to regulate something that was not even in existence when the 2005 Energy Policy Act was adopted. I don't think that many Members of Congress or the American people ever thought that the Department of Energy would be setting efficiency standards for ceiling fans, for microwave ovens, refrigerators. It reminds me of that Dire Straits song, and I hope you all liked them as much I did, but they had this song entitled ``Money for Nothing'' and the chicks are free. They talked about the importance of moving microwave ovens, refrigerators, and color TVs. We find ourselves today living in a world in which everything is so micromanaged, and this is an example of that action. We understand we need regulations, but I am glad that we have a group of Democrats and Republicans coming together with common sense to say to the Department of Energy, hey, we need some balance here. I would urge passage of this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4444. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1006-H1008] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EPS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. WHITFIELD.

Ceiling fans with the direct current motors would still be required to meet DOE energy conservation standards for ceiling fans. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill before us. I ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), and that she may control that time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers other than myself, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my thanks to those of my colleague, Mrs. Ellmers. I want to also thank Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone. I want to thank Chairman Whitfield and Ranking Member Rush, Ms. Matsui, Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Dent, and Mrs. Capps, all for supporting this important measure. This bill updates the DOE's energy conservation standards to keep with the innovations that have taken place over the last decade in household and commercial lighting. While the latest lighting may look similar on the exterior, it actually runs on new and exciting technology. Frankly, as you have heard from the other speakers, we need to update our regulatory scheme to keep these innovations going. Specifically, when the Energy and Commerce Committee wrote the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 2005, it directed the Department of Energy to develop a conservation standard for external power supply products. Because of the inadvertently broad definition we created for external power supplies, emerging LED drivers were swept up into a standard that, as you have heard so eloquently from the other speakers, just doesn't make any sense. That means that, although LED drivers are highly energy-efficient, they can't meet the EPS conservation standard, and their ability to compete in the competitive lighting market is now an open question. Now, this might seem like a technicality, but in the real world, this bill is vitally important. Just last week, for example, General Electric and JPMorgan Chase rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to announce a deal for the world's largest single-order installation of LED lighting. GE will install LED lighting at 5,000 JPMorgan Chase bank branches this year, which will cut the bank's lighting bill in half. But unless we pass this bill quickly, the new lighting at JPMorgan Chase locations technically won't meet basic efficiency standards. It is urgent that we pass this bill now and that we pass it quickly through the other body because these new efficiency standards are going into effect. And while everybody agrees LED lighting is important, we are still coming against the letter of the law. And so that is why I want to thank everybody on both sides of the aisle for realizing how incredibly important this is. By passing the EPS Improvement Act of 2016, we will let the LED lighting revolution continue. We will help lower energy prices for every American business and household, and will continue our goal of more and more efficient energy. Mr. Speaker, if my friend across the aisle still has no speakers, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps). Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4444. This overdue legislation is critically important to ensure that the innovation and implementation of LED technologies continues. Our Nation has made great strides toward the production of accessible and affordable clean energy. To continue this momentum, we must do all we can to embrace and support technologies that strive to improve energy efficiency. In so doing, we must support efforts toward greater energy efficiency by supporting technologies that use fewer resources for the same or better results. This allows us to balance our energy consumption with the need to protect the global environment. And that is exactly what this bill does. When it comes to the lighting sector, LED technologies are at the forefront of meeting the efficiency demand. This technology is drastically reducing the energy required to provide light in both residential and industrial settings throughout the country and around the world. While the reach of this technology is amazingly broad, LEDs are incredibly important to my district as well. There is a long history of researching, developing and innovating LEDs technologies in academia, industry, and nonprofits along the central coast of California. The University of California Santa Barbara continues to lead the way in research to improve upon the light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, as we know them. Furthermore, UCSB is fortunate to employ one of the leading researchers in the world, Dr. Shuji Nakamura, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on LEDs. And Cree Lighting, which translates this research into employable technologies has a facility in my district where they are continuing to develop cutting-edge applications for LEDs. The promise of this technology really is a game changer. In fact, the Institute for Energy Efficiency at UC Santa Barbara has worked with the nonprofit Unite for Light to provide reading lights to people across the world, replacing dangerous kerosene lamps still [[Page H1008]] used in places where electricity is not available with solar charged LED reading lights. You know, I have one of these little reading lights in my home. They are about 12 inches tall. This is Unite for Light. Instead of a power cord plugging into the wall, they have two little solar panels at the base. If you set them in the sunlight during the day, then you have the ability in the evening, then a child in a Third World country, or some person who needs to do work or homework at night, can take this little lamp, reading light, and use it to further their employment, their education until we get the infrastructure in place to do that itself. So there is no doubt that LEDs are an important technology to change lighting, as we know it, providing an accessible and efficient source of illumination. H.R. 4444 ensures that the important research and development of LED technologies, such as the activities in my district, will be able to continue and that LEDs will be able to efficiently light the world around us. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank all of those involved in bringing forth this legislation. We are all excited about it. It does teach each one of us a lesson, though, and that is, sometimes we pass legislation, and we use language a little bit too broad; and the regulatory agencies take that and run. And now we see them trying to regulate something that was not even in existence when the 2005 Energy Policy Act was adopted. I don't think that many Members of Congress or the American people ever thought that the Department of Energy would be setting efficiency standards for ceiling fans, for microwave ovens, refrigerators. It reminds me of that Dire Straits song, and I hope you all liked them as much I did, but they had this song entitled ``Money for Nothing'' and the chicks are free. They talked about the importance of moving microwave ovens, refrigerators, and color TVs. We find ourselves today living in a world in which everything is so micromanaged, and this is an example of that action. We understand we need regulations, but I am glad that we have a group of Democrats and Republicans coming together with common sense to say to the Department of Energy, hey, we need some balance here. I would urge passage of this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4444. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1006-H1008] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EPS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2016 Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4444) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to exclude power supply circuits, drivers, and devices designed to be connected to, and power, light-emitting diodes or organic light- emitting diodes providing illumination from energy conservation standards for external power supplies, and for other purposes.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring to the floor today H.R. 4444, the EPS Improvement Act of 2016. I want to give special thanks to our colleagues, Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, Diana DeGette of Colorado, Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Doris Matsui of California, and Mr. Charles Dent of Pennsylvania, for their work on this piece of legislation. I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers). Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank the chairman for yielding on this specific issue and for leading our subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4444, the EPS Improvement Act of 2016. This bipartisan bill would provide certainty to North Carolina lighting manufacturers that provide over 3,000 jobs in my home State. H.R. 4444 will resolve the underlying issues of the Department of Energy External Power Supply rule. In 2005, Congress directed the Department of Energy to develop energy efficiency standards for external power supplies. The DOE initially stated that products intended to be covered by these standards ``convert household electric current into DC or lower voltage AC to operate consumer products such as a laptop computer or a smartphone.'' Years after the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, new technologies such as OLED and LED drivers were introduced into the marketplace. While the development of these drivers increased energy efficiency, it has also caused uncertainty in the manufacturing sector. This is because DOE roped in drivers as products to also be covered under the EPS rule. DOE is now attempting to regulate a product that was not in the marketplace at the time Congress initially directed the Department to set external power supply standards. Both manufacturers and the energy efficiency community agree that this was and is not the intent of Congress. DOE has continued with this misguided rule despite the distinct difference in the design and use of LED drivers to that of the design and use of EPS. One example demonstrating the difference is that EPS uses single-stage power conversion while LED drivers use a two-stage power conversion. Thankfully, H.R. 4444 is a promanufacturing, proconsumer piece of legislation that resolves this problem. It will exclude certain technologies from being included in other broad rulemakings. I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives DeGette, Pompeo, Matsui, and Dent for their leadership on this important issue. Additionally, I would like to thank Chairman Whitfield and the Energy and Power Subcommittee staff for their time and efforts in advancing this legislation. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. [[Page H1007]] Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee--Mrs. Ellmers and Ms. DeGette, in particular--as well as all of my other colleagues who worked on H.R. 4444, the EPS Improvement Act of 2016. This bipartisan piece of legislation would exclude the drivers that power light-emitting diodes, commonly known as LEDs, and direct-current ceiling fans from DOE's energy conservation standards for external power supplies. Mr. Speaker, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress directed DOE to establish conservation standards for external power supplies used to convert household electric current into DC current or lower voltage AC current. At the time, external power supplies were almost exclusively the kind of wall chargers used to power laptops, cell phones, and other similar consumer devices. {time} 1600 Mr. Speaker, in 2005, LED lighting was in its infancy stages. LED lamps were not even on the market then, nor were they available in 2007, when Congress amended the definition of external power supply in the Energy Independence Act of 2007. However, in just over a decade, Mr. Speaker, LED and other high- efficiency, solid-state lighting products have become widely available. These lights provide significant energy-efficiency cost savings to consumers when compared with traditional light bulbs. LEDs get swept up in the energy conservation standards for external power supplies because they are powered by solid-state lighting drivers that bear superficial similarities to the kind of chargers that Congress directed DOE to set standards for. Now, Mr. Speaker, one might ask, if these LEDs are so efficient, how is it that their drivers cannot meet the energy conservation standards for external power supplies? Well, this is simply because in order to comply with the standards, an external power supply must be tested when it is disconnected from the object it is powering. For example, Mr. Speaker, a laptop power supply would have to be tested when it is disconnected from the laptop. LED drivers are not designed to operate when disconnected from LEDs, and so they cannot be tested in the same way as other external power supplies. This means that even though they are indeed very energy efficient, they cannot comply with the standards. The same is true of a new generation of energy-efficient ceiling fans. Mr. Speaker, to be sure, this legislation still holds these devices accountable to energy and conservation standards. H.R. 4444 makes DOE's authority to prescribe separate energy and conservation standards for LED drivers explicit. Ceiling fans with the direct current motors would still be required to meet DOE energy conservation standards for ceiling fans. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill before us.

pallone. i want to thank chairman whitfield and ranking member rush, ms. matsui, mr. pompeo, mr. dent, and mrs. capps, all for supporting this important measure. this bill updates the doe's energy conservation standards to keep with the innovations that have taken place over the last decade in household and commercial lighting. while the latest lighting may look similar on the exterior, it actually runs on new and exciting technology. frankly, as you have heard from the other speakers, we need to update our regulatory scheme to keep these innovations going. specifically, when the energy and commerce committee wrote the energy policy and conservation act of 2005, it directed the department of energy to develop a conservation standard for external power supply products. because of the inadvertently broad definition we created for external power supplies, emerging led drivers were swept up into a standard that, as you have heard so eloquently from the other speakers, just doesn't make any sense. that means that, although led drivers are highly energy-efficient, they can't meet the eps conservation standard, and their ability to compete in the competitive lighting market is now an open question. now, this might seem like a technicality, but in the real world, this bill is vitally important. just last week, for example, general electric and jpmorgan chase rang the closing bell at the new york stock exchange to announce a deal for the world's largest single-order installation of led lighting. ge will install led lighting at 5,000 jpmorgan chase bank branches this year, which will cut the bank's lighting bill in half. but unless we pass this bill quickly, the new lighting at jpmorgan chase locations technically won't meet basic efficiency standards. it is urgent that we pass this bill now and that we pass it quickly through the other body because these new efficiency standards are going into effect. and while everybody agrees led lighting is important, we are still coming against the letter of the law. and so that is why i want to thank everybody on both sides of the aisle for realizing how incredibly important this is. by passing the eps improvement act of 2016, we will let the led lighting revolution continue. we will help lower energy prices for every american business and household, and will continue our goal of more and more efficient energy. mr. speaker, if my friend across the aisle still has no speakers, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (mrs. capps). mrs. capps. i thank my colleague for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 4444. this overdue legislation is critically important to ensure that the innovation and implementation of led technologies continues. our nation has made great strides toward the production of accessible and affordable clean energy. to continue this momentum, we must do all we can to embrace and support technologies that strive to improve energy efficiency. in so doing, we must support efforts toward greater energy efficiency by supporting technologies that use fewer resources for the same or better results. this allows us to balance our energy consumption with the need to protect the global environment. and that is exactly what this bill does. when it comes to the lighting sector, led technologies are at the forefront of meeting the efficiency demand. this technology is drastically reducing the energy required to provide light in both residential and industrial settings throughout the country and around the world. while the reach of this technology is amazingly broad, leds are incredibly important to my district as well. there is a long history of researching, developing and innovating leds technologies in academia, industry, and nonprofits along the central coast of california. the university of california santa barbara continues to lead the way in research to improve upon the light-emitting diodes, or leds, as we know them. furthermore, ucsb is fortunate to employ one of the leading researchers in the world, dr. shuji nakamura, who was awarded the nobel prize for his work on leds. and cree lighting, which translates this research into employable technologies has a facility in my district where they are continuing to develop cutting-edge applications for leds. the promise of this technology really is a game changer. in fact, the institute for energy efficiency at uc santa barbara has worked with the nonprofit unite for light to provide reading lights to people across the world, replacing dangerous kerosene lamps still [[page h1008]] used in places where electricity is not available with solar charged led reading lights. you know, i have one of these little reading lights in my home. they are about 12 inches tall. this is unite for light. instead of a power cord plugging into the wall, they have two little solar panels at the base. if you set them in the sunlight during the day, then you have the ability in the evening, then a child in a third world country, or some person who needs to do work or homework at night, can take this little lamp, reading light, and use it to further their employment, their education until we get the infrastructure in place to do that itself. so there is no doubt that leds are an important technology to change lighting, as we know it, providing an accessible and efficient source of illumination. h.r. 4444 ensures that the important research and development of led technologies, such as the activities in my district, will be able to continue and that leds will be able to efficiently light the world around us. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. ms. degette. mr. speaker, having no other speakers, i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i want to thank all of those involved in bringing forth this legislation. we are all excited about it. it does teach each one of us a lesson, though, and that is, sometimes we pass legislation, and we use language a little bit too broad; and the regulatory agencies take that and run. and now we see them trying to regulate something that was not even in existence when the 2005 energy policy act was adopted. i don't think that many members of congress or the american people ever thought that the department of energy would be setting efficiency standards for ceiling fans, for microwave ovens, refrigerators. it reminds me of that dire straits song, and i hope you all liked them as much i did, but they had this song entitled ``money for nothing'' and the chicks are free. they talked about the importance of moving microwave ovens, refrigerators, and color tvs. we find ourselves today living in a world in which everything is so micromanaged, and this is an example of that action. we understand we need regulations, but i am glad that we have a group of democrats and republicans coming together with common sense to say to the department of energy, hey, we need some balance here. i would urge passage of this legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from kentucky (mr. whitfield) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4444. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",17310

General Leave Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 1172, the Edward ``Ted'' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015, introduced by Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware. By building on the Pre-Presidential Transaction Act of 2010, S. 1172 improves the process of Presidential transition by mandating several processes that have been effective in past Presidential transitions. The bill promotes early planning and supports communication by codifying the working groups put in place for the 2010 transition, which was one of the smoothest in our Nation's history. S. 1172 directs the White House to establish a transition council. It requires the General Services Administration to designate a Federal transition coordinator, and it ensures agencies designate staff to manage their internal transition activities needed to support the process of transitioning from one Presidential administration to another. The bill requires that the transition teams be in place no later than 6 months before election day, and it authorizes GSA to provide services for the incoming administration up to 6 months after inauguration. {time} 1800 S. 1172 also requires a report to Congress on national security threats related to terrorism and border security during a transition. The bill further requires the Office of Personnel Management to provide quarterly reports to [[Page H1031]] Congress detailing requests by agencies to appoint political appointees and former political appointees to nonpolitical civil service positions. Mr. Speaker, S. 1172 will help ensure the incoming President has the information necessary to oversee our complex government. Together, these commonsense steps will support future Presidents as they prepare to govern immediately after inauguration. Regardless of party, key management actions must be taken during transitions to support the smooth operation of government. Mr. Speaker, this bill was also referred to the Committee on Homeland Security, and we deeply appreciate their cooperation in getting this bill to the floor. I also would like to thank Senators Johnson and Carper for their work to ensure the upcoming transition remains nonpartisan and supports the continuance of essential government operations. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for an upcoming Presidential transition, I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, December 11, 2015. Hon. Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: On October 9, 2015, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported with an amendment S. 1172, the Edward ``Ted'' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015, by unanimous consent. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an additional referral to the Committee on Homeland Security. I ask that you allow the Homeland Security Committee to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Homeland Security represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, Jason Chaffetz, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, December 11, 2015. Hon. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Chaffetz: Thank you for letter regarding S. 1172, the ``Edward `Ted' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions and Improvements Act of 2015.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in S. 1172 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security, I agree to discharge our Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Committee on Homeland Security takes this action with our mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of S. 1172 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and I ask that your support any such request. To memorialize our understanding, please include a copy of this letter exchange in the report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I appreciate the leadership of Senator Tom Carper in advocating for this bill which would improve the transition process for Presidential administrations. When a new President takes office, it can take months for the new administration to put people in place. This bill would ensure that the Federal Government can continue its important functions during this transition and allow the head of an agency to put career employees in noncareer positions temporarily if necessary. Under this legislation, a senior-level interagency transition council would be established to help develop an effective strategy for each Presidential transition. The General Services Administration would also be required to designate a Federal transition coordinator, and agencies would be required to designate senior career officials to oversee transition activities. This bill would also help the National Archives carry out its mission by authorizing the President to include funds for the Archives to efficiently receive records from the outgoing administration. Several changes were made to this legislation during consideration by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to address concerns raised by Ranking Member Cummings. For example, the Senate version of this bill would have required the Office of Personnel Management to report every quarter on requests for political appointees to convert to career employees. The bill before us today would still require OPM to report this information, but it would only be on an annual basis during nonelection years. This bill will help future Presidents have a smooth and productive transition. I support this bill, and I have no additional speakers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1172, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1028-H1031] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EDWARD ``TED'' KAUFMAN AND MICHAEL LEAVITT PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITIONS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2015 Mr. JODY B.

General Leave Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 1172, the Edward ``Ted'' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015, introduced by Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware. By building on the Pre-Presidential Transaction Act of 2010, S. 1172 improves the process of Presidential transition by mandating several processes that have been effective in past Presidential transitions. The bill promotes early planning and supports communication by codifying the working groups put in place for the 2010 transition, which was one of the smoothest in our Nation's history. S. 1172 directs the White House to establish a transition council. It requires the General Services Administration to designate a Federal transition coordinator, and it ensures agencies designate staff to manage their internal transition activities needed to support the process of transitioning from one Presidential administration to another. The bill requires that the transition teams be in place no later than 6 months before election day, and it authorizes GSA to provide services for the incoming administration up to 6 months after inauguration. {time} 1800 S. 1172 also requires a report to Congress on national security threats related to terrorism and border security during a transition. The bill further requires the Office of Personnel Management to provide quarterly reports to [[Page H1031]] Congress detailing requests by agencies to appoint political appointees and former political appointees to nonpolitical civil service positions. Mr. Speaker, S. 1172 will help ensure the incoming President has the information necessary to oversee our complex government. Together, these commonsense steps will support future Presidents as they prepare to govern immediately after inauguration. Regardless of party, key management actions must be taken during transitions to support the smooth operation of government. Mr. Speaker, this bill was also referred to the Committee on Homeland Security, and we deeply appreciate their cooperation in getting this bill to the floor. I also would like to thank Senators Johnson and Carper for their work to ensure the upcoming transition remains nonpartisan and supports the continuance of essential government operations. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for an upcoming Presidential transition, I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, December 11, 2015. Hon. Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: On October 9, 2015, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported with an amendment S. 1172, the Edward ``Ted'' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015, by unanimous consent. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an additional referral to the Committee on Homeland Security. I ask that you allow the Homeland Security Committee to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Homeland Security represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, Jason Chaffetz, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, December 11, 2015. Hon. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Chaffetz: Thank you for letter regarding S. 1172, the ``Edward `Ted' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions and Improvements Act of 2015.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in S. 1172 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security, I agree to discharge our Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Committee on Homeland Security takes this action with our mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of S. 1172 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and I ask that your support any such request. To memorialize our understanding, please include a copy of this letter exchange in the report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I appreciate the leadership of Senator Tom Carper in advocating for this bill which would improve the transition process for Presidential administrations. When a new President takes office, it can take months for the new administration to put people in place. This bill would ensure that the Federal Government can continue its important functions during this transition and allow the head of an agency to put career employees in noncareer positions temporarily if necessary. Under this legislation, a senior-level interagency transition council would be established to help develop an effective strategy for each Presidential transition. The General Services Administration would also be required to designate a Federal transition coordinator, and agencies would be required to designate senior career officials to oversee transition activities. This bill would also help the National Archives carry out its mission by authorizing the President to include funds for the Archives to efficiently receive records from the outgoing administration. Several changes were made to this legislation during consideration by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to address concerns raised by Ranking Member Cummings. For example, the Senate version of this bill would have required the Office of Personnel Management to report every quarter on requests for political appointees to convert to career employees. The bill before us today would still require OPM to report this information, but it would only be on an annual basis during nonelection years. This bill will help future Presidents have a smooth and productive transition. I support this bill, and I have no additional speakers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1172, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1028-H1031] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EDWARD ``TED'' KAUFMAN AND MICHAEL LEAVITT PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITIONS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2015 Mr. JODY B.

General Leave Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 1172, the Edward ``Ted'' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015, introduced by Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware. By building on the Pre-Presidential Transaction Act of 2010, S. 1172 improves the process of Presidential transition by mandating several processes that have been effective in past Presidential transitions. The bill promotes early planning and supports communication by codifying the working groups put in place for the 2010 transition, which was one of the smoothest in our Nation's history. S. 1172 directs the White House to establish a transition council. It requires the General Services Administration to designate a Federal transition coordinator, and it ensures agencies designate staff to manage their internal transition activities needed to support the process of transitioning from one Presidential administration to another. The bill requires that the transition teams be in place no later than 6 months before election day, and it authorizes GSA to provide services for the incoming administration up to 6 months after inauguration. {time} 1800 S. 1172 also requires a report to Congress on national security threats related to terrorism and border security during a transition. The bill further requires the Office of Personnel Management to provide quarterly reports to [[Page H1031]] Congress detailing requests by agencies to appoint political appointees and former political appointees to nonpolitical civil service positions. Mr. Speaker, S. 1172 will help ensure the incoming President has the information necessary to oversee our complex government. Together, these commonsense steps will support future Presidents as they prepare to govern immediately after inauguration. Regardless of party, key management actions must be taken during transitions to support the smooth operation of government. Mr. Speaker, this bill was also referred to the Committee on Homeland Security, and we deeply appreciate their cooperation in getting this bill to the floor. I also would like to thank Senators Johnson and Carper for their work to ensure the upcoming transition remains nonpartisan and supports the continuance of essential government operations. Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for an upcoming Presidential transition, I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC, December 11, 2015. Hon. Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: On October 9, 2015, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered reported with an amendment S. 1172, the Edward ``Ted'' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015, by unanimous consent. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an additional referral to the Committee on Homeland Security. I ask that you allow the Homeland Security Committee to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Homeland Security represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, Jason Chaffetz, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, December 11, 2015. Hon. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Chaffetz: Thank you for letter regarding S. 1172, the ``Edward `Ted' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions and Improvements Act of 2015.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in S. 1172 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security, I agree to discharge our Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Committee on Homeland Security takes this action with our mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of S. 1172 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and I ask that your support any such request. To memorialize our understanding, please include a copy of this letter exchange in the report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consideration. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I appreciate the leadership of Senator Tom Carper in advocating for this bill which would improve the transition process for Presidential administrations. When a new President takes office, it can take months for the new administration to put people in place. This bill would ensure that the Federal Government can continue its important functions during this transition and allow the head of an agency to put career employees in noncareer positions temporarily if necessary. Under this legislation, a senior-level interagency transition council would be established to help develop an effective strategy for each Presidential transition. The General Services Administration would also be required to designate a Federal transition coordinator, and agencies would be required to designate senior career officials to oversee transition activities. This bill would also help the National Archives carry out its mission by authorizing the President to include funds for the Archives to efficiently receive records from the outgoing administration. Several changes were made to this legislation during consideration by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to address concerns raised by Ranking Member Cummings. For example, the Senate version of this bill would have required the Office of Personnel Management to report every quarter on requests for political appointees to convert to career employees. The bill before us today would still require OPM to report this information, but it would only be on an annual basis during nonelection years. This bill will help future Presidents have a smooth and productive transition. I support this bill, and I have no additional speakers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1172, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,30523,30523,30593,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [house] [pages h1028-h1031] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] edward ``ted'' kaufman and michael leavitt presidential transitions improvements act of 2015 mr. jody b. hice of georgia. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (s. 1172) to improve the process of presidential transition, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: s. 1172 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``edward `ted' kaufman and michael leavitt presidential transitions improvements act of 2015''. sec. 2. presidential transition improvements.

speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from georgia? there was no objection. mr. jody b. hice of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise today in support of s. 1172, the edward ``ted'' kaufman and michael leavitt presidential transitions improvements act of 2015, introduced by senator thomas carper of delaware. by building on the pre-presidential transaction act of 2010, s. 1172 improves the process of presidential transition by mandating several processes that have been effective in past presidential transitions. the bill promotes early planning and supports communication by codifying the working groups put in place for the 2010 transition, which was one of the smoothest in our nation's history. s. 1172 directs the white house to establish a transition council. it requires the general services administration to designate a federal transition coordinator, and it ensures agencies designate staff to manage their internal transition activities needed to support the process of transitioning from one presidential administration to another. the bill requires that the transition teams be in place no later than 6 months before election day, and it authorizes gsa to provide services for the incoming administration up to 6 months after inauguration. {time} 1800 s. 1172 also requires a report to congress on national security threats related to terrorism and border security during a transition. the bill further requires the office of personnel management to provide quarterly reports to [[page h1031]] congress detailing requests by agencies to appoint political appointees and former political appointees to nonpolitical civil service positions. mr. speaker, s. 1172 will help ensure the incoming president has the information necessary to oversee our complex government. together, these commonsense steps will support future presidents as they prepare to govern immediately after inauguration. regardless of party, key management actions must be taken during transitions to support the smooth operation of government. mr. speaker, this bill was also referred to the committee on homeland security, and we deeply appreciate their cooperation in getting this bill to the floor. i also would like to thank senators johnson and carper for their work to ensure the upcoming transition remains nonpartisan and supports the continuance of essential government operations. mr. speaker, as we prepare for an upcoming presidential transition, i urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on oversight and government reform, washington, dc, december 11, 2015. hon. michael t. mccaul, chairman, committee on homeland security, washington, dc. dear mr. chairman: on october 9, 2015, the committee on oversight and government reform ordered reported with an amendment s. 1172, the edward ``ted'' kaufman and michael leavitt presidential transitions improvements act of 2015, by unanimous consent. the bill was referred primarily to the committee on oversight and government reform, with an additional referral to the committee on homeland security. i ask that you allow the homeland security committee to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the majority leader. this discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future referrals. in addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, i would support your request to have the committee on homeland security represented on the conference committee. finally, i would be pleased to include this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the committee on oversight and government reform, as well as in the congressional record during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding. thank you for your consideration of my request. sincerely, jason chaffetz, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on homeland security, washington, dc, december 11, 2015. hon. jason chaffetz, chairman, committee on oversight and government reform, washington, dc. dear chairman chaffetz: thank you for letter regarding s. 1172, the ``edward `ted' kaufman and michael leavitt presidential transitions and improvements act of 2015.'' as a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in s. 1172 that fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security, i agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor for consideration. the committee on homeland security takes this action with our mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of s. 1172 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and i ask that your support any such request. to memorialize our understanding, please include a copy of this letter exchange in the report filed by the committee on oversight and government reform, as well as in the congressional record during floor consideration. sincerely, michael t. mccaul, chairman. ms. kelly of illinois. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this legislation. i appreciate the leadership of senator tom carper in advocating for this bill which would improve the transition process for presidential administrations. when a new president takes office, it can take months for the new administration to put people in place. this bill would ensure that the federal government can continue its important functions during this transition and allow the head of an agency to put career employees in noncareer positions temporarily if necessary. under this legislation, a senior-level interagency transition council would be established to help develop an effective strategy for each presidential transition. the general services administration would also be required to designate a federal transition coordinator, and agencies would be required to designate senior career officials to oversee transition activities. this bill would also help the national archives carry out its mission by authorizing the president to include funds for the archives to efficiently receive records from the outgoing administration. several changes were made to this legislation during consideration by the oversight and government reform committee to address concerns raised by ranking member cummings. for example, the senate version of this bill would have required the office of personnel management to report every quarter on requests for political appointees to convert to career employees. the bill before us today would still require opm to report this information, but it would only be on an annual basis during nonelection years. this bill will help future presidents have a smooth and productive transition. i support this bill, and i have no additional speakers. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. jody b. hice of georgia. mr. speaker, i urge adoption of this bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from georgia (mr. jody b. hice) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 1172, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",30523
CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgH1013,CREC-2016-02-29,114,CALLING ON GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO ASSIST IN CASE OF ROBERT LEVINSON,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1013-H1015] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALLING ON GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO ASSIST IN CASE OF ROBERT LEVINSON Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 148) calling on the Government of Iran to fulfill their promises of assistance in this case of Robert Levinson, the longest held United States civilian in our Nation's history, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 148 Whereas United States citizen Robert Levinson is a retired agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a resident of Coral Springs, Florida, the husband of Christine Levinson, and father of their 7 children; Whereas Robert Levinson traveled from Dubai, UAE, to Kish Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007; Whereas after traveling to Kish Island and checking into the Hotel Maryam, Robert Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007; Whereas, in December 2007, Robert Levinson's wife, Christine, traveled to Kish Island to retrace Mr. Levinson's steps and met with officials of the Government of Iran who pledged to help in the investigation; Whereas, for more than 8 years, the United States Government has continually pressed the Government of Iran to provide any information on the whereabouts of Robert Levinson and to help ensure his prompt and safe return to his family; Whereas officials of the Government of Iran promised their continued assistance to the relatives of Robert Levinson during the visit of the family to the Islamic Republic of Iran in December 2007; Whereas, in November 2010, the Levinson family received a video of Mr. Levinson in captivity, representing the first proof of life since his disappearance and providing some initial indications that he was being held somewhere in southwest Asia; Whereas, in April 2011, the Levinson family received a series of pictures of Mr. Levinson, which provided further indications that he was being held somewhere in southwest Asia; Whereas Secretary John Kerry stated on August 28, 2013, ``The United States respectfully asks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to work cooperatively with us in our efforts to help U.S. citizen Robert Levinson.''; Whereas, on September 28, 2013, during the first direct phone conversation between the heads of the Government of the United States and Iran since 1979, President Barack Obama raised the case of Robert Levinson to President of Iran Hassan Rouhani and urged the President of Iran to help locate Mr. Levinson and reunite him with his family; Whereas, on August 29, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry again stated that the United States ``respectfully request the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran work cooperatively with us to find Mr. Levinson and bring him home.''; Whereas on July 14, 2015, the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany concluded 20 months of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program; Whereas, on January 16, 2016, the Government of Iran released five United States citizens detained in Iran, Jason Rezaian of California, Saeed Abedini of Idaho, Amir Mirzaei Hekmati of Michigan, Matthew Trevithick of Massachusetts, and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari; Whereas, on January 17, 2016, President Obama stated ``even as we rejoice in the safe return of others, we will never forget about Bob'', referring to Robert Levinson, and that ``each and every day but especially today our hearts are with the Levinson family and we [[Page H1014]] will never rest until their family is whole again.''; Whereas, on January 19, 2016, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that the United States Government had ``secured a commitment from the Iranians to use the channel that has now been opened to secure the release of those individuals that we know were being held by Iran. . .to try and gather information about Mr. Levinson's possible whereabouts''; Whereas, on November 26, 2013, Robert Levinson became the longest held United States hostage in our Nation's history; and Whereas the FBI has announced a $5,000,000 reward for information leading to Mr. Levinson's safe return: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) recognizes that Robert Levinson is the longest held United States hostage in our Nation's history; (2) notes the repeated pledges by and renewed commitment of officials of the Government of Iran to provide their Government's assistance in the case of Robert Levinson; (3) urges the Government of Iran, as a humanitarian gesture, to act on its promises to assist in the case of Robert Levinson and to immediately provide to the United States Government all available information from all entities of the Government of Iran regarding the disappearance of Robert Levinson; (4) urges the President and the allies of the United States to continue to raise with officials of the Government of Iran the case of Robert Levinson at every opportunity, notwithstanding ongoing and serious disagreements the United States Government has with the Government of Iran on a broad array of issues, including Iran's ballistic missile program, sponsorship of international terrorism, and human rights abuses; and (5) expresses sympathy to the family of Robert Levinson for their anguish and expresses hope that their ordeal can be brought to an end in the near future. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I would like to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their leadership in bringing attention to Bob Levinson's plight and for guiding this resolution through our Foreign Affairs Committee and onto the House floor today. Two weeks ago, we passed this resolution out of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, which I chair alongside Ranking Member Ted Deutch, my friend from Florida. We were joined by Bob's wife, Christine, and their son Dan, as well as by Bob's sister-in-law, Suzi. It was truly heart wrenching, Mr. Speaker, to see Christine, Dan, and Suzi again and to see how much they miss Bob and how much they worry about his well-being and his fate. All they want is Bob's safe and immediate return. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime's continued failure to honor its commitments and promises to assist in Bob's case and to help bring him home have left them without a father, without a husband, and without a friend for nearly 3,300 days. In fact, next week will mark the ninth anniversary of Bob's disappearance from Kish Island, Iranian territory. I can't even begin to imagine what the family has had to endure for these past 9 years-- all of the birthdays, all of the holidays, all of the anniversaries, all of the momentous family occasions that never really felt whole because Bob was unable to share them with his family. No family should ever have to go through that ordeal, and the U.S. and the Iranian Governments can and should do more to ensure Bob's immediate return. That is why this resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker, is so important, not just for Bob and the Levinson family, but for all American citizens who may, one day, be in a similar situation. Our constituents and the American people need to know that their Representatives and their government will make the safety and security of U.S. citizens a top priority. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of the resolution. I thank my good friend and partner, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, along with Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz and Congressman Diaz-Balart, for introducing this resolution with me and for their commitment to raising awareness to Bob Levinson's case and for always pushing for Bob's return. I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for helping to swiftly move this resolution to the floor as we prepare to mark the anniversary of Bob Levinson's disappearance. I thank Senator Nelson for spearheading a similar resolution, which passed the Senate earlier this month. I also thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. {time} 1700 Passing this resolution today is particularly significant. This Saturday, March 5, 2016, members of Bob's community in my district in south Florida will come together for a rally in support of the Levinson family and call for Bob's immediate return. Just 4 days later, on March 9, we will mark the ninth anniversary of Bob's disappearance from Kish Island in Iran. When we received word in January that our government negotiated for the release of four Americans imprisoned in Iran, we welcomed the news. These were Americans who were wrongfully held, and this move made very clear that the United States does not forget about its own people. We rejoiced as Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Jason Rezaian were reunited with their families. Our colleagues, Congressmen Kildee, Huffman, and Labrador, have been tireless, tireless advocates for the release of their constituents. I am so pleased that each of them has returned to the United States. For their families, Mr. Speaker, the nightmare is over. Unfortunately, the nightmare continues for my constituents, the Levinson family. Bob is now the longest held hostage in American history. Bob has now missed 9 years of birthdays with his seven children, anniversaries with his wife, Christine, weddings, the births of three of his four grandchildren, and so many other happy occasions that should have been celebrated together as a family. This is a family who, for 9 years, has never given up on bringing their husband, their father home. We were so fortunate to be joined by Bob's wife, Christine, and his eldest son, Dan, when we passed this resolution in committee some weeks ago. We had the opportunity to tell them directly that this Congress will not forget about Bob. By passing this resolution today, this House of Representatives will now tell the world that we will never forget about Bob. Bob Levinson dedicated his life to serving this country, first with the DEA and then over 20 years as an FBI agent. Bob is a patriot who loves this country dearly, and now, Mr. Speaker, it is time for this country to come through for Bob. Over the years, the Levinson family has received proof of life in the form of pictures and video. We are grateful that throughout the nuclear negotiations with Iran, Secretary Kerry and others raised Bob's case at every single meeting, and we have been told that the deal to release the other Americans opened new avenues for consultation on Bob's case. But we cannot wait. Whatever information Iran has about Bob needs to be provided now so that Bob can be brought home. This resolution before us today calls on Iran to follow through on its repeated promises of assisting the United States in locating Bob. The resolution calls on our government and those of our partners and allies to continue to press Iran for information about Bob at every opportunity. President Obama and Secretary Kerry have repeatedly expressed their commitment to securing Bob's release, and Secretary Kerry reiterated that commitment during testimony in the House just last week. President Obama has stated in January, when referencing Bob's case, he said ``we will not rest until their family is whole again.'' [[Page H1015]] For anyone who is watching this debate today, I encourage you to share this information about Bob Levinson, to tweet about Bob Levinson, to use the hashtag #whataboutbob. For those in south Florida, I encourage you to come to support the Levinson family this Saturday in Coral Springs. We must keep talking about Bob. We must raise the level of awareness about Bob's case. Our government and the government of our friends and allies must continue to work tirelessly to find Bob and to bring him home. The newly elected Parliament in Iran must know that we will never rest until Bob is home. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on The Middle East and North Africa and chairwoman emeritus of the full committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership on this issue. I also thank Ted Deutch, who authored this very, very important resolution. I also thank Tom Rice and Eliot Engel for quickly bringing this legislation to the floor so that Members can vote on it in anticipation of the ninth anniversary of Bob Levinson's being held by the Iranians. Almost 9 years ago, the Levinson family wrote, in part, on helpboblevinson.com. I quote them, in part. They said: ``If you pray for Bob, we thank you. If you frequently follow the news stories and blogs about Bob's situation, we thank you. If you have spread the word about his story and continue to do so, we thank you. We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. Please continue to pray for Bob. We would love to have him home for Father's Day.'' That was May 25, 2007. That, Mr. Speaker, was almost 9 years ago. In a letter to Dad, also in May of 2007, Bob Levinson's children wrote: ``Dad . . . your seven children love and miss you very much. We are writing you this letter in the hopes that you will be able to read it wherever you are and know that you are in our thoughts and prayers every minute of every day.'' The seven children continued: ``As you know, Mom is our rock. She has encouraged us to take each day one day at a time. While we are sure it will come as no surprise to you, she has amazing strength and has been an inspiration to all seven of us. ``We are all looking forward to your welcome home party. It cannot seem to come soon enough. We pray for you every day and look forward to having you come home to us safe and sound.'' The seven Levinson children continued: ``Dad, you are the best dad anyone could ever ask for, and we love and miss you more than words can say. We are so proud of you, and the world now knows what we have known all along--what an intelligent, kind, and gentle man you are.'' Again, that letter was from Bob's kids, and it was posted almost 9 years ago. Despite the emotional pain, Christine, his wife, and the entire family tenaciously press for Bob Levinson's freedom. No one in American history, as Mr. Deutch pointed out a moment ago, has been held hostage longer than Bob Levinson. His ordeal and the agony and the heartbreak of his family must end. When the reports that most of the Americans held by Iran were released but no freedom or even information about Levinson, the family was indeed crushed. In response, the family wrote: ``We are happy for the other families. But once again, Bob Levinson has been left behind. We are devastated.'' Devastated, yes, but they are absolutely committed to the return of their husband, father, grandfather, relative, and friend. Both the administration and Congress must not rest until this good, decent, and honorable American is returned to his family, friends, and a grateful Nation. So I again thank Representative Ted Deutch for sponsoring H. Res. 148 so all of us can express our deepest concern for Bob Levinson and press, as never before, for his return. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Mr. Smith for his powerful words and for sharing the very powerful and very moving words of Bob's family. I ask my colleagues to think about the Levinson family as if they were your own and to use the opportunity that we have here today to send what is the most powerful message that this House can send--these days especially--and that is a message of unity. Mr. Speaker, with this resolution today, we have an opportunity to recognize that, when a proud American has been missing from his family, has been missing from his community, he is missing from our family and he is missing from our community and our country. Our country is missing Bob Levinson. It is our country that will be made whole when Bob is returned. I urge my colleagues in the strongest way that I can to stand together with me, with Bob's family, and on behalf of every person in this great country in moving this resolution forward and continuing to work tirelessly to bring Bob home. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my good friend, Mr. Deutch, for his eloquent proposals time and time again in our committee, on the House floor, and in every public gathering on behalf of Bob Levinson's family. I am sure that the Levinson family feels a great sense of relief that they have such a tireless advocate by their side. I hope that the administration continues to press the Iranian regime to do more to assist with the Bob Levinson case, and it needs to continue to raise the issue with the Iranian regime at the highest level and at every opportunity. As Mr. Deutch pointed out, the community in south Florida will be rallying in support of Bob and his family this coming Saturday, March 5. It will be held at the Center for the Arts in Coral Springs at 2 in the afternoon. What a powerful message it would send to the family were the House to adopt this resolution without dissent. It will also send a strong message to the Iranian regime that we will not relent until Bob is home with his family and Iran has honored its commitments and its promises. I commend, again, my good friend and south Florida colleague, Ted Deutch, for authoring this resolution, and I am honored to be his Republican lead. I have worked alongside Mr. Deutch for so many years in support of Bob and his family. Bob, a south Florida resident, as you heard, is a constituent of Mr. Deutch's district. As I said, the Levinson family is so fortunate to have such a wonderful Representative, because Ted has shown unwavering commitment to the family, for Bob in his fight to be reunited with his loving family. I can only say that we all support Ted in his mission. We support the Levinson family. We will continue to work with Mr. Deutch in this effort. I urge my colleagues to strongly support this measure, support Bob and the Levinson family in this one more anniversary of being in captivity who knows where. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 148, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. The title of the resolution was amended so as to read: ``A resolution calling on the Government of Iran to follow through on repeated promises of assistance in the case of Robert Levinson, the longest held United States hostage in our Nation's history.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1013-H1015] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALLING ON GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO ASSIST IN CASE OF ROBERT LEVINSON Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 148) calling on the Government of Iran to fulfill their promises of assistance in this case of Robert Levinson, the longest held United States civilian in our Nation's history, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 148 Whereas United States citizen Robert Levinson is a retired agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a resident of Coral Springs, Florida, the husband of Christine Levinson, and father of their 7 children; Whereas Robert Levinson traveled from Dubai, UAE, to Kish Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007; Whereas after traveling to Kish Island and checking into the Hotel Maryam, Robert Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007; Whereas, in December 2007, Robert Levinson's wife, Christine, traveled to Kish Island to retrace Mr. Levinson's steps and met with officials of the Government of Iran who pledged to help in the investigation; Whereas, for more than 8 years, the United States Government has continually pressed the Government of Iran to provide any information on the whereabouts of Robert Levinson and to help ensure his prompt and safe return to his family; Whereas officials of the Government of Iran promised their continued assistance to the relatives of Robert Levinson during the visit of the family to the Islamic Republic of Iran in December 2007; Whereas, in November 2010, the Levinson family received a video of Mr. Levinson in captivity, representing the first proof of life since his disappearance and providing some initial indications that he was being held somewhere in southwest Asia; Whereas, in April 2011, the Levinson family received a series of pictures of Mr. Levinson, which provided further indications that he was being held somewhere in southwest Asia; Whereas Secretary John Kerry stated on August 28, 2013, ``The United States respectfully asks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to work cooperatively with us in our efforts to help U.S. citizen Robert Levinson.''; Whereas, on September 28, 2013, during the first direct phone conversation between the heads of the Government of the United States and Iran since 1979, President Barack Obama raised the case of Robert Levinson to President of Iran Hassan Rouhani and urged the President of Iran to help locate Mr. Levinson and reunite him with his family; Whereas, on August 29, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry again stated that the United States ``respectfully request the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran work cooperatively with us to find Mr. Levinson and bring him home.''; Whereas on July 14, 2015, the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany concluded 20 months of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program; Whereas, on January 16, 2016, the Government of Iran released five United States citizens detained in Iran, Jason Rezaian of California, Saeed Abedini of Idaho, Amir Mirzaei Hekmati of Michigan, Matthew Trevithick of Massachusetts, and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari; Whereas, on January 17, 2016, President Obama stated ``even as we rejoice in the safe return of others, we will never forget about Bob'', referring to Robert Levinson, and that ``each and every day but especially today our hearts are with the Levinson family and we [[Page H1014]] will never rest until their family is whole again.''; Whereas, on January 19, 2016, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that the United States Government had ``secured a commitment from the Iranians to use the channel that has now been opened to secure the release of those individuals that we know were being held by Iran. . .to try and gather information about Mr. Levinson's possible whereabouts''; Whereas, on November 26, 2013, Robert Levinson became the longest held United States hostage in our Nation's history; and Whereas the FBI has announced a $5,000,000 reward for information leading to Mr. Levinson's safe return: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) recognizes that Robert Levinson is the longest held United States hostage in our Nation's history; (2) notes the repeated pledges by and renewed commitment of officials of the Government of Iran to provide their Government's assistance in the case of Robert Levinson; (3) urges the Government of Iran, as a humanitarian gesture, to act on its promises to assist in the case of Robert Levinson and to immediately provide to the United States Government all available information from all entities of the Government of Iran regarding the disappearance of Robert Levinson; (4) urges the President and the allies of the United States to continue to raise with officials of the Government of Iran the case of Robert Levinson at every opportunity, notwithstanding ongoing and serious disagreements the United States Government has with the Government of Iran on a broad array of issues, including Iran's ballistic missile program, sponsorship of international terrorism, and human rights abuses; and (5) expresses sympathy to the family of Robert Levinson for their anguish and expresses hope that their ordeal can be brought to an end in the near future. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I would like to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their leadership in bringing attention to Bob Levinson's plight and for guiding this resolution through our Foreign Affairs Committee and onto the House floor today. Two weeks ago, we passed this resolution out of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, which I chair alongside Ranking Member Ted Deutch, my friend from Florida. We were joined by Bob's wife, Christine, and their son Dan, as well as by Bob's sister-in-law, Suzi. It was truly heart wrenching, Mr. Speaker, to see Christine, Dan, and Suzi again and to see how much they miss Bob and how much they worry about his well-being and his fate. All they want is Bob's safe and immediate return. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime's continued failure to honor its commitments and promises to assist in Bob's case and to help bring him home have left them without a father, without a husband, and without a friend for nearly 3,300 days. In fact, next week will mark the ninth anniversary of Bob's disappearance from Kish Island, Iranian territory. I can't even begin to imagine what the family has had to endure for these past 9 years-- all of the birthdays, all of the holidays, all of the anniversaries, all of the momentous family occasions that never really felt whole because Bob was unable to share them with his family. No family should ever have to go through that ordeal, and the U.S. and the Iranian Governments can and should do more to ensure Bob's immediate return. That is why this resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker, is so important, not just for Bob and the Levinson family, but for all American citizens who may, one day, be in a similar situation. Our constituents and the American people need to know that their Representatives and their government will make the safety and security of U.S. citizens a top priority. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of the resolution. I thank my good friend and partner, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, along with Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz and Congressman Diaz-Balart, for introducing this resolution with me and for their commitment to raising awareness to Bob Levinson's case and for always pushing for Bob's return. I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for helping to swiftly move this resolution to the floor as we prepare to mark the anniversary of Bob Levinson's disappearance. I thank Senator Nelson for spearheading a similar resolution, which passed the Senate earlier this month. I also thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. {time} 1700 Passing this resolution today is particularly significant. This Saturday, March 5, 2016, members of Bob's community in my district in south Florida will come together for a rally in support of the Levinson family and call for Bob's immediate return. Just 4 days later, on March 9, we will mark the ninth anniversary of Bob's disappearance from Kish Island in Iran. When we received word in January that our government negotiated for the release of four Americans imprisoned in Iran, we welcomed the news. These were Americans who were wrongfully held, and this move made very clear that the United States does not forget about its own people. We rejoiced as Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Jason Rezaian were reunited with their families. Our colleagues, Congressmen Kildee, Huffman, and Labrador, have been tireless, tireless advocates for the release of their constituents. I am so pleased that each of them has returned to the United States. For their families, Mr. Speaker, the nightmare is over. Unfortunately, the nightmare continues for my constituents, the Levinson family. Bob is now the longest held hostage in American history. Bob has now missed 9 years of birthdays with his seven children, anniversaries with his wife, Christine, weddings, the births of three of his four grandchildren, and so many other happy occasions that should have been celebrated together as a family. This is a family who, for 9 years, has never given up on bringing their husband, their father home. We were so fortunate to be joined by Bob's wife, Christine, and his eldest son, Dan, when we passed this resolution in committee some weeks ago. We had the opportunity to tell them directly that this Congress will not forget about Bob. By passing this resolution today, this House of Representatives will now tell the world that we will never forget about Bob. Bob Levinson dedicated his life to serving this country, first with the DEA and then over 20 years as an FBI agent. Bob is a patriot who loves this country dearly, and now, Mr. Speaker, it is time for this country to come through for Bob. Over the years, the Levinson family has received proof of life in the form of pictures and video. We are grateful that throughout the nuclear negotiations with Iran, Secretary Kerry and others raised Bob's case at every single meeting, and we have been told that the deal to release the other Americans opened new avenues for consultation on Bob's case. But we cannot wait. Whatever information Iran has about Bob needs to be provided now so that Bob can be brought home. This resolution before us today calls on Iran to follow through on its repeated promises of assisting the United States in locating Bob. The resolution calls on our government and those of our partners and allies to continue to press Iran for information about Bob at every opportunity. President Obama and Secretary Kerry have repeatedly expressed their commitment to securing Bob's release, and Secretary Kerry reiterated that commitment during testimony in the House just last week. President Obama has stated in January, when referencing Bob's case, he said ``we will not rest until their family is whole again.'' [[Page H1015]] For anyone who is watching this debate today, I encourage you to share this information about Bob Levinson, to tweet about Bob Levinson, to use the hashtag #whataboutbob. For those in south Florida, I encourage you to come to support the Levinson family this Saturday in Coral Springs. We must keep talking about Bob. We must raise the level of awareness about Bob's case. Our government and the government of our friends and allies must continue to work tirelessly to find Bob and to bring him home. The newly elected Parliament in Iran must know that we will never rest until Bob is home. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on The Middle East and North Africa and chairwoman emeritus of the full committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership on this issue. I also thank Ted Deutch, who authored this very, very important resolution. I also thank Tom Rice and Eliot Engel for quickly bringing this legislation to the floor so that Members can vote on it in anticipation of the ninth anniversary of Bob Levinson's being held by the Iranians. Almost 9 years ago, the Levinson family wrote, in part, on helpboblevinson.com. I quote them, in part. They said: ``If you pray for Bob, we thank you. If you frequently follow the news stories and blogs about Bob's situation, we thank you. If you have spread the word about his story and continue to do so, we thank you. We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. Please continue to pray for Bob. We would love to have him home for Father's Day.'' That was May 25, 2007. That, Mr. Speaker, was almost 9 years ago. In a letter to Dad, also in May of 2007, Bob Levinson's children wrote: ``Dad . . . your seven children love and miss you very much. We are writing you this letter in the hopes that you will be able to read it wherever you are and know that you are in our thoughts and prayers every minute of every day.'' The seven children continued: ``As you know, Mom is our rock. She has encouraged us to take each day one day at a time. While we are sure it will come as no surprise to you, she has amazing strength and has been an inspiration to all seven of us. ``We are all looking forward to your welcome home party. It cannot seem to come soon enough. We pray for you every day and look forward to having you come home to us safe and sound.'' The seven Levinson children continued: ``Dad, you are the best dad anyone could ever ask for, and we love and miss you more than words can say. We are so proud of you, and the world now knows what we have known all along--what an intelligent, kind, and gentle man you are.'' Again, that letter was from Bob's kids, and it was posted almost 9 years ago. Despite the emotional pain, Christine, his wife, and the entire family tenaciously press for Bob Levinson's freedom. No one in American history, as Mr. Deutch pointed out a moment ago, has been held hostage longer than Bob Levinson. His ordeal and the agony and the heartbreak of his family must end. When the reports that most of the Americans held by Iran were released but no freedom or even information about Levinson, the family was indeed crushed. In response, the family wrote: ``We are happy for the other families. But once again, Bob Levinson has been left behind. We are devastated.'' Devastated, yes, but they are absolutely committed to the return of their husband, father, grandfather, relative, and friend. Both the administration and Congress must not rest until this good, decent, and honorable American is returned to his family, friends, and a grateful Nation. So I again thank Representative Ted Deutch for sponsoring H. Res. 148 so all of us can express our deepest concern for Bob Levinson and press, as never before, for his return. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Mr. Smith for his powerful words and for sharing the very powerful and very moving words of Bob's family.

Our country is missing Bob Levinson. It is our country that will be made whole when Bob is returned. I urge my colleagues in the strongest way that I can to stand together with me, with Bob's family, and on behalf of every person in this great country in moving this resolution forward and continuing to work tirelessly to bring Bob home. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

[[Page H1015]] For anyone who is watching this debate today, I encourage you to share this information about Bob Levinson, to tweet about Bob Levinson, to use the hashtag #whataboutbob. For those in south Florida, I encourage you to come to support the Levinson family this Saturday in Coral Springs. We must keep talking about Bob. We must raise the level of awareness about Bob's case. Our government and the government of our friends and allies must continue to work tirelessly to find Bob and to bring him home. The newly elected Parliament in Iran must know that we will never rest until Bob is home. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on The Middle East and North Africa and chairwoman emeritus of the full committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership on this issue. I also thank Ted Deutch, who authored this very, very important resolution. I also thank Tom Rice and Eliot Engel for quickly bringing this legislation to the floor so that Members can vote on it in anticipation of the ninth anniversary of Bob Levinson's being held by the Iranians. Almost 9 years ago, the Levinson family wrote, in part, on helpboblevinson.com. I quote them, in part. They said: ``If you pray for Bob, we thank you. If you frequently follow the news stories and blogs about Bob's situation, we thank you. If you have spread the word about his story and continue to do so, we thank you. We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. Please continue to pray for Bob. We would love to have him home for Father's Day.'' That was May 25, 2007. That, Mr. Speaker, was almost 9 years ago. In a letter to Dad, also in May of 2007, Bob Levinson's children wrote: ``Dad . . . your seven children love and miss you very much. We are writing you this letter in the hopes that you will be able to read it wherever you are and know that you are in our thoughts and prayers every minute of every day.'' The seven children continued: ``As you know, Mom is our rock. She has encouraged us to take each day one day at a time. While we are sure it will come as no surprise to you, she has amazing strength and has been an inspiration to all seven of us. ``We are all looking forward to your welcome home party. It cannot seem to come soon enough. We pray for you every day and look forward to having you come home to us safe and sound.'' The seven Levinson children continued: ``Dad, you are the best dad anyone could ever ask for, and we love and miss you more than words can say. We are so proud of you, and the world now knows what we have known all along--what an intelligent, kind, and gentle man you are.'' Again, that letter was from Bob's kids, and it was posted almost 9 years ago. Despite the emotional pain, Christine, his wife, and the entire family tenaciously press for Bob Levinson's freedom. No one in American history, as Mr. Deutch pointed out a moment ago, has been held hostage longer than Bob Levinson. His ordeal and the agony and the heartbreak of his family must end. When the reports that most of the Americans held by Iran were released but no freedom or even information about Levinson, the family was indeed crushed. In response, the family wrote: ``We are happy for the other families. But once again, Bob Levinson has been left behind. We are devastated.'' Devastated, yes, but they are absolutely committed to the return of their husband, father, grandfather, relative, and friend. Both the administration and Congress must not rest until this good, decent, and honorable American is returned to his family, friends, and a grateful Nation. So I again thank Representative Ted Deutch for sponsoring H. Res. 148 so all of us can express our deepest concern for Bob Levinson and press, as never before, for his return. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank Mr. Smith for his powerful words and for sharing the very powerful and very moving words of Bob's family. I ask my colleagues to think about the Levinson family as if they were your own and to use the opportunity that we have here today to send what is the most powerful message that this House can send--these days especially--and that is a message of unity. Mr. Speaker, with this resolution today, we have an opportunity to recognize that, when a proud American has been missing from his family, has been missing from his community, he is missing from our family and he is missing from our community and our country. Our country is missing Bob Levinson. It is our country that will be made whole when Bob is returned. I urge my colleagues in the strongest way that I can to stand together with me, with Bob's family, and on behalf of every person in this great country in moving this resolution forward and continuing to work tirelessly to bring Bob home. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my good friend, Mr. Deutch, for his eloquent proposals time and time again in our committee, on the House floor, and in every public gathering on behalf of Bob Levinson's family. I am sure that the Levinson family feels a great sense of relief that they have such a tireless advocate by their side. I hope that the administration continues to press the Iranian regime to do more to assist with the Bob Levinson case, and it needs to continue to raise the issue with the Iranian regime at the highest level and at every opportunity. As Mr. Deutch pointed out, the community in south Florida will be rallying in support of Bob and his family this coming Saturday, March 5. It will be held at the Center for the Arts in Coral Springs at 2 in the afternoon. What a powerful message it would send to the family were the House to adopt this resolution without dissent. It will also send a strong message to the Iranian regime that we will not relent until Bob is home with his family and Iran has honored its commitments and its promises. I commend, again, my good friend and south Florida colleague, Ted Deutch, for authoring this resolution, and I am honored to be his Republican lead. I have worked alongside Mr. Deutch for so many years in support of Bob and his family. Bob, a south Florida resident, as you heard, is a constituent of Mr. Deutch's district. As I said, the Levinson family is so fortunate to have such a wonderful Representative, because Ted has shown unwavering commitment to the family, for Bob in his fight to be reunited with his loving family. I can only say that we all support Ted in his mission. We support the Levinson family. We will continue to work with Mr. Deutch in this effort. I urge my colleagues to strongly support this measure, support Bob and the Levinson family in this one more anniversary of being in captivity who knows where. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 148, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. The title of the resolution was amended so as to read: ``A resolution calling on the Government of Iran to follow through on repeated promises of assistance in the case of Robert Levinson, the longest held United States hostage in our Nation's history.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,19786,19786,19856,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [house] [pages h1013-h1015] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] calling on government of iran to assist in case of robert levinson ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (h. res. 148) calling on the government of iran to fulfill their promises of assistance in this case of robert levinson, the longest held united states civilian in our nation's history, as amended. the clerk read the title of the resolution. the text of the resolution is as follows: h. res. 148 whereas united states citizen robert levinson is a retired agent of the federal bureau of investigation (fbi), a resident of coral springs, florida, the husband of christine levinson, and father of their 7 children; whereas robert levinson traveled from dubai, uae, to kish island, iran, on march 8, 2007; whereas after traveling to kish island and checking into the hotel maryam, robert levinson disappeared on march 9, 2007; whereas, in december 2007, robert levinson's wife, christine, traveled to kish island to retrace mr. levinson's steps and met with officials of the government of iran who pledged to help in the investigation; whereas, for more than 8 years, the united states government has continually pressed the government of iran to provide any information on the whereabouts of robert levinson and to help ensure his prompt and safe return to his family; whereas officials of the government of iran promised their continued assistance to the relatives of robert levinson during the visit of the family to the islamic republic of iran in december 2007; whereas, in november 2010, the levinson family received a video of mr. levinson in captivity, representing the first proof of life since his disappearance and providing some initial indications that he was being held somewhere in southwest asia; whereas, in april 2011, the levinson family received a series of pictures of mr. levinson, which provided further indications that he was being held somewhere in southwest asia; whereas secretary john kerry stated on august 28, 2013, ``the united states respectfully asks the government of the islamic republic of iran to work cooperatively with us in our efforts to help u.s. citizen robert levinson.''; whereas, on september 28, 2013, during the first direct phone conversation between the heads of the government of the united states and iran since 1979, president barack obama raised the case of robert levinson to president of iran hassan rouhani and urged the president of iran to help locate mr. levinson and reunite him with his family; whereas, on august 29, 2014, secretary of state john kerry again stated that the united states ``respectfully request the government of the islamic republic of iran work cooperatively with us to find mr. levinson and bring him home.''; whereas on july 14, 2015, the governments of the united states, the united kingdom, france, russia, china, and germany concluded 20 months of negotiations with iran over its nuclear program; whereas, on january 16, 2016, the government of iran released five united states citizens detained in iran, jason rezaian of california, saeed abedini of idaho, amir mirzaei hekmati of michigan, matthew trevithick of massachusetts, and nosratollah khosravi-roodsari; whereas, on january 17, 2016, president obama stated ``even as we rejoice in the safe return of others, we will never forget about bob'', referring to robert levinson, and that ``each and every day but especially today our hearts are with the levinson family and we [[page h1014]] will never rest until their family is whole again.''; whereas, on january 19, 2016, white house press secretary josh earnest stated that the united states government had ``secured a commitment from the iranians to use the channel that has now been opened to secure the release of those individuals that we know were being held by iran. . .to try and gather information about mr. levinson's possible whereabouts''; whereas, on november 26, 2013, robert levinson became the longest held united states hostage in our nation's history; and whereas the fbi has announced a $5,000,000 reward for information leading to mr. levinson's safe return: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the house of representatives-- (1) recognizes that robert levinson is the longest held united states hostage in our nation's history; (2) notes the repeated pledges by and renewed commitment of officials of the government of iran to provide their government's assistance in the case of robert levinson; (3) urges the government of iran, as a humanitarian gesture, to act on its promises to assist in the case of robert levinson and to immediately provide to the united states government all available information from all entities of the government of iran regarding the disappearance of robert levinson; (4) urges the president and the allies of the united states to continue to raise with officials of the government of iran the case of robert levinson at every opportunity, notwithstanding ongoing and serious disagreements the united states government has with the government of iran on a broad array of issues, including iran's ballistic missile program, sponsorship of international terrorism, and human rights abuses; and (5) expresses sympathy to the family of robert levinson for their anguish and expresses hope that their ordeal can be brought to an end in the near future. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) and the gentleman from florida (mr. deutch) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from florida. general leave ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from florida? there was no objection. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. first, i would like to thank chairman royce and ranking member engel for their leadership in bringing attention to bob levinson's plight and for guiding this resolution through our foreign affairs committee and onto the house floor today. two weeks ago, we passed this resolution out of the middle east and north africa subcommittee, which i chair alongside ranking member ted deutch, my friend from florida. we were joined by bob's wife, christine, and their son dan, as well as by bob's sister-in-law, suzi. it was truly heart wrenching, mr. speaker, to see christine, dan, and suzi again and to see how much they miss bob and how much they worry about his well-being and his fate. all they want is bob's safe and immediate return. unfortunately, the iranian regime's continued failure to honor its commitments and promises to assist in bob's case and to help bring him home have left them without a father, without a husband, and without a friend for nearly 3,300 days. in fact, next week will mark the ninth anniversary of bob's disappearance from kish island, iranian territory. i can't even begin to imagine what the family has had to endure for these past 9 years-- all of the birthdays, all of the holidays, all of the anniversaries, all of the momentous family occasions that never really felt whole because bob was unable to share them with his family. no family should ever have to go through that ordeal, and the u.s. and the iranian governments can and should do more to ensure bob's immediate return. that is why this resolution before us today, mr. speaker, is so important, not just for bob and the levinson family, but for all american citizens who may, one day, be in a similar situation. our constituents and the american people need to know that their representatives and their government will make the safety and security of u.s. citizens a top priority. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. deutch. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of the resolution. i thank my good friend and partner, congresswoman ros-lehtinen, along with congresswoman wasserman schultz and congressman diaz-balart, for introducing this resolution with me and for their commitment to raising awareness to bob levinson's case and for always pushing for bob's return. i thank chairman royce and ranking member engel for helping to swiftly move this resolution to the floor as we prepare to mark the anniversary of bob levinson's disappearance. i thank senator nelson for spearheading a similar resolution, which passed the senate earlier this month. i also thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. {time} 1700 passing this resolution today is particularly significant. this saturday, march 5, 2016, members of bob's community in my district in south florida will come together for a rally in support of the levinson family and call for bob's immediate return. just 4 days later, on march 9, we will mark the ninth anniversary of bob's disappearance from kish island in iran. when we received word in january that our government negotiated for the release of four americans imprisoned in iran, we welcomed the news. these were americans who were wrongfully held, and this move made very clear that the united states does not forget about its own people. we rejoiced as amir hekmati, saeed abedini, and jason rezaian were reunited with their families. our colleagues, congressmen kildee, huffman, and labrador, have been tireless, tireless advocates for the release of their constituents. i am so pleased that each of them has returned to the united states. for their families, mr. speaker, the nightmare is over. unfortunately, the nightmare continues for my constituents, the levinson family. bob is now the longest held hostage in american history. bob has now missed 9 years of birthdays with his seven children, anniversaries with his wife, christine, weddings, the births of three of his four grandchildren, and so many other happy occasions that should have been celebrated together as a family. this is a family who, for 9 years, has never given up on bringing their husband, their father home. we were so fortunate to be joined by bob's wife, christine, and his eldest son, dan, when we passed this resolution in committee some weeks ago. we had the opportunity to tell them directly that this congress will not forget about bob. by passing this resolution today, this house of representatives will now tell the world that we will never forget about bob. bob levinson dedicated his life to serving this country, first with the dea and then over 20 years as an fbi agent. bob is a patriot who loves this country dearly, and now, mr. speaker, it is time for this country to come through for bob. over the years, the levinson family has received proof of life in the form of pictures and video. we are grateful that throughout the nuclear negotiations with iran, secretary kerry and others raised bob's case at every single meeting, and we have been told that the deal to release the other americans opened new avenues for consultation on bob's case. but we cannot wait. whatever information iran has about bob needs to be provided now so that bob can be brought home. this resolution before us today calls on iran to follow through on its repeated promises of assisting the united states in locating bob. the resolution calls on our government and those of our partners and allies to continue to press iran for information about bob at every opportunity. president obama and secretary kerry have repeatedly expressed their commitment to securing bob's release, and secretary kerry reiterated that commitment during testimony in the house just last week. president obama has stated in january, when referencing bob's case, he said ``we will not rest until their family is whole again.'' [[page h1015]] for anyone who is watching this debate today, i encourage you to share this information about bob levinson, to tweet about bob levinson, to use the hashtag #whataboutbob. for those in south florida, i encourage you to come to support the levinson family this saturday in coral springs. we must keep talking about bob. we must raise the level of awareness about bob's case. our government and the government of our friends and allies must continue to work tirelessly to find bob and to bring him home. the newly elected parliament in iran must know that we will never rest until bob is home. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith), who is the chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on africa, global health, global human rights, and international organizations. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i thank the chairwoman of the subcommittee on the middle east and north africa and chairwoman emeritus of the full committee, ileana ros-lehtinen, for her leadership on this issue. i also thank ted deutch, who authored this very, very important resolution. i also thank tom rice and eliot engel for quickly bringing this legislation to the floor so that members can vote on it in anticipation of the ninth anniversary of bob levinson's being held by the iranians.

bob. we would love to have him home for father's day.'' that was may 25, 2007. that, mr. speaker, was almost 9 years ago. in a letter to dad, also in may of 2007, bob levinson's children wrote: ``dad . . . your seven children love and miss you very much. we are writing you this letter in the hopes that you will be able to read it wherever you are and know that you are in our thoughts and prayers

this good, decent, and honorable american is returned to his family, friends, and a grateful nation. so i again thank representative ted deutch for sponsoring h. res. 148 so all of us can express our

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. {time} 1615 Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that we are considering today H.R. 4583, a bill to promote a 21st century energy and manufacturing workforce, introduced by my colleagues, Mr. Rush of Illinois and Mr. Hudson of North Carolina. This bill takes important steps to help make training for energy and manufacturing jobs available to women and minorities as well as veterans and out-of-work coal miners. I want to give a special word of thanks to Mr. Rush because he and Mr. Hudson were working on this legislation. They tried to get it included in the energy act that we passed a few weeks ago, and it didn't quite work out; but I am delighted that we are able to move this bill by itself. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by commending Chairman Upton, Chairman Whitfield, Ranking Member Pallone, and the committee staff for working with my office to bring the 21st century workforce legislation to the House floor today. I would also publicly acknowledge the leadership of my colleague, Mr. Hudson of North Carolina, and his staff who played an instrumental role in helping us to get to this very point. The good faith talks held between my office, the majority and the minority committee staff, and Mr. Hudson's office have resulted in this bipartisan jobs bill that will go a long way in helping to get our Nation's economy back on track and working for everyone. Mr. Speaker, this workforce bill before us provides an example of how Congress should function and how Congress should work on behalf of the American people. Here we have bipartisan members of the Energy and Commerce Committee who represent various constituencies from diverse regions of the country and who come from different political persuasions. However, Mr. Speaker, it must be well noted that we were able to put aside our differences and focus our efforts on bringing forth a jobs bill that will benefit all of our Nation's communities and help lift up the entire American economy. And exactly what does this bill do, Mr. Speaker? This bill directs the Secretary of Energy to prioritize the training of underrepresented groups, including minorities, women, veterans, as well as displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers, in order to increase the number of skilled candidates trained to work in these same related fields. Mr. Speaker, this bill will strengthen and more fully engage DOE programs and national laboratories in order to carry out the Department's workforce development initiatives. That includes the Minorities in Energy Initiative that was established 2 years ago, with my encouragement, under Secretary Moniz's leadership. There will be a clearinghouse of information and resources on training and workforce development programs for energy and manufacturing-related jobs, State by State and region by region all across our Nation. Mr. Speaker, this bill will help increase outreach to minority- serving institutions to ensure that the wealth of existing resources at DOE are made available to these worthy establishments. It will also provide additional outreach to displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers with the objective of improving the opportunities for these candidates to find employment. [[Page H1010]] This legislation, Mr. Speaker, will help to develop a skilled labor force, trained to work in a wide array of sectors, including renewables, energy efficiency, oil and gas, coal, nuclear, utility, pipelines, alternative fuels, as well as energy-intensive and advanced manufacturing industries. Mr. Speaker, one of the challenges that I have heard far too many times from my constituents is of individuals participating in training programs that in many cases do not always lead to actually finding a job. With that in mind, Mr. Speaker, this bill will help industry, help schools, and help community-based workforce development organizations to identify candidates for enrollment into training and apprenticeship programs, with the objective of ensuring that the skills learned are immediately transferable to good-paying jobs and good-paying careers within the energy and manufacturing sectors regionally, nationally, and, indeed, all across this globe. Mr. Speaker, as you well know, and as all Members in this House know, the energy and manufacturing industries are two of the most critical and fastest growing sectors both domestically as well as internationally. The potential of these two sectors can help bolster the American economy and are also vital to the growing number of people seeking middle class status all across the developing world. It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we equip our citizens, those who need jobs and those who are out of work, with the skills needed and necessary to meet this growing demand so that we can tap into these tremendous opportunities. This very bill before us today will accomplish that goal. Why is the 21st century workforce bill so very necessary? Mr. Speaker, just last week, my office had yet another visiting delegation, a meeting this time with an energy company out of the great State of North Carolina, whose representatives informed me that right now, today, as we stand here in this great Chamber today, they have over 1,000 job openings that they cannot fill because they cannot find enough qualified skilled workers. The 21st century workforce bill will address that difficulty and be a solution to that and many other similar problems all across our country. In fact, Mr. Speaker, my office has been holding many of these same types of meetings over the past 4 years with a variety of different energy and manufacturing industries that are indeed facing this very same predicament. At a time when African American and Latino unemployment rates are still too high, when coal workers throughout Appalachia and beyond are finding themselves without work, when too many female heads of household cannot find adequate employment to take care of their families, and when veterans returning home from defending our Nation still cannot find a job, it is a travesty and a shame that eager employers still cannot find the trained workers they need. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense jobs bill that will help to match up trained, qualified candidates with good-paying jobs and careers that will fit them and their families, help lift up their community, help strengthen the energy and manufacturing industry, and will bolster the entire American economy as a whole. Whether you are a student pursuing your engineering degree at an HBCU or a single mother taking classes at your neighborhood community college, this bill seeks to provide additional opportunity to all those individuals who are out there looking to better themselves and improve the financial situation for their families. Mr. Speaker, when this bill becomes law and its provisions are implemented, it will help out-of-work coal miners retool and retrain for the jobs of the 21st century. This bill will also help returning veterans use their skills and use their talents to find employment and provide a dignified future for their families. So, Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from the great State of Michigan, Chairman Upton; my friend from the great State of Kentucky, Chairman Whitfield; Ranking Member Pallone; my friend from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson); and all my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as those who are on the Education and the Workforce Committee who helped bring us to this point today, where we are bringing forward this bill with this focus not only on underserved communities, such as minorities, women, and veterans, but also displaced and unemployed coal miners and out-of-work energy workers in other places. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, when this bill ultimately becomes law, it will go a long way in helping not only communities that look like the one I represent on the south side of Chicago, but every community in every district throughout this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to reiterate once again that there were a lot of people involved in bringing this legislation to the floor. It would not have happened except for the persistence and commitment of Mr. Rush of Illinois. So I want to thank him again. I also want to say that every Member of Congress comes to this floor, and we talk about regulations and the impact they have on creating jobs. We talk about uncertainty in tax policies, and we talk about the ability of America to be competitive in the global workplace. We talk about a lot of macro issues. But for men and women out there in the country, like coal miners who are losing jobs because of the policies of this administration, veterans who have extensive leadership skills but can't find good jobs, and minorities who are not trained in the right way, this legislation goes a long way in providing the training that people need to find a good job. I urge all Members to support this legislation. I want to thank everyone who worked for it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1630 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4583, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1008-H1010] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT Mr. WHITFIELD.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. {time} 1615 Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that we are considering today H.R. 4583, a bill to promote a 21st century energy and manufacturing workforce, introduced by my colleagues, Mr. Rush of Illinois and Mr. Hudson of North Carolina. This bill takes important steps to help make training for energy and manufacturing jobs available to women and minorities as well as veterans and out-of-work coal miners. I want to give a special word of thanks to Mr. Rush because he and Mr. Hudson were working on this legislation. They tried to get it included in the energy act that we passed a few weeks ago, and it didn't quite work out; but I am delighted that we are able to move this bill by itself. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by commending Chairman Upton, Chairman Whitfield, Ranking Member Pallone, and the committee staff for working with my office to bring the 21st century workforce legislation to the House floor today. I would also publicly acknowledge the leadership of my colleague, Mr. Hudson of North Carolina, and his staff who played an instrumental role in helping us to get to this very point. The good faith talks held between my office, the majority and the minority committee staff, and Mr. Hudson's office have resulted in this bipartisan jobs bill that will go a long way in helping to get our Nation's economy back on track and working for everyone. Mr. Speaker, this workforce bill before us provides an example of how Congress should function and how Congress should work on behalf of the American people. Here we have bipartisan members of the Energy and Commerce Committee who represent various constituencies from diverse regions of the country and who come from different political persuasions. However, Mr. Speaker, it must be well noted that we were able to put aside our differences and focus our efforts on bringing forth a jobs bill that will benefit all of our Nation's communities and help lift up the entire American economy. And exactly what does this bill do, Mr. Speaker? This bill directs the Secretary of Energy to prioritize the training of underrepresented groups, including minorities, women, veterans, as well as displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers, in order to increase the number of skilled candidates trained to work in these same related fields. Mr. Speaker, this bill will strengthen and more fully engage DOE programs and national laboratories in order to carry out the Department's workforce development initiatives. That includes the Minorities in Energy Initiative that was established 2 years ago, with my encouragement, under Secretary Moniz's leadership. There will be a clearinghouse of information and resources on training and workforce development programs for energy and manufacturing-related jobs, State by State and region by region all across our Nation. Mr. Speaker, this bill will help increase outreach to minority- serving institutions to ensure that the wealth of existing resources at DOE are made available to these worthy establishments. It will also provide additional outreach to displaced and unemployed energy and manufacturing workers with the objective of improving the opportunities for these candidates to find employment. [[Page H1010]] This legislation, Mr. Speaker, will help to develop a skilled labor force, trained to work in a wide array of sectors, including renewables, energy efficiency, oil and gas, coal, nuclear, utility, pipelines, alternative fuels, as well as energy-intensive and advanced manufacturing industries. Mr. Speaker, one of the challenges that I have heard far too many times from my constituents is of individuals participating in training programs that in many cases do not always lead to actually finding a job. With that in mind, Mr. Speaker, this bill will help industry, help schools, and help community-based workforce development organizations to identify candidates for enrollment into training and apprenticeship programs, with the objective of ensuring that the skills learned are immediately transferable to good-paying jobs and good-paying careers within the energy and manufacturing sectors regionally, nationally, and, indeed, all across this globe. Mr. Speaker, as you well know, and as all Members in this House know, the energy and manufacturing industries are two of the most critical and fastest growing sectors both domestically as well as internationally. The potential of these two sectors can help bolster the American economy and are also vital to the growing number of people seeking middle class status all across the developing world. It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we equip our citizens, those who need jobs and those who are out of work, with the skills needed and necessary to meet this growing demand so that we can tap into these tremendous opportunities. This very bill before us today will accomplish that goal. Why is the 21st century workforce bill so very necessary? Mr. Speaker, just last week, my office had yet another visiting delegation, a meeting this time with an energy company out of the great State of North Carolina, whose representatives informed me that right now, today, as we stand here in this great Chamber today, they have over 1,000 job openings that they cannot fill because they cannot find enough qualified skilled workers. The 21st century workforce bill will address that difficulty and be a solution to that and many other similar problems all across our country. In fact, Mr. Speaker, my office has been holding many of these same types of meetings over the past 4 years with a variety of different energy and manufacturing industries that are indeed facing this very same predicament. At a time when African American and Latino unemployment rates are still too high, when coal workers throughout Appalachia and beyond are finding themselves without work, when too many female heads of household cannot find adequate employment to take care of their families, and when veterans returning home from defending our Nation still cannot find a job, it is a travesty and a shame that eager employers still cannot find the trained workers they need. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense jobs bill that will help to match up trained, qualified candidates with good-paying jobs and careers that will fit them and their families, help lift up their community, help strengthen the energy and manufacturing industry, and will bolster the entire American economy as a whole. Whether you are a student pursuing your engineering degree at an HBCU or a single mother taking classes at your neighborhood community college, this bill seeks to provide additional opportunity to all those individuals who are out there looking to better themselves and improve the financial situation for their families. Mr. Speaker, when this bill becomes law and its provisions are implemented, it will help out-of-work coal miners retool and retrain for the jobs of the 21st century. This bill will also help returning veterans use their skills and use their talents to find employment and provide a dignified future for their families. So, Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from the great State of Michigan, Chairman Upton; my friend from the great State of Kentucky, Chairman Whitfield; Ranking Member Pallone; my friend from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson); and all my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as those who are on the Education and the Workforce Committee who helped bring us to this point today, where we are bringing forward this bill with this focus not only on underserved communities, such as minorities, women, and veterans, but also displaced and unemployed coal miners and out-of-work energy workers in other places. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, when this bill ultimately becomes law, it will go a long way in helping not only communities that look like the one I represent on the south side of Chicago, but every community in every district throughout this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to reiterate once again that there were a lot of people involved in bringing this legislation to the floor. It would not have happened except for the persistence and commitment of Mr. Rush of Illinois. So I want to thank him again. I also want to say that every Member of Congress comes to this floor, and we talk about regulations and the impact they have on creating jobs. We talk about uncertainty in tax policies, and we talk about the ability of America to be competitive in the global workplace. We talk about a lot of macro issues. But for men and women out there in the country, like coal miners who are losing jobs because of the policies of this administration, veterans who have extensive leadership skills but can't find good jobs, and minorities who are not trained in the right way, this legislation goes a long way in providing the training that people need to find a good job. I urge all Members to support this legislation. I want to thank everyone who worked for it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1630 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4583, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,21567,21567,21637,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [house] [pages h1008-h1010] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy and manufacturing workforce development mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 4583) to promote a 21st century energy and manufacturing workforce, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 4583 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. energy and manufacturing workforce development.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Just 3 short years ago, a group of domestic terrorists were plotting attacks in my hometown in northwest Georgia. Federal law enforcement was informed that these terrorists were trying to obtain pipe bombs and other improvised explosive devices. Once detonated, these weapons could have destroyed property, disabled utilities, and potentially taken innocent human life. Because of the imminent threat, a Federal drug task force had to move quickly to intercept the suspects before they could carry out their attack. With such a short time to react to such a volatile situation, logic would suggest that Federal law enforcement would notify and enlist the assistance of the local sheriff's office. Considering the raid was to take place in the parking lot of a busy shopping center adjacent to a hospital, having local law enforcement assistance was clearly justified. However, there was one problem. The sheriff didn't have the proper security clearance; so, he was not authorized to be briefed on the details of the case. To stop these would-be terrorists, the FBI had to move quickly and could not wait for a waiver to brief the sheriff or to get approval to enlist his assistance. This bureaucratic hurdle put the FBI, our local law enforcement, and the community at greater risk. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this scenario plays out way too often across the Nation. While our FBI and Homeland Security agents are doing an exemplary job of countering terrorist activities, their resources are being stretched very thin. With the threat of terrorism on the rise, we must find a way to provide these agents with additional resources. This is why I have introduced H.R. 4401, the ALERT Act. The Amplifying Local Efforts to Root Out Terror Act removes bureaucratic barriers and paves the way for the Federal Government to enhance State and local law enforcement involvement in fighting the war on terrorism. By providing the tools and training needed to combat terrorism on multiple levels, this act will provide more efficient cooperation and coordination with State and local officials. Local law enforcement is crucial to our security, and they are too often overlooked as a valuable asset in fighting against terrorism. Through this legislation, the Department of Homeland Security will be authorized to train State and local law enforcement in the best methods used in combating evolving terrorist threats. Proper security clearances are also vital for our local law enforcement officials so they may assist with countering terror activity as well as receiving notification of pending threats in their local jurisdictions. This bill requires the Department to keep Congress apprised of the number of security clearances issued to State and local law enforcement so we can assess whether further congressional action is needed. Because fighting terrorism is not a singular effort of the Federal Government, the ALERT Act provides increased community awareness of ongoing threats. Radicalization is also a clear and present danger to Americans. The number of cases of homegrown terrorism is growing nationwide. Since September 11, 2001, there have been 139 homegrown jihadist plots. Community involvement in countering violent extremism has proven to be effective, as more than 75 percent of U.S. foreign fighter arrests have involved tips from local sources, such as community members, relatives, or friends. This bill will provide even more resources to root out terrorists before they can act. As we are moving into a new era of terrorism that directly threatens our own communities, we must reevaluate how we meet the current threat. Today everyone has a part to play in protecting against terrorism: the neighbor next door and the local police officer. While this legislation will not in itself end the threat of terrorism against our Nation, it will allow for the better use of valuable resources already within our communities. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4401, the Amplifying Local Efforts to Root Out Terror Act, or the ALERT Act, of 2016. Mr. Speaker, this is the latest in a series of efforts by this Congress and, in particular, the Homeland Security Committee in a bipartisan manner to work to thwart terrorist threats in our country. Mr. Speaker, we work continuously to look back at the 9/11 Commission recommendations to make sure that we are fulfilling all of the areas of trouble that were identified by that commission where we can make ourselves more secure from terrorist threats. We also worked very hard as a committee looking at the Boston Marathon bombing. We worked on that and found out that information sharing was not as great as it should have been. In fact, it was one of the things that could have prevented that from occurring. The police commissioner of Boston testified in front of the committee and was asked: Did you know the information that the Federal law enforcement officials had? His answer was: No. Then he was asked: Would it have been helpful for you to know that? And he said: Of course. Yet, that information wasn't available. We have worked in the committee to make sure that information is shared at the local, regional, county, and State levels as well as the Federal law enforcement agency communities. We have worked together successfully with groups like the Joint Terrorism Task Force to make sure that [[Page H1012]] information is shared on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, and, in a policy sense, even on a monthly basis, looking back and making sure that we have a seamless system. Mr. Speaker, we had an initiative that I joined with my colleague from Georgia on as well as four other Members of this House where we traveled to look at the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and the threat to our country resulting from their actions. Sadly, in the United States, there are over 200 people who have been identified as leaving this country to fight for ISIL in Syria and Iraq. Yet, we went through not only the Middle East, but through Europe with our allies there, to see what threats were there in terms of using those countries as portals into the United States, making sure that not only the 200-plus people from the U.S., if they came back, would be able to deal with their threats, but also the threats imposed by other countries coming back to the U.S. We found out that in Istanbul, for instance, at the airport there, there are 61 million flights in that airport alone. That is probably 11 times, roughly, the whole population of my State of Massachusetts. Think of that. We found out that there wasn't security measures in place there that we take for granted in our own country. We also worked hard with our allies in Europe so that they would do the basics and have passenger name records there so that we could trade information to find out who is boarding these planes. We are glad to report that the European Union has acted on that and that has been closed. They are working on areas with the exterior borders that we talked to them about in our trip. We also have been successful as a Congress to work on the visa waiver country issue to make sure that those areas where people are coming back and have traveled to Syria and Iraq are vetted the way they should be vetted. We also realize that not only do we have to fight this war on multiple fronts, but we know that back home the threat of domestic violent extremists remains the number one threat, according to every expert. We know from the work that we have done collectively that we could do more on that front in preventing it. We were told about fusion centers, which are tremendous assets to our security at the local, State, or Federal level, where we worked together gathering and compiling information on a realtime basis. Yet, those fusion centers and the employees there wanted to do more. They were telling us how they could do more if they were given more training, more coordination, and more information to deal with at the local and State level. It would create a great multiplier effect with the frontline law enforcement people that would make our country safer. Along those lines, the gentleman from Georgia put in legislation that I am proud to be a lead sponsor on to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security is there authorizing and providing these resources through the fusion centers to our State and local counterparts. And I think that translating that not only as information to stop and coordinate activities reacting to terrorist acts, but working at the root cause of sharing information that they can use and apply at the root level to prevent that kind of activity, puts those people closer to the community in a position where they can do more. To me, that is one of the most important things we can do as a Congress, to make sure that that work is being done. This is a very important bill. It is a bill that I think, once again, we are seeing the role of Congress in making sure that things don't fall between the cracks in terms of our national security, make sure that the resource is there for our local and State counterparts. I favor this bill because I think it is one of those areas that we found most in need of amplification. I hope this bill is passed. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert). Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his hard work on this legislation, along with Mr. Keating. After listening to both of you speak on this legislation, I am really happy that you get it, that you understand it. This is a great piece of legislation that we are about to enact. I can speak from some experience, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate that Mr. Loudermilk has asked me to speak this evening on this bill. I was in law enforcement for 33 years. I started out in a patrol car and went through various stages of assignments and finally became the sheriff in King County, which is Seattle, Washington. Some of the scenarios that you heard two gentlemen speaking about tonight, I have actually been there, done that, and have experienced some of the frustration that they just described tonight. I know there are going to be some sheriff's deputies and police officers across the country tonight rejoicing in this bill. It will relieve much frustration and also provide some much-needed relief in creating that partnership between Federal and local law enforcement agencies. I am in strong support of the ALERT Act. Today terrorism is not something that is in foreign countries. It is not somewhere outside of the United States. It is not outside our borders. It is right here. It is right here in Washington, D.C. It is right here in Seattle, Washington, as I said, where I come from. {time} 1645 Our sheriff's deputies and police officers have worked with the Federal agencies over these past few years, especially since 2001, in following up on hundreds and thousands of leads every day--of which the public, of course, is not aware--of possible threats and terrorism threats to our local communities. I have had the opportunity to work with almost every Federal law enforcement agency that you can think of since 1972, when I joined the sheriff's office--leaving it in 2005 to come here. I had some great experiences and some not so great experiences. It especially relates back to the sharing of information, and it relates back to the inadequacy of our training and of our ability to connect to the Federal agencies in order to really form a true partnership and a true bond and a true trust. If we can't, as Federal and local agencies, trust each other to share that information--and I know part of the effort here in the ALERT Act is to build that trust and to have the same training and the same information so we can protect the citizens of this country. That is our job, and that is what this law is designed to do. We also need the partnership, the trust, of our communities because as we go out and investigate these leads and investigate these tips of possible terrorist attacks, we are interviewing people who live in our communities. They need to trust us. They need to respect, I should say, not only us here in Congress, but they need to respect our law enforcement agencies and officers across the country. Most of all, our law enforcement agencies need to respect them. That is when we will have that trust by which we can share information and truly come together. The cops cannot protect this country alone. The community cannot protect this country alone. They cannot protect their neighborhoods alone, let alone our country; but we have given more and more responsibility to our local officers, and they are being spread thin. I think that is why, ladies and gentlemen and Mr. Speaker, we are divided today. Cops and community are divided. We don't have that interaction any longer, and that trust that we have built over many, many years is now beginning to erode. I think that this bill goes a long way in building that trust and relationship between the Federal agencies and the local agencies and in providing that training. Most of all, what I appreciate about this legislation is that you have called attention to the fact that local law enforcement is key and is absolutely vital, absolutely critical, to protecting this country and that we are asking them to participate in the defense of our homeland. Not only that, but at the same time, we are asking them to answer those emergency calls--and I am going to mention, if you will allow me a moment--as Officer Ashley Guindon did on her first day as a sheriff's deputy, and she died. That is what we are talking about here: life and [[Page H1013]] death, service to our community, protecting this country. I thank the gentlemen for the hard work. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his leadership on this. With regard to the gentleman from Washington State (Mr. Reichert), I was a district attorney for 12 years and had my own attached State police force. I worked with local law enforcement, and I understand just what he was talking about in terms of the need to communicate, to work together cohesively, and to share information. We are all safer when that occurs. Mr. Speaker, I started my day this morning in Boston. We met at the Federal Reserve. The ``we'' that met was something that, perhaps, you wouldn't have seen a few years ago but that we see today because of the efforts by Congress, the Homeland Security Committee, the gentleman from Georgia, and me in working together across the aisle and in making sure these things happen. It was a meeting on surface transportation threats and terrorist threats. We had our staff and the head of the FBI in our region there. We had the head of the ATF. We had our regional head of the TSA there. We had State officials, local officials, local police, regional police. We had authorities, like the transportation authorities, all present in the room--filling up the room--working together, sharing information. Yet we know we have to do a better job of making sure that occurs going forward. With regard to many of the things we worked on in the committee, some of those agencies made procedural changes. They adopted new priorities that they had not had before. There is the reporting to Congress on the information of foreign terrorist fighters from our European allies, as well as making sure that the Joint Terrorism Task Force is sharing information. With this legislation, we are making sure, going forward, that that is going to continue to be done because oftentimes, unfortunately, we react to a major crisis, respond, and provide the resources. Then, after a period of time, our attention wanes, and we are not constantly making sure that it is being done. This legislation will make sure that it is being done going forward, and it will make sure that these groups are reporting back to Congress on a regular basis so that we are in a position to know that it continues to go forward all the time because, as our attention and our resources and our defensiveness might wane, the threats by terrorists will always be there, unfortunately, in the world we share. This will make sure that the reporting back to Congress occurs as well. I am pleased to say that Congress has an integral role in this. We have crossed a very divided line, unfortunately, that we live with today from a partisan standpoint, and we will work together time and time again, because if we can't work together on issues of our national security, what can we work together on? I thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). I thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. McCaul; the ranking member, Mr. Thompson; and all of the committee members for their efforts going forward. This ALERT Act will keep us safer, not just tomorrow, but in the decades ahead. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me give a heartfelt thanks to my colleagues across the aisle, especially to my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), who mentioned that we have spent a good amount of time together in traveling to the Middle East and to Europe, looking at terrorism. There was a time in our Nation's history when our focus on terrorism was isolated to areas overseas, but no longer. Terrorism is in our neighborhoods and it is in our communities. As you heard here today, from Massachusetts to Georgia to Washington State, there are no geographical boundaries on terrorism even within the United States. While this bill will not end terrorism, it will give critical tools to those who know their communities best. The local law enforcement officer who is on the beat every day knows his community better than anyone. When something isn't just right, he is the first one to notice it. It is critical that we provide them with the training, the security clearances, and the tools that they need to become a force multiplier for our Federal agents who are operating on very limited resources today. In fact, they are stretched very thin. Again, I thank all of those who are in support of this legislation. Of all I have worked on, I believe that this is one of the most important--that being the securing of our Nation so our children will have a nation that is free, safe, and full of opportunity. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4401. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4401, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1010-H1013] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMPLIFYING LOCAL EFFORTS TO ROOT OUT TERROR ACT OF 2016 Mr. LOUDERMILK.

It is a bill that I think, once again, we are seeing the role of Congress in making sure that things don't fall between the cracks in terms of our national security, make sure that the resource is there for our local and State counterparts. I favor this bill because I think it is one of those areas that we found most in need of amplification. I hope this bill is passed. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert). Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his hard work on this legislation, along with Mr. Keating. After listening to both of you speak on this legislation, I am really happy that you get it, that you understand it. This is a great piece of legislation that we are about to enact. I can speak from some experience, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate that Mr. Loudermilk has asked me to speak this evening on this bill. I was in law enforcement for 33 years. I started out in a patrol car and went through various stages of assignments and finally became the sheriff in King County, which is Seattle, Washington. Some of the scenarios that you heard two gentlemen speaking about tonight, I have actually been there, done that, and have experienced some of the frustration that they just described tonight. I know there are going to be some sheriff's deputies and police officers across the country tonight rejoicing in this bill. It will relieve much frustration and also provide some much-needed relief in creating that partnership between Federal and local law enforcement agencies. I am in strong support of the ALERT Act. Today terrorism is not something that is in foreign countries. It is not somewhere outside of the United States. It is not outside our borders. It is right here. It is right here in Washington, D.C. It is right here in Seattle, Washington, as I said, where I come from. {time} 1645 Our sheriff's deputies and police officers have worked with the Federal agencies over these past few years, especially since 2001, in following up on hundreds and thousands of leads every day--of which the public, of course, is not aware--of possible threats and terrorism threats to our local communities. I have had the opportunity to work with almost every Federal law enforcement agency that you can think of since 1972, when I joined the sheriff's office--leaving it in 2005 to come here. I had some great experiences and some not so great experiences. It especially relates back to the sharing of information, and it relates back to the inadequacy of our training and of our ability to connect to the Federal agencies in order to really form a true partnership and a true bond and a true trust. If we can't, as Federal and local agencies, trust each other to share that information--and I know part of the effort here in the ALERT Act is to build that trust and to have the same training and the same information so we can protect the citizens of this country. That is our job, and that is what this law is designed to do. We also need the partnership, the trust, of our communities because as we go out and investigate these leads and investigate these tips of possible terrorist attacks, we are interviewing people who live in our communities. They need to trust us. They need to respect, I should say, not only us here in Congress, but they need to respect our law enforcement agencies and officers across the country. Most of all, our law enforcement agencies need to respect them. That is when we will have that trust by which we can share information and truly come together. The cops cannot protect this country alone. The community cannot protect this country alone. They cannot protect their neighborhoods alone, let alone our country; but we have given more and more responsibility to our local officers, and they are being spread thin. I think that is why, ladies and gentlemen and Mr. Speaker, we are divided today. Cops and community are divided. We don't have that interaction any longer, and that trust that we have built over many, many years is now beginning to erode. I think that this bill goes a long way in building that trust and relationship between the Federal agencies and the local agencies and in providing that training. Most of all, what I appreciate about this legislation is that you have called attention to the fact that local law enforcement is key and is absolutely vital, absolutely critical, to protecting this country and that we are asking them to participate in the defense of our homeland. Not only that, but at the same time, we are asking them to answer those emergency calls--and I am going to mention, if you will allow me a moment--as Officer Ashley Guindon did on her first day as a sheriff's deputy, and she died. That is what we are talking about here: life and [[Page H1013]] death, service to our community, protecting this country. I thank the gentlemen for the hard work. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his leadership on this. With regard to the gentleman from Washington State (Mr. Reichert), I was a district attorney for 12 years and had my own attached State police force. I worked with local law enforcement, and I understand just what he was talking about in terms of the need to communicate, to work together cohesively, and to share information. We are all safer when that occurs. Mr. Speaker, I started my day this morning in Boston. We met at the Federal Reserve. The ``we'' that met was something that, perhaps, you wouldn't have seen a few years ago but that we see today because of the efforts by Congress, the Homeland Security Committee, the gentleman from Georgia, and me in working together across the aisle and in making sure these things happen. It was a meeting on surface transportation threats and terrorist threats. We had our staff and the head of the FBI in our region there. We had the head of the ATF. We had our regional head of the TSA there. We had State officials, local officials, local police, regional police. We had authorities, like the transportation authorities, all present in the room--filling up the room--working together, sharing information. Yet we know we have to do a better job of making sure that occurs going forward. With regard to many of the things we worked on in the committee, some of those agencies made procedural changes. They adopted new priorities that they had not had before. There is the reporting to Congress on the information of foreign terrorist fighters from our European allies, as well as making sure that the Joint Terrorism Task Force is sharing information. With this legislation, we are making sure, going forward, that that is going to continue to be done because oftentimes, unfortunately, we react to a major crisis, respond, and provide the resources. Then, after a period of time, our attention wanes, and we are not constantly making sure that it is being done. This legislation will make sure that it is being done going forward, and it will make sure that these groups are reporting back to Congress on a regular basis so that we are in a position to know that it continues to go forward all the time because, as our attention and our resources and our defensiveness might wane, the threats by terrorists will always be there, unfortunately, in the world we share. This will make sure that the reporting back to Congress occurs as well. I am pleased to say that Congress has an integral role in this. We have crossed a very divided line, unfortunately, that we live with today from a partisan standpoint, and we will work together time and time again, because if we can't work together on issues of our national security, what can we work together on? I thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). I thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. McCaul; the ranking member, Mr. Thompson; and all of the committee members for their efforts going forward. This ALERT Act will keep us safer, not just tomorrow, but in the decades ahead. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Let me give a heartfelt thanks to my colleagues across the aisle, especially to my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), who mentioned that we have spent a good amount of time together in traveling to the Middle East and to Europe, looking at terrorism. There was a time in our Nation's history when our focus on terrorism was isolated to areas overseas, but no longer. Terrorism is in our neighborhoods and it is in our communities. As you heard here today, from Massachusetts to Georgia to Washington State, there are no geographical boundaries on terrorism even within the United States. While this bill will not end terrorism, it will give critical tools to those who know their communities best. The local law enforcement officer who is on the beat every day knows his community better than anyone. When something isn't just right, he is the first one to notice it. It is critical that we provide them with the training, the security clearances, and the tools that they need to become a force multiplier for our Federal agents who are operating on very limited resources today. In fact, they are stretched very thin. Again, I thank all of those who are in support of this legislation. Of all I have worked on, I believe that this is one of the most important--that being the securing of our Nation so our children will have a nation that is free, safe, and full of opportunity. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4401. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4401, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1010-H1013] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMPLIFYING LOCAL EFFORTS TO ROOT OUT TERROR ACT OF 2016 Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4401) to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide countering violent extremism training to Department of Homeland Security representatives at State and local fusion centers, and for other purposes, as amended.

(2) The term ``violent extremism'' means ideologically motivated international terrorism or domestic terrorism, as such terms are defined in section 2331 of title 18, United States Code. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Just 3 short years ago, a group of domestic terrorists were plotting attacks in my hometown in northwest Georgia. Federal law enforcement was informed that these terrorists were trying to obtain pipe bombs and other improvised explosive devices. Once detonated, these weapons could have destroyed property, disabled utilities, and potentially taken innocent human life. Because of the imminent threat, a Federal drug task force had to move quickly to intercept the suspects before they could carry out their attack. With such a short time to react to such a volatile situation, logic would suggest that Federal law enforcement would notify and enlist the assistance of the local sheriff's office. Considering the raid was to take place in the parking lot of a busy shopping center adjacent to a hospital, having local law enforcement assistance was clearly justified. However, there was one problem. The sheriff didn't have the proper security clearance; so, he was not authorized to be briefed on the details of the case. To stop these would-be terrorists, the FBI had to move quickly and could not wait for a waiver to brief the sheriff or to get approval to enlist his assistance. This bureaucratic hurdle put the FBI, our local law enforcement, and the community at greater risk. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this scenario plays out way too often across the Nation. While our FBI and Homeland Security agents are doing an exemplary job of countering terrorist activities, their resources are being stretched very thin. With the threat of terrorism on the rise, we must find a way to provide these agents with additional resources. This is why I have introduced H.R. 4401, the ALERT Act. The Amplifying Local Efforts to Root Out Terror Act removes bureaucratic barriers and paves the way for the Federal Government to enhance State and local law enforcement involvement in fighting the war on terrorism. By providing the tools and training needed to combat terrorism on multiple levels, this act will provide more efficient cooperation and coordination with State and local officials. Local law enforcement is crucial to our security, and they are too often overlooked as a valuable asset in fighting against terrorism. Through this legislation, the Department of Homeland Security will be authorized to train State and local law enforcement in the best methods used in combating evolving terrorist threats. Proper security clearances are also vital for our local law enforcement officials so they may assist with countering terror activity as well as receiving notification of pending threats in their local jurisdictions. This bill requires the Department to keep Congress apprised of the number of security clearances issued to State and local law enforcement so we can assess whether further congressional action is needed. Because fighting terrorism is not a singular effort of the Federal Government, the ALERT Act provides increased community awareness of ongoing threats. Radicalization is also a clear and present danger to Americans. The number of cases of homegrown terrorism is growing nationwide. Since September 11, 2001, there have been 139 homegrown jihadist plots. Community involvement in countering violent extremism has proven to be effective, as more than 75 percent of U.S. foreign fighter arrests have involved tips from local sources, such as community members, relatives, or friends. This bill will provide even more resources to root out terrorists before they can act. As we are moving into a new era of terrorism that directly threatens our own communities, we must reevaluate how we meet the current threat. Today everyone has a part to play in protecting against terrorism: the neighbor next door and the local police officer. While this legislation will not in itself end the threat of terrorism against our Nation, it will allow for the better use of valuable resources already within our communities. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 4401, the Amplifying Local Efforts to Root Out Terror Act, or the ALERT Act, of 2016. Mr. Speaker, this is the latest in a series of efforts by this Congress and, in particular, the Homeland Security Committee in a bipartisan manner to work to thwart terrorist threats in our country. Mr. Speaker, we work continuously to look back at the 9/11 Commission recommendations to make sure that we are fulfilling all of the areas of trouble that were identified by that commission where we can make ourselves more secure from terrorist threats. We also worked very hard as a committee looking at the Boston Marathon bombing. We worked on that and found out that information sharing was not as great as it should have been. In fact, it was one of the things that could have prevented that from occurring. The police commissioner of Boston testified in front of the committee and was asked: Did you know the information that the Federal law enforcement officials had? His answer was: No. Then he was asked: Would it have been helpful for you to know that? And he said: Of course. Yet, that information wasn't available. We have worked in the committee to make sure that information is shared at the local, regional, county, and State levels as well as the Federal law enforcement agency communities. We have worked together successfully with groups like the Joint Terrorism Task Force to make sure that [[Page H1012]] information is shared on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, and, in a policy sense, even on a monthly basis, looking back and making sure that we have a seamless system. Mr. Speaker, we had an initiative that I joined with my colleague from Georgia on as well as four other Members of this House where we traveled to look at the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and the threat to our country resulting from their actions. Sadly, in the United States, there are over 200 people who have been identified as leaving this country to fight for ISIL in Syria and Iraq. Yet, we went through not only the Middle East, but through Europe with our allies there, to see what threats were there in terms of using those countries as portals into the United States, making sure that not only the 200-plus people from the U.S., if they came back, would be able to deal with their threats, but also the threats imposed by other countries coming back to the U.S. We found out that in Istanbul, for instance, at the airport there, there are 61 million flights in that airport alone. That is probably 11 times, roughly, the whole population of my State of Massachusetts. Think of that. We found out that there wasn't security measures in place there that we take for granted in our own country. We also worked hard with our allies in Europe so that they would do the basics and have passenger name records there so that we could trade information to find out who is boarding these planes. We are glad to report that the European Union has acted on that and that has been closed. They are working on areas with the exterior borders that we talked to them about in our trip. We also have been successful as a Congress to work on the visa waiver country issue to make sure that those areas where people are coming back and have traveled to Syria and Iraq are vetted the way they should be vetted. We also realize that not only do we have to fight this war on multiple fronts, but we know that back home the threat of domestic violent extremists remains the number one threat, according to every expert. We know from the work that we have done collectively that we could do more on that front in preventing it. We were told about fusion centers, which are tremendous assets to our security at the local, State, or Federal level, where we worked together gathering and compiling information on a realtime basis. Yet, those fusion centers and the employees there wanted to do more. They were telling us how they could do more if they were given more training, more coordination, and more information to deal with at the local and State level. It would create a great multiplier effect with the frontline law enforcement people that would make our country safer. Along those lines, the gentleman from Georgia put in legislation that I am proud to be a lead sponsor on to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security is there authorizing and providing these resources through the fusion centers to our State and local counterparts. And I think that translating that not only as information to stop and coordinate activities reacting to terrorist acts, but working at the root cause of sharing information that they can use and apply at the root level to prevent that kind of activity, puts those people closer to the community in a position where they can do more. To me, that is one of the most important things we can do as a Congress, to make sure that that work is being done. This is a very important bill. It is a bill that I think, once again, we are seeing the role of Congress in making sure that things don't fall between the cracks in terms of our national security, make sure that the resource is there for our local and State counterparts.

pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from georgia (mr. loudermilk) and the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. keating) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from georgia. general leave mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from georgia? there was no objection. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. just 3 short years ago, a group of domestic terrorists were plotting attacks in my hometown in northwest georgia. federal law enforcement was informed that these terrorists were trying to obtain pipe bombs and other improvised explosive devices. once detonated, these weapons could have destroyed property, disabled utilities, and potentially taken innocent human life. because of the imminent threat, a federal drug task force had to move quickly to intercept the suspects before they could carry out their attack. with such a short time to react to such a volatile situation, logic would suggest that federal law enforcement would notify and enlist the assistance of the local sheriff's office. considering the raid was to take place in the parking lot of a busy shopping center adjacent to a hospital, having local law enforcement assistance was clearly justified. however, there was one problem. the sheriff didn't have the proper security clearance; so, he was not authorized to be briefed on the details of the case. to stop these would-be terrorists, the fbi had to move quickly and could not wait for a waiver to brief the sheriff or to get approval to enlist his assistance. this bureaucratic hurdle put the fbi, our local law enforcement, and the community at greater risk. unfortunately, mr. speaker, this scenario plays out way too often across the nation. while our fbi and homeland security agents are doing an exemplary job of countering terrorist activities, their resources are being stretched very thin. with the threat of terrorism on the rise, we must find a way to provide these agents with additional resources. this is why i have introduced h.r. 4401, the alert act. the amplifying local efforts to root out terror act removes bureaucratic barriers and paves the way for the federal government to enhance state and local law enforcement involvement in fighting the war on terrorism. by providing the tools and training needed to combat terrorism on multiple levels, this act will provide more efficient cooperation and coordination with state and local officials. local law enforcement is crucial to our security, and they are too often overlooked as a valuable asset in fighting against terrorism. through this legislation, the department of homeland security will be authorized to train state and local law enforcement in the best methods used in combating evolving terrorist threats. proper security clearances are also vital for our local law enforcement officials so they may assist with countering terror activity as well as receiving notification of pending threats in their local jurisdictions. this bill requires the department to keep congress apprised of the number of security clearances issued to state and local law enforcement so we can assess whether further congressional action is needed. because fighting terrorism is not a singular effort of the federal government, the alert act provides increased community awareness of ongoing threats. radicalization is also a clear and present danger to americans. the number of cases of homegrown terrorism is growing nationwide. since september 11, 2001, there have been 139 homegrown jihadist plots. community involvement in countering violent extremism has proven to be effective, as more than 75 percent of u.s. foreign fighter arrests have involved tips from local sources, such as community members, relatives, or friends. this bill will provide even more resources to root out terrorists before they can act. as we are moving into a new era of terrorism that directly threatens our own communities, we must reevaluate how we meet the current threat. today everyone has a part to play in protecting against terrorism: the neighbor next door and the local police officer. while this legislation will not in itself end the threat of terrorism against our nation, it will allow for the better use of valuable resources already within our communities. i urge all members to join me in supporting this bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. keating. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 4401, the amplifying local efforts to root out terror act, or the alert act, of 2016. mr. speaker, this is the latest in a series of efforts by this congress and, in particular, the homeland security committee in a bipartisan manner to work to thwart terrorist threats in our country. mr. speaker, we work continuously to look back at the 9/11 commission recommendations to make sure that we are fulfilling all of the areas of trouble that were identified by that commission where we can make ourselves more secure from terrorist threats. we also worked very hard as a committee looking at the boston marathon bombing. we worked on that and found out that information sharing was not as great as it should have been. in fact, it was one of the things that could have prevented that from occurring. the police commissioner of boston testified in front of the committee and was asked: did you know the information that the federal law enforcement officials had? his answer was: no. then he was asked: would it have been helpful for you to know that? and he said: of course. yet, that information wasn't available. we have worked in the committee to make sure that information is shared at the local, regional, county, and state levels as well as the federal law enforcement agency communities. we have worked together successfully with groups like the joint terrorism task force to make sure that [[page h1012]] information is shared on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, and, in a policy sense, even on a monthly basis, looking back and making sure that we have a seamless system. mr. speaker, we had an initiative that i joined with my colleague from georgia on as well as four other members of this house where we traveled to look at the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and the threat to our country resulting from their actions. sadly, in the united states, there are over 200 people who have been identified as leaving this country to fight for isil in syria and iraq. yet, we went through not only the middle east, but through europe with our allies there, to see what threats were there in terms of using those countries as portals into the united states, making sure that not only the 200-plus people from the u.s., if they came back, would be able to deal with their threats, but also the threats imposed by other countries coming back to the u.s. we found out that in istanbul, for instance, at the airport there, there are 61 million flights in that airport alone. that is probably 11 times, roughly, the whole population of my state of massachusetts. think of that. we found out that there wasn't security measures in place there that we take for granted in our own country. we also worked hard with our allies in europe so that they would do the basics and have passenger name records there so that we could trade information to find out who is boarding these planes. we are glad to report that the european union has acted on that and that has been closed. they are working on areas with the exterior borders that we talked to them about in our trip. we also have been successful as a congress to work on the visa waiver country issue to make sure that those areas where people are coming back and have traveled to syria and iraq are vetted the way they should be vetted. we also realize that not only do we have to fight this war on multiple fronts, but we know that back home the threat of domestic violent extremists remains the number one threat, according to every expert. we know from the work that we have done collectively that we could do more on that front in preventing it. we were told about fusion centers, which are tremendous assets to our security at the local, state, or federal level, where we worked together gathering and compiling information on a realtime basis. yet, those fusion centers and the employees there wanted to do more. they were telling us how they could do more if they were given more training, more coordination, and more information to deal with at the local and state level. it would create a great multiplier effect with the frontline law enforcement people that would make our country safer. along those lines, the gentleman from georgia put in legislation that i am proud to be a lead sponsor on to make sure that the department of homeland security is there authorizing and providing these resources through the fusion centers to our state and local counterparts. and i think that translating that not only as information to stop and coordinate activities reacting to terrorist acts, but working at the root cause of sharing information that they can use and apply at the root level to prevent that kind of activity, puts those people closer to the community in a position where they can do more. to me, that is one of the most important things we can do as a congress, to make sure that that work is being done. this is a very important bill. it is a bill that i think, once again, we are seeing the role of congress in making sure that things don't fall between the cracks in terms of our national security, make sure that the resource is there for our local and state counterparts. i favor this bill because i think it is one of those areas that we found most in need of amplification. i hope this bill is passed. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from washington (mr. reichert). mr. reichert. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his hard work on this legislation, along with mr. keating. after listening to both of you speak on this legislation, i am really happy that you get it, that you understand it. this is a great piece of legislation that we are about to enact. i can speak from some experience, mr. speaker. i appreciate that mr. loudermilk has asked me to speak this evening on this bill. i was in law enforcement for 33 years. i started out in a patrol car and went through various stages of assignments and finally became the sheriff in king county, which is seattle, washington. some of the scenarios that you heard two gentlemen speaking about tonight, i have actually been there, done that, and have experienced some of the frustration that they just described tonight. i know there are going to be some sheriff's deputies and police officers across the country tonight rejoicing in this bill. it will relieve much frustration and also provide some much-needed relief in creating that partnership between federal and local law enforcement agencies. i am in strong support of the alert act. today terrorism is not something that is in foreign countries. it is not somewhere outside of the united states. it is not outside our borders. it is right here. it is right here in washington, d.c. it is right here in seattle, washington, as i said, where i come from. {time} 1645 our sheriff's deputies and police officers have worked with the federal agencies over these past few years, especially since 2001, in following up on hundreds and thousands of leads every day--of which the public, of course, is not aware--of possible threats and terrorism threats to our local communities. i have had the opportunity to work with almost every federal law enforcement agency that you can think of since 1972, when i joined the sheriff's office--leaving it in 2005 to come here. i had some great experiences and some not so great experiences. it especially relates back to the sharing of information, and it relates back to the inadequacy of our training and of our ability to connect to the federal agencies in order to really form a true partnership and a true bond and a true trust. if we can't, as federal and local agencies, trust each other to share that information--and i know part of the effort here in the alert act is to build that trust and to have the same training and the same information so we can protect the citizens of this country. that is our job, and that is what this law is designed to do. we also need the partnership, the trust, of our communities because as we go out and investigate these leads and investigate these tips of possible terrorist attacks, we are interviewing people who live in our communities. they need to trust us. they need to respect, i should say, not only us here in congress, but they need to respect our law enforcement agencies and officers across the country. most of all, our law enforcement agencies need to respect them. that is when we will have that trust by which we can share information and truly come together. the cops cannot protect this country alone. the community cannot protect this country alone. they cannot protect their neighborhoods alone, let alone our country; but we have given more and more responsibility to our local officers, and they are being spread thin. i think that is why, ladies and gentlemen and mr. speaker, we are divided today. cops and community are divided. we don't have that interaction any longer, and that trust that we have built over many, many years is now beginning to erode. i think that this bill goes a long way in building that trust and relationship between the federal agencies and the local agencies and in providing that training. most of all, what i appreciate about this legislation is that you have called attention to the fact that local law enforcement is key and is absolutely vital, absolutely critical, to protecting this country and that we are asking them to participate in the defense of our homeland. not only that, but at the same time, we are asking them to answer those emergency calls--and i am going to mention, if you will allow me a moment--as officer ashley guindon did on her first day as a sheriff's deputy, and she died. that is what we are talking about here: life and [[page h1013]] death, service to our community, protecting this country. i thank the gentlemen for the hard work. mr. keating. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. in closing, i thank the gentleman from georgia for his leadership on this. with regard to the gentleman from washington state (mr. reichert), i was a district attorney for 12 years and had my own attached state police force. i worked with local law enforcement, and i understand just what he was talking about in terms of the need to communicate, to work together cohesively, and to share information. we are all safer when that occurs. mr. speaker, i started my day this morning in boston. we met at the federal reserve. the ``we'' that met was something that, perhaps, you wouldn't have seen a few years ago but that we see today because of the efforts by congress, the homeland security committee, the gentleman from georgia, and me in working together across the aisle and in making sure these things happen. it was a meeting on surface transportation threats and terrorist threats. we had our staff and the head of the fbi in our region there. we had the head of the atf. we had our regional head of the tsa there. we had state officials, local officials, local police, regional police. we had authorities, like the transportation authorities, all present in the room--filling up the room--working together, sharing information. yet we know we have to do a better job of making sure that occurs going forward. with regard to many of the things we worked on in the committee, some of those agencies made procedural changes. they adopted new priorities that they had not had before. there is the reporting to congress on the information of foreign terrorist fighters from our european allies, as well as making sure that the joint terrorism task force is sharing information. with this legislation, we are making sure, going forward, that that is going to continue to be done because oftentimes, unfortunately, we react to a major crisis, respond, and provide the resources. then, after a period of time, our attention wanes, and we are not constantly making sure that it is being done. this legislation will make sure that it is being done going forward, and it will make sure that these groups are reporting back to congress on a regular basis so that we are in a position to know that it continues to go forward all the time because, as our attention and our resources and our defensiveness might wane, the threats by terrorists will always be there, unfortunately, in the world we share. this will make sure that the reporting back to congress occurs as well. i am pleased to say that congress has an integral role in this. we have crossed a very divided line, unfortunately, that we live with today from a partisan standpoint, and we will work together time and time again, because if we can't work together on issues of our national security, what can we work together on? i thank my colleague from georgia (mr. loudermilk). i thank the chairman of the committee, mr. mccaul; the ranking member, mr. thompson; and all of the committee members for their efforts going forward. this alert act will keep us safer, not just tomorrow, but in the decades ahead. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. let me give a heartfelt thanks to my colleagues across the aisle, especially to my colleague from massachusetts (mr. keating), who mentioned that we have spent a good amount of time together in traveling to the middle east and to europe, looking at terrorism. there was a time in our nation's history when our focus on terrorism was isolated to areas overseas, but no longer. terrorism is in our neighborhoods and it is in our communities. as you heard here today, from massachusetts to georgia to washington state, there are no geographical boundaries on terrorism even within the united states. while this bill will not end terrorism, it will give critical tools to those who know their communities best. the local law enforcement officer who is on the beat every day knows his community better than anyone. when something isn't just right, he is the first one to notice it. it is critical that we provide them with the training, the security clearances, and the tools that they need to become a force multiplier for our federal agents who are operating on very limited resources today. in fact, they are stretched very thin. again, i thank all of those who are in support of this legislation. of all i have worked on, i believe that this is one of the most important--that being the securing of our nation so our children will have a nation that is free, safe, and full of opportunity. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 4401. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore (mr. duncan of tennessee). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from georgia (mr. loudermilk) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 4401, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",24574

I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my fellow Texans to guide research that will keep America safe, globally competitive, and support nuclear innovation. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Science Committee who cosponsored H.R. 4084. Mr. Speaker, the Science Committee has spent over a year examining U.S. nuclear energy policy and preparation for this legislation. We have been holding hearings on supercomputing, advanced nuclear energy technology, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the DOE Energy Innovation Hubs. Witnesses from the national labs, universities, and the private sector have all testified in support of the various reforms and policies outlined in this bill. We took our time developing this legislation. By working together and listening to all the relevant stakeholders, we have developed broad bipartisan and bicameral support for this bill. We have worked with our colleagues in the Senate to develop companion legislation as well. Last month an amendment with the text of this legislation passed, Mr. Speaker, with historic overwhelming support in the Senate. For the first time in many years, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act will provide updated statutory direction to the Department of Energy's nuclear research activities to ensure that fundamental research is prioritized and precious resources are not wasted. This bill requires DOE to leverage its supercomputing infrastructure and use modeling and simulation capabilities to develop advanced fission and fusion reactors. The bill lays out a clear timeline and parameters for DOE to complete a research reactor. A research reactor is a crucial part of ensuring materials and nuclear fuels R&D can take place in the United States. This type of research requires access to fast neutrons, which, unfortunately, are currently only available for civilian research in Russia, Mr. Speaker. While modeling and simulation can accelerate R&D, nuclear energy must be validated through a physical source. The versatile neutron source under section 6 of H.R. 4084 will provide the United States with that vital capability. {time} 1745 This legislation also directs DOE to partner with the private sector to construct and operate reactor prototypes at DOE National Labs. Nuclear reactors are expensive and highly regulated. Designing a first-of-a-kind reactor requires a blend of creative freedom for engineers to test new designs while ensuring safety throughout the entire process. DOE sites, particularly the DOE National Labs, can provide a unique environment that safely allows for this kind of creative testing and development for advanced nuclear technology, without a burdensome regulatory process which slows progress to a crawl. DOE has fundamental authority to enter into these innovative research partnerships, but won't have the confidence to act without direction from Congress, which is provided in this legislation, Mr. Speaker. America must maintain our nuclear capabilities and continue to develop cutting-edge technology right here at home. Without the direction provided in this bill, we will continue to fall further and further behind, lose the ability to develop innovative nuclear technology, and be left importing reactor designs from overseas. Today, we have the best nuclear engineers and manufacturing capacity in the world right here at home. We can't put that expertise at risk, Mr. Speaker. Even more importantly, this bill will maintain America's capability to influence security and proliferation standards around the world, as more developing nations look to nuclear energy to grow their economies. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am constantly reminded of the need for American leadership in a dangerous world. H.R. 4084 reaffirms the United States' commitment to safely advancing nuclear technology. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. [[Page H1026]] Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. Currently in the United States, nuclear power produces about 20 percent of our Nation's electrical supply, and that makes nuclear power the single largest carbon-free power source in the country. However, our current nuclear fleet is growing older. Many of the plants across our country are many decades old and rely upon nuclear technology that is even older. There have been substantial efforts in the past decade to move towards constructing new nuclear generating units with more modern designs. However, these efforts have had mixed results. There have been construction difficulties, regulatory hurdles, and financing issues, all of which have conspired to delay the construction of new nuclear plants in America. Some of these hurdles, though, are unlikely to go away with our current technologies. The Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima nuclear accidents have repeatedly highlighted the necessity of ensuring our nuclear fleet runs as safely as possible. This has led to much of the cost and difficulty of building the new plants. I think the answer to these problems can be found in innovative new nuclear technologies. The Department of Energy and many different companies in the private sector are working on new forms of nuclear energy generation that hold the promise of much more effective and much safer nuclear generation stations. Some of these technologies also address the extremely important issue of the radioactive waste streams that plague our current generation of nuclear plants. H.R. 4084 takes several positive steps to help spur this innovation and deliver these very promising nuclear technologies to market. I also want to highlight one additional reason to support H.R. 4084. As the world makes commitments to move toward a lower carbon future, as evidenced by the Paris climate agreement, it presents an opportunity to American Industry to supply low-carbon power platforms like nuclear power. This bill will keep our country on the forefront of nuclear power technology, and it is my hope it will empower American Industry to be the suppliers of the next generation of nuclear plants throughout the entire world. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Weber for sponsoring this legislation, and thank Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson for bringing this bill to the floor in such a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, I reserve balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. I appreciate the gentleman's kind remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Weber, for his leadership on this important issue and for allowing me a few moments to speak on it. H.R. 4084 is a critical piece of legislation that will improve our Nation's nuclear energy research and foster the development of our next generation of nuclear reactors. Throughout our history, the United States has led the world in developing new nuclear technologies, and this bill provides the tools to help us to continue this leadership into the future. One of the many important provisions of this bill is that it directs the Department of Energy, through its National Laboratories, to develop new nuclear reactor concepts by partnering with the private sector. With a national population of 320 million, and growing, we must be aggressive in our pursuit of new nuclear breakthroughs in order to power our Nation's future. As a Member of Congress from Georgia, I understand the challenges of providing power to a rapidly growing population. Georgia's population is expected to increase by almost 2 million over the next 10 years, and without clean, affordable, reliable nuclear power, the task of bringing electricity to these new residents would be daunting. The United States has not added any nuclear power generation for over 30 years. However, today, new power units are being built at Plant Vogtle in Georgia. These nuclear power generators will add the capacity to power 1 million homes and businesses once they are completed. After visiting Plant Vogtle last year, I am confident that these new generators will reassure the country that nuclear power is safe, secure, and reliable, and will encourage the pursuit of future nuclear technology breakthroughs. This bill is vital to the future of our Nation because it enables the private sector to utilize the research tools and resources at the DOE National Labs so scientists and engineers in the private sector can assist in the development of new nuclear technologies. Nuclear power generation that is clean, sustainable, and safe, is what will power America's homes and businesses for years to come. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Weber and Mr. Beyer for their congenial work on this issue. I do rise today in support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, as I am a cosponsor. Some of us believe a nuclear energy policy is important to the State of California, which is home to private companies and universities pursuing advanced nuclear technologies. I am proud to support this legislation because it would provide capabilities for our technology innovators to develop new reactors that will yield amazing benefits to society through increased resistance to proliferation, minimizing waste, and perhaps even consuming existing waste stockpiles. The possibilities are endless when we allow our engineers to creatively tackle the world's challenges, and this is no different for nuclear energy. This is important because in my district we have recently seen the issues that can arise when an area is dependent on a single energy source. California is home to many of the companies seeking to partner with the DOE and benefit from our Nation's unparalleled supercomputer capabilities. Leveraging the Department's assets will help our domestic industry capture a significant share of a growing, multibillion-dollar industry. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from Tri Alpha, a California-based fusion company, and UPower, a California- based advanced fission reactor company. Tri Alpha Energy, February 24, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Randy Weber, Chairman, Energy Subcommittee, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, and Representative Weber: Tri Alpha Energy is a fusion energy science research company headquartered in Foothill Ranch, California. Our purpose is to deliver world-changing clean fusion energy for economical, commercial power generation as fast as possible. Tri Alpha started as a research project at the University of California-Irvine in 1990. Today we have 150 employees, over 350 patents issued or pending, and are conducting experiments on a state of the art plasma generation device. We are writing to express support for your bill H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. Global market and environmental conditions demand that new sources of clean, baseload electricity be developed. New nuclear designs hold tremendous promise as a sustainable and cost-competitive power solution, but the United States government must provide a favorable policy environment for the necessary technology developments to take place. H.R. 4084 would make several improvements at the Department of Energy to help move advanced nuclear technology concepts, including fusion, out of the laboratory and toward commercialization. The Nuclear Innovation Center, for example, would enable shorter development and permitting timelines by allowing private companies to work hand-in-hand with federal researchers and regulators on design validation. We commend you and your staff for recognizing the enormous positive potential that advanced nuclear, including fusion, holds in [[Page H1027]] the United States and for offering thoughtful, bipartisan legislation to move the industry forward. We hope that H.R. 4084 will be offered for floor consideration soon and offer our support to help move the bill to final passage. We also look forward to working with your Committee on other fusion energy issues in the future. Please contact me with any questions. Sincerely, Richard C. Barth, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Government Relations, Tri Alpha Energy. ____ January 22, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member, Hon. Randy Weber, Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy and the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Dear Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, Chairman Weber, and Senator Whitehouse, Senator Booker, and Senator Risch: On behalf of UPower Technologies, I am writing to commend your bipartisan leadership and foresight regarding the creation and passage of H.R. 4084 and the Senate companion which compose the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act (the Act). UPower Technologies, Inc., soon to become Oklo, Inc., is a funded advanced reactor startup based in Silicon Valley. We believe that what is good for all advanced nuclear is what's best for the individual companies as well, and in turn what is best for the industry is best for the nation. Each entity in the advanced nuclear industry requires a high-functioning network of a diversity of companies, manufacturers, labs, suppliers, regulators, investors, and other expertise in order to thrive. And the United States will require this home-grown industry to be an international leader in clean energy, to provide high-paying, long-term jobs, and to provide clean power in a safe and reliable manner. Your commendable work on the Nuclear Innovation Capabilities Act will support these important U.S. goals. The Act is a start to look critically at potential ways that the U.S. government can be more efficient both in utilizing its vast, existing investments in infrastructure and expertise, and in removing unreasonable blocks to American innovation. The Act begins to lay out an important framework and focus for the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding advanced nuclear, especially regarding its relationship to industry. While the DOE has many resources in place, such as a wealth of valuable advanced codes and computational resources, a congressional mandate to focus on making these resources more accessible, cost effective, and utilized could make both the DOE complex and the advanced reactor industry more vibrant. The Act also requires the DOE to consider locations for nuclear fueled advanced reactor testing. It will be critical as this process proceeds to ensure that locations for implementations are not limited among the various potential DOE sites and that fees and contracting are in line with reasonable costs and not compensating for irrelevant or excessive overhead. The Act institutes a focus on having a fast reactor resource within the DOE complex. It will be a valuable asset to both the DOE and the industry. The laudable goal of the Act is to streamline U.S. technology development to commercialization. As such, it will be critically important that the DOE work as seamlessly as possible with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as far as providing data and allowing for the licensing activities required for commercialization, so that there need not be a duplication of nuclear-fueled implementations--possibly an exorbitant cost for any startup to survive. The Act also asks the NRC for a report on timeline expectations for advanced reactor licensing. From the perspective of current or future advanced nuclear startup companies, an official report on timelines creates better certainty for private investment. This is potentially a very valuable provision to encourage private investment to further this relatively new U.S. industry. We also encourage continued dialog between the NRC, industry, and other stakeholders regarding how the regulatory process can benefit from significant advances in safety, further reducing uncertainty and accelerating deployment of safe, clean energy. In summary, we support H.R. 4084 and the accompanying Senate bill. We appreciate the focus it brings to key areas to utilize U.S. investments and infrastructure to enhance U.S. innovation in clean energy. We also look forward to future legislation which may add appropriation and clarification of public-private contracting to further enable American innovation. UPower Technologies stands ready to support these important advances in U.S. energy leadership. Sincerely, Jacob DeWitte, CEO and founder, UPower Technologies, Inc. (changing to Oklo, Inc.), Sunnyvale, CA. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, having no further requests for time, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 12 minutes remaining. General Leave Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4084, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 4084 is vital to ensuring America's leadership in nuclear innovation. By harnessing the expertise of our Nation's National Labs, some of which we heard about today, its universities and entrepreneurs, the private sector can take the lead in developing groundbreaking advanced nuclear technology. I especially want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee; of course, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson; those who have also cosponsored the bill, including Dan Lipinski, Barry Loudermilk, Ed Perlmutter, Barbara Comstock, Paul Tonko, Jim Bridenstine, Brian Babin, Dana Rohrabacher, Randy Hultgren, Bruce Westerman, Steve Knight, Bill Posey, Frank Lucas, Randy Neugebauer, and the gentleman from Virginia for his kind remarks. I also want to thank the dozens and dozens of researchers and stakeholders who came in and provided feedback as we developed this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter exchange between the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee on H.R. 4084. House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, February 29, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith: I write in regard to H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act.'' As you are aware, the bill was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, but the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a jurisdictional interest in the bill. I wanted to notify you that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action on H.R. 4084 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. This is done with the understanding that the Committee on Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 4084 and requests your support when such a request is made. I would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 4084 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC, February 29, 2016. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act.'' Your support for this legislation and your assistance in ensuring its timely consideration are greatly appreciated. I agree that a provision in the bill is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I acknowledge that by waiving rights to further consideration of H.R. 4084, your Committee is not relinquishing its jurisdiction. A copy of our letters will be placed in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. I value your cooperation and look forward to working with you as we move ahead with this legislation. Sincerely, Lamar Smith, Chairman. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I appreciate my colleagues' help. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act,'' directs civilian nuclear energy research and development to contribute to American nuclear power. [[Page H1028]] I thank the Energy Subcommittee Chairman, Randy Weber, and Science Committee Ranking Member, Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, for their leadership on this issue. I also want to thank many bipartisan cosponsors of the bill, which include Science Committee Vice Chairman Frank Lucas, Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock and Subcommittee Ranking Member Dan Lipinski, Environment Subcommittee Chairman Jim Bridenstine, Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Barry Loudermilk, Space Subcommittee Chairman Brian Babin, and full committee members Dana Rohrabacher, Ed Perlmutter, Randy Hultgren, Paul Tonko, Bruce Westerman, Steve Knight, Bill Posey, and Randy Neugebauer. I am encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for the subsequently introduced Senate version of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which passed as an amendment to the Energy Policy Modernization Act by a vote of 87-4 on the Senate floor in January. Advanced nuclear energy technology is the best opportunity to make reliable, emission-free electricity available throughout the modern and developing world. America must maintain a strong nuclear technology sector in order to influence global nonproliferation standards. This will help us prevent civilian nuclear energy technology from being misused for weapons development overseas. H.R. 4084 harnesses the strengths of the Department of Energy (DOE) National Labs, universities, and the private sector. It ensures that America's best and brightest minds advance this groundbreaking science and technology. This legislation provides DOE with the direction and certainty it needs to develop plans for long term research and infrastructure development within the Office of Nuclear Energy. H.R. 4084 authorizes DOE to take advantage of the National Labs' supercomputers in order to accelerate research for advanced fission and fusion experimental reactors. This program will leverage expertise from the private sector, universities, and National Labs. The bill provides a clear timeline for DOE to complete a research reactor user facility within ten years. This research reactor will enable proprietary and academic research to develop supercomputing models and also design next generation nuclear energy technology. Finally, H.R. 4084 creates a reliable mechanism for the private sector to partner with DOE labs to build fission and fusion prototype reactors at DOE sites. Nuclear power has been a proven source of safe and emission-free electricity for over half a century. Now, America's strategic investments in advanced nuclear reactor technology can play a more meaningful role to reduce global emissions. Unfortunately, the ability to move innovative technology to the market has been stalled by government red tape. By working around these bureaucratic barriers, H.R. 4084 will spur American competitiveness and keep us on the forefront of nuclear energy technology. This legislation enables our talented engineers in the private sector, academia, and at the National Labs to develop the next generation of nuclear technology here in the United States. Nuclear energy can be a clean, cheap answer to an energy independent, pro-growth, secure future. I thank Chairman Weber and Ranking Member Johnson of Texas for their work on this bill and encourage my colleagues to support it. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which I am very pleased to co-sponsor. Today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our country with clean, reliable energy. Nuclear power is currently the single largest carbon-free component of our electrical supply. One of my top priorities as a Member of Congress is preventing and mitigating the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. I believe that nuclear power can and should play a key role in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our electricity sector. But there currently are technical, economic, and policy challenges that prevent nuclear energy from playing a larger role in enabling our clean energy future. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act takes several positive steps to address these challenges. Implementing the provisions in this bill will help accelerate the development of advanced nuclear energy technologies that are safer, less expensive, more efficient, and produce less waste than the current generation of nuclear reactors. While the results of this research will clearly benefit the American consumers, it is my hope that it will also help spur American industry. As the world collectively moves towards greenhouse gas reductions, we need to make sure that American industry is ready to supply the technologies to fuel the world's low carbon future. This bill will help ensure that American industry will lead the world in supplying next generation nuclear power. I would like to express my appreciation for the process we followed to put this bill together. Majority and Minority staff worked closely together, from engaging stakeholders through crafting and incorporating suggested changes to bill language. This is a great example of what we can achieve when we leave politics at the door and look for common ground to address the challenges facing our nation's research enterprise. Specifically, I'd like to thank my Texas colleague Mr. Weber for sponsoring this legislation, and my other Texas colleague Chairman Smith for working with the Minority to advance this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4084, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1023-H1028] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION CAPABILITIES ACT Mr. WEBER of Texas.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. I want to thank Ranking Member Johnson and Chairman Smith for cosponsoring this important legislation and for their leadership in advocating for nuclear energy research and development. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my fellow Texans to guide research that will keep America safe, globally competitive, and support nuclear innovation. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Science Committee who cosponsored H.R. 4084. Mr. Speaker, the Science Committee has spent over a year examining U.S. nuclear energy policy and preparation for this legislation. We have been holding hearings on supercomputing, advanced nuclear energy technology, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the DOE Energy Innovation Hubs. Witnesses from the national labs, universities, and the private sector have all testified in support of the various reforms and policies outlined in this bill. We took our time developing this legislation. By working together and listening to all the relevant stakeholders, we have developed broad bipartisan and bicameral support for this bill. We have worked with our colleagues in the Senate to develop companion legislation as well. Last month an amendment with the text of this legislation passed, Mr. Speaker, with historic overwhelming support in the Senate. For the first time in many years, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act will provide updated statutory direction to the Department of Energy's nuclear research activities to ensure that fundamental research is prioritized and precious resources are not wasted. This bill requires DOE to leverage its supercomputing infrastructure and use modeling and simulation capabilities to develop advanced fission and fusion reactors. The bill lays out a clear timeline and parameters for DOE to complete a research reactor. A research reactor is a crucial part of ensuring materials and nuclear fuels R&D can take place in the United States. This type of research requires access to fast neutrons, which, unfortunately, are currently only available for civilian research in Russia, Mr. Speaker. While modeling and simulation can accelerate R&D, nuclear energy must be validated through a physical source. The versatile neutron source under section 6 of H.R. 4084 will provide the United States with that vital capability. {time} 1745 This legislation also directs DOE to partner with the private sector to construct and operate reactor prototypes at DOE National Labs. Nuclear reactors are expensive and highly regulated. Designing a first-of-a-kind reactor requires a blend of creative freedom for engineers to test new designs while ensuring safety throughout the entire process. DOE sites, particularly the DOE National Labs, can provide a unique environment that safely allows for this kind of creative testing and development for advanced nuclear technology, without a burdensome regulatory process which slows progress to a crawl. DOE has fundamental authority to enter into these innovative research partnerships, but won't have the confidence to act without direction from Congress, which is provided in this legislation, Mr. Speaker. America must maintain our nuclear capabilities and continue to develop cutting-edge technology right here at home. Without the direction provided in this bill, we will continue to fall further and further behind, lose the ability to develop innovative nuclear technology, and be left importing reactor designs from overseas. Today, we have the best nuclear engineers and manufacturing capacity in the world right here at home. We can't put that expertise at risk, Mr. Speaker. Even more importantly, this bill will maintain America's capability to influence security and proliferation standards around the world, as more developing nations look to nuclear energy to grow their economies. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am constantly reminded of the need for American leadership in a dangerous world. H.R. 4084 reaffirms the United States' commitment to safely advancing nuclear technology. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. [[Page H1026]] Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. Currently in the United States, nuclear power produces about 20 percent of our Nation's electrical supply, and that makes nuclear power the single largest carbon-free power source in the country. However, our current nuclear fleet is growing older. Many of the plants across our country are many decades old and rely upon nuclear technology that is even older. There have been substantial efforts in the past decade to move towards constructing new nuclear generating units with more modern designs. However, these efforts have had mixed results. There have been construction difficulties, regulatory hurdles, and financing issues, all of which have conspired to delay the construction of new nuclear plants in America. Some of these hurdles, though, are unlikely to go away with our current technologies. The Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima nuclear accidents have repeatedly highlighted the necessity of ensuring our nuclear fleet runs as safely as possible. This has led to much of the cost and difficulty of building the new plants. I think the answer to these problems can be found in innovative new nuclear technologies. The Department of Energy and many different companies in the private sector are working on new forms of nuclear energy generation that hold the promise of much more effective and much safer nuclear generation stations. Some of these technologies also address the extremely important issue of the radioactive waste streams that plague our current generation of nuclear plants. H.R. 4084 takes several positive steps to help spur this innovation and deliver these very promising nuclear technologies to market. I also want to highlight one additional reason to support H.R. 4084. As the world makes commitments to move toward a lower carbon future, as evidenced by the Paris climate agreement, it presents an opportunity to American Industry to supply low-carbon power platforms like nuclear power. This bill will keep our country on the forefront of nuclear power technology, and it is my hope it will empower American Industry to be the suppliers of the next generation of nuclear plants throughout the entire world. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Weber for sponsoring this legislation, and thank Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson for bringing this bill to the floor in such a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, I reserve balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. I appreciate the gentleman's kind remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Weber, for his leadership on this important issue and for allowing me a few moments to speak on it. H.R. 4084 is a critical piece of legislation that will improve our Nation's nuclear energy research and foster the development of our next generation of nuclear reactors. Throughout our history, the United States has led the world in developing new nuclear technologies, and this bill provides the tools to help us to continue this leadership into the future. One of the many important provisions of this bill is that it directs the Department of Energy, through its National Laboratories, to develop new nuclear reactor concepts by partnering with the private sector. With a national population of 320 million, and growing, we must be aggressive in our pursuit of new nuclear breakthroughs in order to power our Nation's future. As a Member of Congress from Georgia, I understand the challenges of providing power to a rapidly growing population. Georgia's population is expected to increase by almost 2 million over the next 10 years, and without clean, affordable, reliable nuclear power, the task of bringing electricity to these new residents would be daunting. The United States has not added any nuclear power generation for over 30 years. However, today, new power units are being built at Plant Vogtle in Georgia. These nuclear power generators will add the capacity to power 1 million homes and businesses once they are completed. After visiting Plant Vogtle last year, I am confident that these new generators will reassure the country that nuclear power is safe, secure, and reliable, and will encourage the pursuit of future nuclear technology breakthroughs. This bill is vital to the future of our Nation because it enables the private sector to utilize the research tools and resources at the DOE National Labs so scientists and engineers in the private sector can assist in the development of new nuclear technologies. Nuclear power generation that is clean, sustainable, and safe, is what will power America's homes and businesses for years to come. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Weber and Mr. Beyer for their congenial work on this issue. I do rise today in support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, as I am a cosponsor. Some of us believe a nuclear energy policy is important to the State of California, which is home to private companies and universities pursuing advanced nuclear technologies. I am proud to support this legislation because it would provide capabilities for our technology innovators to develop new reactors that will yield amazing benefits to society through increased resistance to proliferation, minimizing waste, and perhaps even consuming existing waste stockpiles. The possibilities are endless when we allow our engineers to creatively tackle the world's challenges, and this is no different for nuclear energy. This is important because in my district we have recently seen the issues that can arise when an area is dependent on a single energy source. California is home to many of the companies seeking to partner with the DOE and benefit from our Nation's unparalleled supercomputer capabilities. Leveraging the Department's assets will help our domestic industry capture a significant share of a growing, multibillion-dollar industry. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from Tri Alpha, a California-based fusion company, and UPower, a California- based advanced fission reactor company. Tri Alpha Energy, February 24, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Randy Weber, Chairman, Energy Subcommittee, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, and Representative Weber: Tri Alpha Energy is a fusion energy science research company headquartered in Foothill Ranch, California. Our purpose is to deliver world-changing clean fusion energy for economical, commercial power generation as fast as possible. Tri Alpha started as a research project at the University of California-Irvine in 1990. Today we have 150 employees, over 350 patents issued or pending, and are conducting experiments on a state of the art plasma generation device. We are writing to express support for your bill H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. Global market and environmental conditions demand that new sources of clean, baseload electricity be developed. New nuclear designs hold tremendous promise as a sustainable and cost-competitive power solution, but the United States government must provide a favorable policy environment for the necessary technology developments to take place. H.R. 4084 would make several improvements at the Department of Energy to help move advanced nuclear technology concepts, including fusion, out of the laboratory and toward commercialization. The Nuclear Innovation Center, for example, would enable shorter development and permitting timelines by allowing private companies to work hand-in-hand with federal researchers and regulators on design validation. We commend you and your staff for recognizing the enormous positive potential that advanced nuclear, including fusion, holds in [[Page H1027]] the United States and for offering thoughtful, bipartisan legislation to move the industry forward. We hope that H.R. 4084 will be offered for floor consideration soon and offer our support to help move the bill to final passage. We also look forward to working with your Committee on other fusion energy issues in the future. Please contact me with any questions. Sincerely, Richard C. Barth, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Government Relations, Tri Alpha Energy. ____ January 22, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member, Hon. Randy Weber, Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy and the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Dear Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, Chairman Weber, and Senator Whitehouse, Senator Booker, and Senator Risch: On behalf of UPower Technologies, I am writing to commend your bipartisan leadership and foresight regarding the creation and passage of H.R. 4084 and the Senate companion which compose the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act (the Act). UPower Technologies, Inc., soon to become Oklo, Inc., is a funded advanced reactor startup based in Silicon Valley. We believe that what is good for all advanced nuclear is what's best for the individual companies as well, and in turn what is best for the industry is best for the nation. Each entity in the advanced nuclear industry requires a high-functioning network of a diversity of companies, manufacturers, labs, suppliers, regulators, investors, and other expertise in order to thrive. And the United States will require this home-grown industry to be an international leader in clean energy, to provide high-paying, long-term jobs, and to provide clean power in a safe and reliable manner. Your commendable work on the Nuclear Innovation Capabilities Act will support these important U.S. goals. The Act is a start to look critically at potential ways that the U.S. government can be more efficient both in utilizing its vast, existing investments in infrastructure and expertise, and in removing unreasonable blocks to American innovation. The Act begins to lay out an important framework and focus for the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding advanced nuclear, especially regarding its relationship to industry. While the DOE has many resources in place, such as a wealth of valuable advanced codes and computational resources, a congressional mandate to focus on making these resources more accessible, cost effective, and utilized could make both the DOE complex and the advanced reactor industry more vibrant. The Act also requires the DOE to consider locations for nuclear fueled advanced reactor testing. It will be critical as this process proceeds to ensure that locations for implementations are not limited among the various potential DOE sites and that fees and contracting are in line with reasonable costs and not compensating for irrelevant or excessive overhead. The Act institutes a focus on having a fast reactor resource within the DOE complex. It will be a valuable asset to both the DOE and the industry. The laudable goal of the Act is to streamline U.S. technology development to commercialization. As such, it will be critically important that the DOE work as seamlessly as possible with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as far as providing data and allowing for the licensing activities required for commercialization, so that there need not be a duplication of nuclear-fueled implementations--possibly an exorbitant cost for any startup to survive. The Act also asks the NRC for a report on timeline expectations for advanced reactor licensing. From the perspective of current or future advanced nuclear startup companies, an official report on timelines creates better certainty for private investment. This is potentially a very valuable provision to encourage private investment to further this relatively new U.S. industry. We also encourage continued dialog between the NRC, industry, and other stakeholders regarding how the regulatory process can benefit from significant advances in safety, further reducing uncertainty and accelerating deployment of safe, clean energy. In summary, we support H.R. 4084 and the accompanying Senate bill. We appreciate the focus it brings to key areas to utilize U.S. investments and infrastructure to enhance U.S. innovation in clean energy. We also look forward to future legislation which may add appropriation and clarification of public-private contracting to further enable American innovation. UPower Technologies stands ready to support these important advances in U.S. energy leadership. Sincerely, Jacob DeWitte, CEO and founder, UPower Technologies, Inc. (changing to Oklo, Inc.), Sunnyvale, CA. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, having no further requests for time, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 12 minutes remaining. General Leave Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4084, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 4084 is vital to ensuring America's leadership in nuclear innovation. By harnessing the expertise of our Nation's National Labs, some of which we heard about today, its universities and entrepreneurs, the private sector can take the lead in developing groundbreaking advanced nuclear technology. I especially want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee; of course, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson; those who have also cosponsored the bill, including Dan Lipinski, Barry Loudermilk, Ed Perlmutter, Barbara Comstock, Paul Tonko, Jim Bridenstine, Brian Babin, Dana Rohrabacher, Randy Hultgren, Bruce Westerman, Steve Knight, Bill Posey, Frank Lucas, Randy Neugebauer, and the gentleman from Virginia for his kind remarks. I also want to thank the dozens and dozens of researchers and stakeholders who came in and provided feedback as we developed this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter exchange between the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee on H.R. 4084. House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, February 29, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith: I write in regard to H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act.'' As you are aware, the bill was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, but the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a jurisdictional interest in the bill. I wanted to notify you that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action on H.R. 4084 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. This is done with the understanding that the Committee on Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 4084 and requests your support when such a request is made. I would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 4084 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC, February 29, 2016. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act.'' Your support for this legislation and your assistance in ensuring its timely consideration are greatly appreciated. I agree that a provision in the bill is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I acknowledge that by waiving rights to further consideration of H.R. 4084, your Committee is not relinquishing its jurisdiction. A copy of our letters will be placed in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. I value your cooperation and look forward to working with you as we move ahead with this legislation. Sincerely, Lamar Smith, Chairman. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I appreciate my colleagues' help. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act,'' directs civilian nuclear energy research and development to contribute to American nuclear power. [[Page H1028]] I thank the Energy Subcommittee Chairman, Randy Weber, and Science Committee Ranking Member, Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, for their leadership on this issue. I also want to thank many bipartisan cosponsors of the bill, which include Science Committee Vice Chairman Frank Lucas, Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock and Subcommittee Ranking Member Dan Lipinski, Environment Subcommittee Chairman Jim Bridenstine, Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Barry Loudermilk, Space Subcommittee Chairman Brian Babin, and full committee members Dana Rohrabacher, Ed Perlmutter, Randy Hultgren, Paul Tonko, Bruce Westerman, Steve Knight, Bill Posey, and Randy Neugebauer. I am encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for the subsequently introduced Senate version of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which passed as an amendment to the Energy Policy Modernization Act by a vote of 87-4 on the Senate floor in January. Advanced nuclear energy technology is the best opportunity to make reliable, emission-free electricity available throughout the modern and developing world. America must maintain a strong nuclear technology sector in order to influence global nonproliferation standards. This will help us prevent civilian nuclear energy technology from being misused for weapons development overseas. H.R. 4084 harnesses the strengths of the Department of Energy (DOE) National Labs, universities, and the private sector. It ensures that America's best and brightest minds advance this groundbreaking science and technology. This legislation provides DOE with the direction and certainty it needs to develop plans for long term research and infrastructure development within the Office of Nuclear Energy. H.R. 4084 authorizes DOE to take advantage of the National Labs' supercomputers in order to accelerate research for advanced fission and fusion experimental reactors. This program will leverage expertise from the private sector, universities, and National Labs. The bill provides a clear timeline for DOE to complete a research reactor user facility within ten years. This research reactor will enable proprietary and academic research to develop supercomputing models and also design next generation nuclear energy technology. Finally, H.R. 4084 creates a reliable mechanism for the private sector to partner with DOE labs to build fission and fusion prototype reactors at DOE sites. Nuclear power has been a proven source of safe and emission-free electricity for over half a century. Now, America's strategic investments in advanced nuclear reactor technology can play a more meaningful role to reduce global emissions. Unfortunately, the ability to move innovative technology to the market has been stalled by government red tape. By working around these bureaucratic barriers, H.R. 4084 will spur American competitiveness and keep us on the forefront of nuclear energy technology. This legislation enables our talented engineers in the private sector, academia, and at the National Labs to develop the next generation of nuclear technology here in the United States. Nuclear energy can be a clean, cheap answer to an energy independent, pro-growth, secure future. I thank Chairman Weber and Ranking Member Johnson of Texas for their work on this bill and encourage my colleagues to support it. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which I am very pleased to co-sponsor. Today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our country with clean, reliable energy. Nuclear power is currently the single largest carbon-free component of our electrical supply. One of my top priorities as a Member of Congress is preventing and mitigating the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. I believe that nuclear power can and should play a key role in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our electricity sector. But there currently are technical, economic, and policy challenges that prevent nuclear energy from playing a larger role in enabling our clean energy future. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act takes several positive steps to address these challenges. Implementing the provisions in this bill will help accelerate the development of advanced nuclear energy technologies that are safer, less expensive, more efficient, and produce less waste than the current generation of nuclear reactors. While the results of this research will clearly benefit the American consumers, it is my hope that it will also help spur American industry. As the world collectively moves towards greenhouse gas reductions, we need to make sure that American industry is ready to supply the technologies to fuel the world's low carbon future. This bill will help ensure that American industry will lead the world in supplying next generation nuclear power. I would like to express my appreciation for the process we followed to put this bill together. Majority and Minority staff worked closely together, from engaging stakeholders through crafting and incorporating suggested changes to bill language. This is a great example of what we can achieve when we leave politics at the door and look for common ground to address the challenges facing our nation's research enterprise. Specifically, I'd like to thank my Texas colleague Mr. Weber for sponsoring this legislation, and my other Texas colleague Chairman Smith for working with the Minority to advance this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4084, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1023-H1028] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION CAPABILITIES ACT Mr. WEBER of Texas.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. I want to thank Ranking Member Johnson and Chairman Smith for cosponsoring this important legislation and for their leadership in advocating for nuclear energy research and development. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my fellow Texans to guide research that will keep America safe, globally competitive, and support nuclear innovation. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Science Committee who cosponsored H.R. 4084. Mr. Speaker, the Science Committee has spent over a year examining U.S. nuclear energy policy and preparation for this legislation. We have been holding hearings on supercomputing, advanced nuclear energy technology, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the DOE Energy Innovation Hubs. Witnesses from the national labs, universities, and the private sector have all testified in support of the various reforms and policies outlined in this bill. We took our time developing this legislation. By working together and listening to all the relevant stakeholders, we have developed broad bipartisan and bicameral support for this bill. We have worked with our colleagues in the Senate to develop companion legislation as well. Last month an amendment with the text of this legislation passed, Mr. Speaker, with historic overwhelming support in the Senate. For the first time in many years, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act will provide updated statutory direction to the Department of Energy's nuclear research activities to ensure that fundamental research is prioritized and precious resources are not wasted. This bill requires DOE to leverage its supercomputing infrastructure and use modeling and simulation capabilities to develop advanced fission and fusion reactors. The bill lays out a clear timeline and parameters for DOE to complete a research reactor. A research reactor is a crucial part of ensuring materials and nuclear fuels R&D can take place in the United States. This type of research requires access to fast neutrons, which, unfortunately, are currently only available for civilian research in Russia, Mr. Speaker. While modeling and simulation can accelerate R&D, nuclear energy must be validated through a physical source. The versatile neutron source under section 6 of H.R. 4084 will provide the United States with that vital capability. {time} 1745 This legislation also directs DOE to partner with the private sector to construct and operate reactor prototypes at DOE National Labs. Nuclear reactors are expensive and highly regulated. Designing a first-of-a-kind reactor requires a blend of creative freedom for engineers to test new designs while ensuring safety throughout the entire process. DOE sites, particularly the DOE National Labs, can provide a unique environment that safely allows for this kind of creative testing and development for advanced nuclear technology, without a burdensome regulatory process which slows progress to a crawl. DOE has fundamental authority to enter into these innovative research partnerships, but won't have the confidence to act without direction from Congress, which is provided in this legislation, Mr. Speaker. America must maintain our nuclear capabilities and continue to develop cutting-edge technology right here at home. Without the direction provided in this bill, we will continue to fall further and further behind, lose the ability to develop innovative nuclear technology, and be left importing reactor designs from overseas. Today, we have the best nuclear engineers and manufacturing capacity in the world right here at home. We can't put that expertise at risk, Mr. Speaker. Even more importantly, this bill will maintain America's capability to influence security and proliferation standards around the world, as more developing nations look to nuclear energy to grow their economies. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am constantly reminded of the need for American leadership in a dangerous world. H.R. 4084 reaffirms the United States' commitment to safely advancing nuclear technology. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. [[Page H1026]] Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. Currently in the United States, nuclear power produces about 20 percent of our Nation's electrical supply, and that makes nuclear power the single largest carbon-free power source in the country. However, our current nuclear fleet is growing older. Many of the plants across our country are many decades old and rely upon nuclear technology that is even older. There have been substantial efforts in the past decade to move towards constructing new nuclear generating units with more modern designs. However, these efforts have had mixed results. There have been construction difficulties, regulatory hurdles, and financing issues, all of which have conspired to delay the construction of new nuclear plants in America. Some of these hurdles, though, are unlikely to go away with our current technologies. The Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima nuclear accidents have repeatedly highlighted the necessity of ensuring our nuclear fleet runs as safely as possible. This has led to much of the cost and difficulty of building the new plants. I think the answer to these problems can be found in innovative new nuclear technologies. The Department of Energy and many different companies in the private sector are working on new forms of nuclear energy generation that hold the promise of much more effective and much safer nuclear generation stations. Some of these technologies also address the extremely important issue of the radioactive waste streams that plague our current generation of nuclear plants. H.R. 4084 takes several positive steps to help spur this innovation and deliver these very promising nuclear technologies to market. I also want to highlight one additional reason to support H.R. 4084. As the world makes commitments to move toward a lower carbon future, as evidenced by the Paris climate agreement, it presents an opportunity to American Industry to supply low-carbon power platforms like nuclear power. This bill will keep our country on the forefront of nuclear power technology, and it is my hope it will empower American Industry to be the suppliers of the next generation of nuclear plants throughout the entire world. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Weber for sponsoring this legislation, and thank Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson for bringing this bill to the floor in such a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, I reserve balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. I appreciate the gentleman's kind remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Weber, for his leadership on this important issue and for allowing me a few moments to speak on it. H.R. 4084 is a critical piece of legislation that will improve our Nation's nuclear energy research and foster the development of our next generation of nuclear reactors. Throughout our history, the United States has led the world in developing new nuclear technologies, and this bill provides the tools to help us to continue this leadership into the future. One of the many important provisions of this bill is that it directs the Department of Energy, through its National Laboratories, to develop new nuclear reactor concepts by partnering with the private sector. With a national population of 320 million, and growing, we must be aggressive in our pursuit of new nuclear breakthroughs in order to power our Nation's future. As a Member of Congress from Georgia, I understand the challenges of providing power to a rapidly growing population. Georgia's population is expected to increase by almost 2 million over the next 10 years, and without clean, affordable, reliable nuclear power, the task of bringing electricity to these new residents would be daunting. The United States has not added any nuclear power generation for over 30 years. However, today, new power units are being built at Plant Vogtle in Georgia. These nuclear power generators will add the capacity to power 1 million homes and businesses once they are completed. After visiting Plant Vogtle last year, I am confident that these new generators will reassure the country that nuclear power is safe, secure, and reliable, and will encourage the pursuit of future nuclear technology breakthroughs. This bill is vital to the future of our Nation because it enables the private sector to utilize the research tools and resources at the DOE National Labs so scientists and engineers in the private sector can assist in the development of new nuclear technologies. Nuclear power generation that is clean, sustainable, and safe, is what will power America's homes and businesses for years to come. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Weber and Mr. Beyer for their congenial work on this issue. I do rise today in support of H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, as I am a cosponsor. Some of us believe a nuclear energy policy is important to the State of California, which is home to private companies and universities pursuing advanced nuclear technologies. I am proud to support this legislation because it would provide capabilities for our technology innovators to develop new reactors that will yield amazing benefits to society through increased resistance to proliferation, minimizing waste, and perhaps even consuming existing waste stockpiles. The possibilities are endless when we allow our engineers to creatively tackle the world's challenges, and this is no different for nuclear energy. This is important because in my district we have recently seen the issues that can arise when an area is dependent on a single energy source. California is home to many of the companies seeking to partner with the DOE and benefit from our Nation's unparalleled supercomputer capabilities. Leveraging the Department's assets will help our domestic industry capture a significant share of a growing, multibillion-dollar industry. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from Tri Alpha, a California-based fusion company, and UPower, a California- based advanced fission reactor company. Tri Alpha Energy, February 24, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Randy Weber, Chairman, Energy Subcommittee, House Science, Space & Technology Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, and Representative Weber: Tri Alpha Energy is a fusion energy science research company headquartered in Foothill Ranch, California. Our purpose is to deliver world-changing clean fusion energy for economical, commercial power generation as fast as possible. Tri Alpha started as a research project at the University of California-Irvine in 1990. Today we have 150 employees, over 350 patents issued or pending, and are conducting experiments on a state of the art plasma generation device. We are writing to express support for your bill H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. Global market and environmental conditions demand that new sources of clean, baseload electricity be developed. New nuclear designs hold tremendous promise as a sustainable and cost-competitive power solution, but the United States government must provide a favorable policy environment for the necessary technology developments to take place. H.R. 4084 would make several improvements at the Department of Energy to help move advanced nuclear technology concepts, including fusion, out of the laboratory and toward commercialization. The Nuclear Innovation Center, for example, would enable shorter development and permitting timelines by allowing private companies to work hand-in-hand with federal researchers and regulators on design validation. We commend you and your staff for recognizing the enormous positive potential that advanced nuclear, including fusion, holds in [[Page H1027]] the United States and for offering thoughtful, bipartisan legislation to move the industry forward. We hope that H.R. 4084 will be offered for floor consideration soon and offer our support to help move the bill to final passage. We also look forward to working with your Committee on other fusion energy issues in the future. Please contact me with any questions. Sincerely, Richard C. Barth, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Government Relations, Tri Alpha Energy. ____ January 22, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, Ranking Member, Hon. Randy Weber, Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy and the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Dear Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, Chairman Weber, and Senator Whitehouse, Senator Booker, and Senator Risch: On behalf of UPower Technologies, I am writing to commend your bipartisan leadership and foresight regarding the creation and passage of H.R. 4084 and the Senate companion which compose the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act (the Act). UPower Technologies, Inc., soon to become Oklo, Inc., is a funded advanced reactor startup based in Silicon Valley. We believe that what is good for all advanced nuclear is what's best for the individual companies as well, and in turn what is best for the industry is best for the nation. Each entity in the advanced nuclear industry requires a high-functioning network of a diversity of companies, manufacturers, labs, suppliers, regulators, investors, and other expertise in order to thrive. And the United States will require this home-grown industry to be an international leader in clean energy, to provide high-paying, long-term jobs, and to provide clean power in a safe and reliable manner. Your commendable work on the Nuclear Innovation Capabilities Act will support these important U.S. goals. The Act is a start to look critically at potential ways that the U.S. government can be more efficient both in utilizing its vast, existing investments in infrastructure and expertise, and in removing unreasonable blocks to American innovation. The Act begins to lay out an important framework and focus for the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding advanced nuclear, especially regarding its relationship to industry. While the DOE has many resources in place, such as a wealth of valuable advanced codes and computational resources, a congressional mandate to focus on making these resources more accessible, cost effective, and utilized could make both the DOE complex and the advanced reactor industry more vibrant. The Act also requires the DOE to consider locations for nuclear fueled advanced reactor testing. It will be critical as this process proceeds to ensure that locations for implementations are not limited among the various potential DOE sites and that fees and contracting are in line with reasonable costs and not compensating for irrelevant or excessive overhead. The Act institutes a focus on having a fast reactor resource within the DOE complex. It will be a valuable asset to both the DOE and the industry. The laudable goal of the Act is to streamline U.S. technology development to commercialization. As such, it will be critically important that the DOE work as seamlessly as possible with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as far as providing data and allowing for the licensing activities required for commercialization, so that there need not be a duplication of nuclear-fueled implementations--possibly an exorbitant cost for any startup to survive. The Act also asks the NRC for a report on timeline expectations for advanced reactor licensing. From the perspective of current or future advanced nuclear startup companies, an official report on timelines creates better certainty for private investment. This is potentially a very valuable provision to encourage private investment to further this relatively new U.S. industry. We also encourage continued dialog between the NRC, industry, and other stakeholders regarding how the regulatory process can benefit from significant advances in safety, further reducing uncertainty and accelerating deployment of safe, clean energy. In summary, we support H.R. 4084 and the accompanying Senate bill. We appreciate the focus it brings to key areas to utilize U.S. investments and infrastructure to enhance U.S. innovation in clean energy. We also look forward to future legislation which may add appropriation and clarification of public-private contracting to further enable American innovation. UPower Technologies stands ready to support these important advances in U.S. energy leadership. Sincerely, Jacob DeWitte, CEO and founder, UPower Technologies, Inc. (changing to Oklo, Inc.), Sunnyvale, CA. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, having no further requests for time, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 12 minutes remaining. General Leave Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4084, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 4084 is vital to ensuring America's leadership in nuclear innovation. By harnessing the expertise of our Nation's National Labs, some of which we heard about today, its universities and entrepreneurs, the private sector can take the lead in developing groundbreaking advanced nuclear technology. I especially want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee; of course, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson; those who have also cosponsored the bill, including Dan Lipinski, Barry Loudermilk, Ed Perlmutter, Barbara Comstock, Paul Tonko, Jim Bridenstine, Brian Babin, Dana Rohrabacher, Randy Hultgren, Bruce Westerman, Steve Knight, Bill Posey, Frank Lucas, Randy Neugebauer, and the gentleman from Virginia for his kind remarks. I also want to thank the dozens and dozens of researchers and stakeholders who came in and provided feedback as we developed this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter exchange between the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee on H.R. 4084. House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, February 29, 2016. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith: I write in regard to H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act.'' As you are aware, the bill was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, but the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a jurisdictional interest in the bill. I wanted to notify you that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action on H.R. 4084 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. This is done with the understanding that the Committee on Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 4084 and requests your support when such a request is made. I would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 4084 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC, February 29, 2016. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act.'' Your support for this legislation and your assistance in ensuring its timely consideration are greatly appreciated. I agree that a provision in the bill is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I acknowledge that by waiving rights to further consideration of H.R. 4084, your Committee is not relinquishing its jurisdiction. A copy of our letters will be placed in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. I value your cooperation and look forward to working with you as we move ahead with this legislation. Sincerely, Lamar Smith, Chairman. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I appreciate my colleagues' help. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4084, the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act,'' directs civilian nuclear energy research and development to contribute to American nuclear power. [[Page H1028]] I thank the Energy Subcommittee Chairman, Randy Weber, and Science Committee Ranking Member, Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, for their leadership on this issue. I also want to thank many bipartisan cosponsors of the bill, which include Science Committee Vice Chairman Frank Lucas, Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock and Subcommittee Ranking Member Dan Lipinski, Environment Subcommittee Chairman Jim Bridenstine, Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Barry Loudermilk, Space Subcommittee Chairman Brian Babin, and full committee members Dana Rohrabacher, Ed Perlmutter, Randy Hultgren, Paul Tonko, Bruce Westerman, Steve Knight, Bill Posey, and Randy Neugebauer. I am encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for the subsequently introduced Senate version of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which passed as an amendment to the Energy Policy Modernization Act by a vote of 87-4 on the Senate floor in January. Advanced nuclear energy technology is the best opportunity to make reliable, emission-free electricity available throughout the modern and developing world. America must maintain a strong nuclear technology sector in order to influence global nonproliferation standards. This will help us prevent civilian nuclear energy technology from being misused for weapons development overseas. H.R. 4084 harnesses the strengths of the Department of Energy (DOE) National Labs, universities, and the private sector. It ensures that America's best and brightest minds advance this groundbreaking science and technology. This legislation provides DOE with the direction and certainty it needs to develop plans for long term research and infrastructure development within the Office of Nuclear Energy. H.R. 4084 authorizes DOE to take advantage of the National Labs' supercomputers in order to accelerate research for advanced fission and fusion experimental reactors. This program will leverage expertise from the private sector, universities, and National Labs. The bill provides a clear timeline for DOE to complete a research reactor user facility within ten years. This research reactor will enable proprietary and academic research to develop supercomputing models and also design next generation nuclear energy technology. Finally, H.R. 4084 creates a reliable mechanism for the private sector to partner with DOE labs to build fission and fusion prototype reactors at DOE sites. Nuclear power has been a proven source of safe and emission-free electricity for over half a century. Now, America's strategic investments in advanced nuclear reactor technology can play a more meaningful role to reduce global emissions. Unfortunately, the ability to move innovative technology to the market has been stalled by government red tape. By working around these bureaucratic barriers, H.R. 4084 will spur American competitiveness and keep us on the forefront of nuclear energy technology. This legislation enables our talented engineers in the private sector, academia, and at the National Labs to develop the next generation of nuclear technology here in the United States. Nuclear energy can be a clean, cheap answer to an energy independent, pro-growth, secure future. I thank Chairman Weber and Ranking Member Johnson of Texas for their work on this bill and encourage my colleagues to support it. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 4084, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which I am very pleased to co-sponsor. Today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our country with clean, reliable energy. Nuclear power is currently the single largest carbon-free component of our electrical supply. One of my top priorities as a Member of Congress is preventing and mitigating the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. I believe that nuclear power can and should play a key role in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our electricity sector. But there currently are technical, economic, and policy challenges that prevent nuclear energy from playing a larger role in enabling our clean energy future. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act takes several positive steps to address these challenges. Implementing the provisions in this bill will help accelerate the development of advanced nuclear energy technologies that are safer, less expensive, more efficient, and produce less waste than the current generation of nuclear reactors. While the results of this research will clearly benefit the American consumers, it is my hope that it will also help spur American industry. As the world collectively moves towards greenhouse gas reductions, we need to make sure that American industry is ready to supply the technologies to fuel the world's low carbon future. This bill will help ensure that American industry will lead the world in supplying next generation nuclear power. I would like to express my appreciation for the process we followed to put this bill together. Majority and Minority staff worked closely together, from engaging stakeholders through crafting and incorporating suggested changes to bill language. This is a great example of what we can achieve when we leave politics at the door and look for common ground to address the challenges facing our nation's research enterprise. Specifically, I'd like to thank my Texas colleague Mr. Weber for sponsoring this legislation, and my other Texas colleague Chairman Smith for working with the Minority to advance this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4084, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,42165,42165,42235,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [house] [pages

chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. mr. weber of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 4084, the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act. i want to thank ranking member johnson and chairman smith for cosponsoring this important legislation and for their leadership in advocating for nuclear energy research and development. i am grateful for the opportunity to work with my fellow texans to guide research that will keep america safe, globally competitive, and support nuclear innovation. i also want to thank my colleagues on the science committee who cosponsored h.r. 4084. mr. speaker, the science committee has spent over a year examining u.s. nuclear energy policy and preparation for this legislation. we have been holding hearings on supercomputing, advanced nuclear energy technology, the nuclear regulatory commission, and the doe energy innovation hubs. witnesses from the national labs, universities, and the private sector have all testified in support of the various reforms and policies outlined in this bill. we took our time developing this legislation. by working together and listening to all the relevant stakeholders, we have developed broad bipartisan and bicameral support for this bill. we have worked with our colleagues in the senate to develop companion legislation as well. last month an amendment with the text of this legislation passed, mr. speaker, with historic overwhelming support in the senate. for the first time in many years, the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act will provide updated statutory direction to the department of energy's nuclear research activities to ensure that fundamental research is prioritized and precious resources are not wasted. this bill requires doe to leverage its supercomputing infrastructure and use modeling and simulation capabilities to develop advanced fission and fusion reactors. the bill lays out a clear timeline and parameters for doe to complete a research reactor. a research reactor is a crucial part of ensuring materials and nuclear fuels r&d can take place in the united states. this type of research requires access to fast neutrons, which, unfortunately, are currently only available for civilian research in russia, mr. speaker. while modeling and simulation can accelerate r&d, nuclear energy must be validated through a physical source. the versatile neutron source under section 6 of h.r. 4084 will provide the united states with that vital capability. {time} 1745 this legislation also directs doe to partner with the private sector to construct and operate reactor prototypes at doe national labs. nuclear reactors are expensive and highly regulated. designing a first-of-a-kind reactor requires a blend of creative freedom for engineers to test new designs while ensuring safety throughout the entire process. doe sites, particularly the doe national labs, can provide a unique environment that safely allows for this kind of creative testing and development for advanced nuclear technology, without a burdensome regulatory process which slows progress to a crawl. doe has fundamental authority to enter into these innovative research partnerships, but won't have the confidence to act without direction from congress, which is provided in this legislation, mr. speaker. america must maintain our nuclear capabilities and continue to develop cutting-edge technology right here at home. without the direction provided in this bill, we will continue to fall further and further behind, lose the ability to develop innovative nuclear technology, and be left importing reactor designs from overseas. today, we have the best nuclear engineers and manufacturing capacity in the world right here at home. we can't put that expertise at risk, mr. speaker. even more importantly, this bill will maintain america's capability to influence security and proliferation standards around the world, as more developing nations look to nuclear energy to grow their economies. as a member of the foreign affairs committee, i am constantly reminded of the need for american leadership in a dangerous world. h.r. 4084 reaffirms the united states' commitment to safely advancing nuclear technology. i encourage my colleagues to support this bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. [[page h1026]] mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 4084, the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act. currently in the united states, nuclear power produces about 20 percent of our nation's electrical supply, and that makes nuclear power the single largest carbon-free power source in the country. however, our current nuclear fleet is growing older. many of the plants across our country are many decades old and rely upon nuclear technology that is even older. there have been substantial efforts in the past decade to move towards constructing new nuclear generating units with more modern designs. however, these efforts have had mixed results. there have been construction difficulties, regulatory hurdles, and financing issues, all of which have conspired to delay the construction of new nuclear plants in america. some of these hurdles, though, are unlikely to go away with our current technologies. the three mile island, chernobyl, and fukushima nuclear accidents have repeatedly highlighted the necessity of ensuring our nuclear fleet runs as safely as possible. this has led to much of the cost and difficulty of building the new plants. i think the answer to these problems can be found in innovative new nuclear technologies. the department of energy and many different companies in the private sector are working on new forms of nuclear energy generation that hold the promise of much more effective and much safer nuclear generation stations. some of these technologies also address the extremely important issue of the radioactive waste streams that plague our current generation of nuclear plants. h.r. 4084 takes several positive steps to help spur this innovation and deliver these very promising nuclear technologies to market. i also want to highlight one additional reason to support h.r. 4084. as the world makes commitments to move toward a lower carbon future, as evidenced by the paris climate agreement, it presents an opportunity to american industry to supply low-carbon power platforms like nuclear power. this bill will keep our country on the forefront of nuclear power technology, and it is my hope it will empower american industry to be the suppliers of the next generation of nuclear plants throughout the entire world. mr. speaker, i would like to thank congressman weber for sponsoring this legislation, and thank science, space, and technology committee chairman smith and ranking member eddie bernice johnson for bringing this bill to the floor in such a bipartisan manner. mr. speaker, i reserve balance of my time. mr. weber of texas. i appreciate the gentleman's kind remarks. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. loudermilk). mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i thank my colleague from texas, mr. weber, for his leadership on this important issue and for allowing me a few moments to speak on it. h.r. 4084 is a critical piece of legislation that will improve our nation's nuclear energy research and foster the development of our next generation of nuclear reactors. throughout our history, the united states has led the world in developing new nuclear technologies, and this bill provides the tools to help us to continue this leadership into the future. one of the many important provisions of this bill is that it directs the department of energy, through its national laboratories, to develop new nuclear reactor concepts by partnering with the private sector. with a national population of 320 million, and growing, we must be aggressive in our pursuit of new nuclear breakthroughs in order to power our nation's future. as a member of congress from georgia, i understand the challenges of providing power to a rapidly growing population. georgia's population is expected to increase by almost 2 million over the next 10 years, and without clean, affordable, reliable nuclear power, the task of bringing electricity to these new residents would be daunting. the united states has not added any nuclear power generation for over 30 years. however, today, new power units are being built at plant vogtle in georgia. these nuclear power generators will add the capacity to power 1 million homes and businesses once they are completed. after visiting plant vogtle last year, i am confident that these new generators will reassure the country that nuclear power is safe, secure, and reliable, and will encourage the pursuit of future nuclear technology breakthroughs. this bill is vital to the future of our nation because it enables the private sector to utilize the research tools and resources at the doe national labs so scientists and engineers in the private sector can assist in the development of new nuclear technologies. nuclear power generation that is clean, sustainable, and safe, is what will power america's homes and businesses for years to come. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. weber of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. knight). mr. knight. mr. speaker, i thank mr. weber and mr. beyer for their congenial work on this issue. i do rise today in support of h.r. 4084, the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act, as i am a cosponsor. some of us believe a nuclear energy policy is important to the state of california, which is home to private companies and universities pursuing advanced nuclear technologies. i am proud to support this legislation because it would provide capabilities for our technology innovators to develop new reactors that will yield amazing benefits to society through increased resistance to proliferation, minimizing waste, and perhaps even consuming existing waste stockpiles. the possibilities are endless when we allow our engineers to creatively tackle the world's challenges, and this is no different for nuclear energy. this is important because in my district we have recently seen the issues that can arise when an area is dependent on a single energy source. california is home to many of the companies seeking to partner with the doe and benefit from our nation's unparalleled supercomputer capabilities. leveraging the department's assets will help our domestic industry capture a significant share of a growing, multibillion-dollar industry. mr. speaker, i include in the record letters of support from tri alpha, a california-based fusion company, and upower, a california- based advanced fission reactor company. tri alpha energy, february 24, 2016. hon. lamar smith, chairman, house science, space & technology committee, washington, dc. hon. eddie bernice johnson, ranking member, house science, space & technology committee, washington, dc. hon. randy weber, chairman, energy subcommittee, house science, space & technology committee, washington, dc. dear chairman smith, ranking member johnson, and representative weber: tri alpha energy is a fusion energy science research company headquartered in foothill ranch, california. our purpose is to deliver world-changing clean fusion energy for economical, commercial power generation as fast as possible. tri alpha started as a research project at the university of california-irvine in 1990. today we have 150 employees, over 350 patents issued or pending, and are conducting experiments on a state of the art plasma generation device. we are writing to express support for your bill h.r. 4084, the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act. global market and environmental conditions demand that new sources of clean, baseload electricity be developed. new nuclear designs hold tremendous promise as a sustainable and cost-competitive power solution, but the united states government must provide a favorable policy environment for the necessary technology developments to take place. h.r. 4084 would make several improvements at the department of energy to help move advanced nuclear technology concepts, including fusion, out of the laboratory and toward commercialization. the nuclear innovation center, for example, would enable shorter development and permitting timelines by allowing private companies to work hand-in-hand with federal researchers and regulators on design validation. we commend you and your staff for recognizing the enormous positive potential that advanced nuclear, including fusion, holds in [[page h1027]] the united states and for offering thoughtful, bipartisan legislation to move the industry forward. we hope that h.r. 4084 will be offered for floor consideration soon and offer our support to help move the bill to final passage. we also look forward to working with your committee on other fusion energy issues in the future. please contact me with any questions. sincerely, richard c. barth, ph.d., senior vice president, government relations, tri alpha energy. ____ january 22, 2016. hon. lamar smith, chairman, hon. eddie bernice johnson, ranking member, hon. randy weber, chairman, subcommittee on energy and the house committee on science, space, and technology. dear chairman smith, ranking member johnson, chairman weber, and senator whitehouse, senator booker, and senator risch: on behalf of upower technologies, i am writing to commend your bipartisan leadership and foresight regarding the creation and passage of h.r. 4084 and the senate companion which compose the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act (the act). upower technologies, inc., soon to become oklo, inc., is a funded advanced reactor startup based in silicon valley. we believe that what is good for all advanced nuclear is what's best for the individual companies as well, and in turn what is best for the industry is best for the nation. each entity in the advanced nuclear industry requires a high-functioning network of a diversity of companies, manufacturers, labs, suppliers, regulators, investors, and other expertise in order to thrive. and the united states will require this home-grown industry to be an international leader in clean energy, to provide high-paying, long-term jobs, and to provide clean power in a safe and reliable manner. your commendable work on the nuclear innovation capabilities act will support these important u.s. goals. the act is a start to look critically at potential ways that the u.s. government can be more efficient both in utilizing its vast, existing investments in infrastructure and expertise, and in removing unreasonable blocks to american innovation. the act begins to lay out an important framework and focus for the department of energy (doe) regarding advanced nuclear, especially regarding its relationship to industry. while the doe has many resources in place, such as a wealth of valuable advanced codes and computational resources, a congressional mandate to focus on making these resources more accessible, cost effective, and utilized could make both the doe complex and the advanced reactor industry more vibrant. the act also requires the doe to consider locations for nuclear fueled advanced reactor testing. it will be critical as this process proceeds to ensure that locations for implementations are not limited among the various potential doe sites and that fees and contracting are in line with reasonable costs and not compensating for irrelevant or excessive overhead. the act institutes a focus on having a fast reactor resource within the doe complex. it will be a valuable asset to both the doe and the industry. the laudable goal of the act is to streamline u.s. technology development to commercialization. as such, it will be critically important that the doe work as seamlessly as possible with the nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) as far as providing data and allowing for the licensing activities required for commercialization, so that there need not be a duplication of nuclear-fueled implementations--possibly an exorbitant cost for any startup to survive. the act also asks the nrc for a report on timeline expectations for advanced reactor licensing. from the perspective of current or future advanced nuclear startup companies, an official report on timelines creates better certainty for private investment. this is potentially a very valuable provision to encourage private investment to further this relatively new u.s. industry. we also encourage continued dialog between the nrc, industry, and other stakeholders regarding how the regulatory process can benefit from significant advances in safety, further reducing uncertainty and accelerating deployment of safe, clean energy. in summary, we support h.r. 4084 and the accompanying senate bill. we appreciate the focus it brings to key areas to utilize u.s. investments and infrastructure to enhance u.s. innovation in clean energy. we also look forward to future legislation which may add appropriation and clarification of public-private contracting to further enable american innovation. upower technologies stands ready to support these important advances in u.s. energy leadership. sincerely, jacob dewitte, ceo and founder, upower technologies, inc. (changing to oklo, inc.), sunnyvale, ca. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, having no further requests for time, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. weber of texas. mr. speaker, how much time do i have left? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas has 12 minutes remaining. general leave mr. weber of texas. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on h.r. 4084, the bill now under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas? there was no objection. mr. weber of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. h.r. 4084 is vital to ensuring america's leadership in nuclear innovation. by harnessing the expertise of our nation's national labs, some of which we heard about today, its universities and entrepreneurs, the private sector can take the lead in developing groundbreaking advanced nuclear technology. i especially want to thank my colleagues on the science, space, and technology committee; of course, ranking member eddie bernice johnson; those who have also cosponsored the bill, including dan lipinski, barry loudermilk, ed perlmutter, barbara comstock, paul tonko, jim bridenstine, brian babin, dana rohrabacher, randy hultgren, bruce westerman, steve knight, bill posey, frank lucas, randy neugebauer, and the gentleman from virginia for his kind remarks. i also want to thank the dozens and dozens of researchers and stakeholders who came in and provided feedback as we developed this legislation. mr. speaker, i include in the record a letter exchange between the energy and commerce committee and the science, space, and technology committee on h.r. 4084. house of representatives, committee on energy and commerce, washington, dc, february 29, 2016. hon. lamar smith, chairman, committee on science, space, and technology, washington, dc. dear chairman smith: i write in regard to h.r. 4084, the ``nuclear energy innovation capabilities act.'' as you are aware, the bill was referred to the committee on science, space, and technology, but the committee on energy and commerce has a jurisdictional interest in the bill. i wanted to notify you that the committee on energy and commerce will forgo action on h.r. 4084 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor for consideration. this is done with the understanding that the committee on energy and commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. in addition, the committee reserves the right to seek conferees on h.r. 4084 and requests your support when such a request is made. i would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to h.r. 4084 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during consideration of the bill on the house floor. sincerely, fred upton, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on science, space, and technology, washington, dc, february 29, 2016. hon. fred upton, chairman, committee on energy and commerce, washington, dc. dear mr. chairman: thank you for your letter regarding h.r. 4084, the ``nuclear energy innovation capabilities act.'' your support for this legislation and your assistance in ensuring its timely consideration are greatly appreciated. i agree that a provision in the bill is within the jurisdiction of the committee on energy and commerce. i acknowledge that by waiving rights to further consideration of h.r. 4084, your committee is not relinquishing its jurisdiction. a copy of our letters will be placed in the congressional record during consideration of the bill on the house floor. i value your cooperation and look forward to working with you as we move ahead with this legislation. sincerely, lamar smith, chairman. mr. weber of texas. mr. speaker, i urge adoption of this commonsense, bipartisan legislation. i appreciate my colleagues' help. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, h.r. 4084, the ``nuclear energy innovation capabilities act,'' directs civilian nuclear energy research and development to contribute to american nuclear power. [[page h1028]] i thank the energy subcommittee chairman, randy weber, and science committee ranking member, eddie bernice johnson of texas, for their leadership on this issue. i also want to thank many bipartisan cosponsors of the bill, which include science committee vice chairman frank lucas, research and technology subcommittee chairwoman barbara comstock and subcommittee ranking member dan lipinski, environment subcommittee chairman jim bridenstine, oversight subcommittee chairman barry loudermilk, space subcommittee chairman brian babin, and full committee members dana rohrabacher, ed perlmutter, randy hultgren, paul tonko, bruce westerman, steve knight, bill posey, and randy neugebauer. i am encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for the subsequently introduced senate version of the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act, which passed as an amendment to the energy policy modernization act by a vote of 87-4 on the senate floor in january. advanced nuclear energy technology is the best opportunity to make reliable, emission-free electricity available throughout the modern and developing world. america must maintain a strong nuclear technology sector in order to influence global nonproliferation standards. this will help us prevent civilian nuclear energy technology from being misused for weapons development overseas. h.r. 4084 harnesses the strengths of the department of energy (doe) national labs, universities, and the private sector. it ensures that america's best and brightest minds advance this groundbreaking science and technology. this legislation provides doe with the direction and certainty it needs to develop plans for long term research and infrastructure development within the office of nuclear energy. h.r. 4084 authorizes doe to take advantage of the national labs' supercomputers in order to accelerate research for advanced fission and fusion experimental reactors. this program will leverage expertise from the private sector, universities, and national labs. the bill provides a clear timeline for doe to complete a research reactor user facility within ten years. this research reactor will enable proprietary and academic research to develop supercomputing models and also design next generation nuclear energy technology. finally, h.r. 4084 creates a reliable mechanism for the private sector to partner with doe labs to build fission and fusion prototype reactors at doe sites. nuclear power has been a proven source of safe and emission-free electricity for over half a century. now, america's strategic investments in advanced nuclear reactor technology can play a more meaningful role to reduce global emissions. unfortunately, the ability to move innovative technology to the market has been stalled by government red tape. by working around these bureaucratic barriers, h.r. 4084 will spur american competitiveness and keep us on the forefront of nuclear energy technology. this legislation enables our talented engineers in the private sector, academia, and at the national labs to develop the next generation of nuclear technology here in the united states. nuclear energy can be a clean, cheap answer to an energy independent, pro-growth, secure future. i thank chairman weber and ranking member johnson of texas for their work on this bill and encourage my colleagues to support it. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i rise today to support h.r. 4084, the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act, which i am very pleased to co-sponsor. today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our country with clean, reliable energy. nuclear power is currently the single largest carbon-free component of our electrical supply. one of my top priorities as a member of congress is preventing and mitigating the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. i believe that nuclear power can and should play a key role in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our electricity sector. but there currently are technical, economic, and policy challenges that prevent nuclear energy from playing a larger role in enabling our clean energy future. the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act takes several positive steps to address these challenges. implementing the provisions in this bill will help accelerate the development of advanced nuclear energy technologies that are safer, less expensive, more efficient, and produce less waste than the current generation of nuclear reactors. while the results of this research will clearly benefit the

HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1580) to allow additional appointing authorities to select individuals from competitive service certificates, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1580 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1580, the Competitive Service Act of 2015, introduced by Senator Jon Tester of Montana. This bill will allow Federal agencies to share their lists of best qualified candidates with other agencies needing to hire for similar positions. Mr. Speaker, many applicants are reluctant to apply for jobs with the Federal Government due to the length of time it takes for some agencies to fill job announcements. This bill will expedite the Federal hiring process by allowing agencies to share their assessments of job applicants for competitive service positions. S. 1580 allows an agency to hire from another agency's certified list of eligible candidates as long as the original job announcement provided notice that the list of eligible candidates may be used by another agency, that the position is in the same occupational category, and that the position is at a similar grade level. However, before an agency can hire from another agency's certified list of eligible candidates, that agency must provide notice of the available position to its internal employees, give up to 10 business days for its employees to submit applications, and then consider those applications. S. 1580 provides that as long as all of these requirements are met, an agency does not need to make any additional postings and may hire from the list of certified eligible candidates. In an April 2014 report, titled, ``A New Civil Service Framework,'' the Partnership for Public Service discussed allowing agencies to share those best qualified candidates with other agencies. PPS notes that creating cross-agency best qualified applicant pools is ``another commonsense opportunity to create enterprisewide efficiencies for the Federal Government.'' With the Federal Government looking to fill critical vacancies, this bill will assist agencies with recruiting and hiring much-needed talent in areas such as cybersecurity and information technology. Mr. Speaker, the committee received letters of support for this legislation from the Professional Managers Association and the Partnership for Public Service. The Federal Managers Association also supports this bill, calling it commonsense legislation. I want to thank Senator Tester for this legislation. The House has a similar bill that was introduced by Representatives Connolly and Wittman, and I want to thank them also for bringing this matter to the attention of the committee as well. Mr. Speaker, as we move forward with legislation to make the Federal Government more effective and efficient, I urge my colleagues to support this important, bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1580, the Competitive Service Act of 2015. I commend Senators Tester and Portman and other colleagues in the Senate for their leadership on this important legislation. I also want to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Connolly of Virginia, for his work on this bill and introducing the companion bill in the House. S. 1580 is a commonsense measure to streamline the Federal Government's hiring process. The legislation would reduce duplication in the vetting of candidates for Federal jobs by allowing agencies to share their list of best qualified candidates with other agencies that are hiring for a similar position. Under this bill, an agency may hire an individual from another agency's certified list of candidates without any additional job posting if the agency meets certain requirements, including notifying its employees of the available position and allowing them to apply. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman). He has been a major player in this legislation. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding and thank him for his leadership. As you have heard, this is just a commonsense bill, and I rise in strong support of S. 1580, the Competitive Services Act. I want to thank my colleague from Virginia, Gerry Connolly, for his effort, along with my staff, in putting together the House version of this bill. It is just a commonsense, bicameral, and bipartisan bill that allows agencies in a very complex and competitive world to aggressively and timely recruit individuals for these positions. We want to get individuals into those positions quickly, and we want to understand where the talent lies so that these agencies can communicate back [[Page H1033]] and forth. Many times that silo approach doesn't work. This breaks down those silos and allows agencies to share information about these applicants. In today's world when we need to, in a timely way, gets folks into the cybersecurity realm, we need to get folks into the information technology realm, and even in the veterans' healthcare realm where we need to get healthcare providers there quickly, especially when there is demand, this is the perfect way to do that. When we go through the effort of having these individuals apply for these jobs, we know what their qualifications are. There is no reason why we shouldn't be sharing this information. It allows us to act in the best interests of taxpayers, it cuts down on the amount of expense that is put forth in recruiting these individuals, and it ensures that we get things done on time. We understand, too, the talent pool that is out there. Many times, too, if you look at it and say that these are the individuals who are available and even if there is a challenge in getting somebody, you can immediately see that, instead of having to wait for time to communicate back and forth between agencies and say, ``Well, it doesn't look like in this area that we have the number of individuals that we need; what is the next course of action?'' this allows us to get through all of those particular issues and get people in these positions as quickly as possible. It is just a commonsense piece of legislation that allows our managers to manage in the most effective way possible. It allows us to do the best job for our country, and it allows the best use of taxpayers' dollars. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1580. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. I urge adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my strong support for the bipartisan, bicameral Competitive Service Act, S. 1580, before the House today. I am pleased to sponsor the House companion, H.R. 2827, of this common-sense legislation with my fellow Virginian, Rob Wittman. Our bill reforms an antiquated and cumbersome hiring system that hinders our nation's ability to efficiently hire the most qualified candidates into federal service. Under current law, federal agencies are prohibited from sharing information about vetted job applicants. For example, when agencies identify finalists for a vacant position in a highly competitive field, such as cybersecurity, no other agency can leverage those efforts and take advantage of applicant screening that's already been performed. Our bill will empower agencies to share information about the most qualified candidates, allowing the federal government to effectively recruit the best and the brightest talent while saving taxpayer dollars. It represents a win-win for applicants and agency human resource professionals. Further this is an important component of a comprehensive effort to modernize the federal hiring process to ensure we can recruit the next generation of civil servants. We are facing a retirement bubble within the federal ranks. Last year, GAO reported that nearly one-third of the federal workforce would be eligible to retire by the end of fiscal year 2017. We need to begin repairing the significant-damage that has been wrought on federal employees. The perception of public service, once lionized by President Kennedy as a noble profession, has steadily been whittled away by the current House majority, which has cut federal pay and benefits. Just try to go to a college campus today and convince a young graduate that they have a promising future federal service. The relaunch of the USAJobs site later this week is another critical tool that will make the application process more user-friendly and transparent. Our Competitive Service Act will ensure all agencies have ready access to those qualified individuals once they're in the system. I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1580, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1031-H1033] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPETITIVE SERVICE ACT OF 2015 Mr. JODY B.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1580, the Competitive Service Act of 2015, introduced by Senator Jon Tester of Montana. This bill will allow Federal agencies to share their lists of best qualified candidates with other agencies needing to hire for similar positions. Mr. Speaker, many applicants are reluctant to apply for jobs with the Federal Government due to the length of time it takes for some agencies to fill job announcements. This bill will expedite the Federal hiring process by allowing agencies to share their assessments of job applicants for competitive service positions. S. 1580 allows an agency to hire from another agency's certified list of eligible candidates as long as the original job announcement provided notice that the list of eligible candidates may be used by another agency, that the position is in the same occupational category, and that the position is at a similar grade level. However, before an agency can hire from another agency's certified list of eligible candidates, that agency must provide notice of the available position to its internal employees, give up to 10 business days for its employees to submit applications, and then consider those applications. S. 1580 provides that as long as all of these requirements are met, an agency does not need to make any additional postings and may hire from the list of certified eligible candidates. In an April 2014 report, titled, ``A New Civil Service Framework,'' the Partnership for Public Service discussed allowing agencies to share those best qualified candidates with other agencies. PPS notes that creating cross-agency best qualified applicant pools is ``another commonsense opportunity to create enterprisewide efficiencies for the Federal Government.'' With the Federal Government looking to fill critical vacancies, this bill will assist agencies with recruiting and hiring much-needed talent in areas such as cybersecurity and information technology. Mr. Speaker, the committee received letters of support for this legislation from the Professional Managers Association and the Partnership for Public Service. The Federal Managers Association also supports this bill, calling it commonsense legislation. I want to thank Senator Tester for this legislation. The House has a similar bill that was introduced by Representatives Connolly and Wittman, and I want to thank them also for bringing this matter to the attention of the committee as well. Mr. Speaker, as we move forward with legislation to make the Federal Government more effective and efficient, I urge my colleagues to support this important, bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1580, the Competitive Service Act of 2015. I commend Senators Tester and Portman and other colleagues in the Senate for their leadership on this important legislation. I also want to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Connolly of Virginia, for his work on this bill and introducing the companion bill in the House. S. 1580 is a commonsense measure to streamline the Federal Government's hiring process. The legislation would reduce duplication in the vetting of candidates for Federal jobs by allowing agencies to share their list of best qualified candidates with other agencies that are hiring for a similar position. Under this bill, an agency may hire an individual from another agency's certified list of candidates without any additional job posting if the agency meets certain requirements, including notifying its employees of the available position and allowing them to apply. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman). He has been a major player in this legislation. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding and thank him for his leadership. As you have heard, this is just a commonsense bill, and I rise in strong support of S. 1580, the Competitive Services Act. I want to thank my colleague from Virginia, Gerry Connolly, for his effort, along with my staff, in putting together the House version of this bill. It is just a commonsense, bicameral, and bipartisan bill that allows agencies in a very complex and competitive world to aggressively and timely recruit individuals for these positions. We want to get individuals into those positions quickly, and we want to understand where the talent lies so that these agencies can communicate back [[Page H1033]] and forth. Many times that silo approach doesn't work. This breaks down those silos and allows agencies to share information about these applicants. In today's world when we need to, in a timely way, gets folks into the cybersecurity realm, we need to get folks into the information technology realm, and even in the veterans' healthcare realm where we need to get healthcare providers there quickly, especially when there is demand, this is the perfect way to do that. When we go through the effort of having these individuals apply for these jobs, we know what their qualifications are. There is no reason why we shouldn't be sharing this information. It allows us to act in the best interests of taxpayers, it cuts down on the amount of expense that is put forth in recruiting these individuals, and it ensures that we get things done on time. We understand, too, the talent pool that is out there. Many times, too, if you look at it and say that these are the individuals who are available and even if there is a challenge in getting somebody, you can immediately see that, instead of having to wait for time to communicate back and forth between agencies and say, ``Well, it doesn't look like in this area that we have the number of individuals that we need; what is the next course of action?'' this allows us to get through all of those particular issues and get people in these positions as quickly as possible. It is just a commonsense piece of legislation that allows our managers to manage in the most effective way possible. It allows us to do the best job for our country, and it allows the best use of taxpayers' dollars. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1580. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. I urge adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my strong support for the bipartisan, bicameral Competitive Service Act, S. 1580, before the House today. I am pleased to sponsor the House companion, H.R. 2827, of this common-sense legislation with my fellow Virginian, Rob Wittman. Our bill reforms an antiquated and cumbersome hiring system that hinders our nation's ability to efficiently hire the most qualified candidates into federal service. Under current law, federal agencies are prohibited from sharing information about vetted job applicants. For example, when agencies identify finalists for a vacant position in a highly competitive field, such as cybersecurity, no other agency can leverage those efforts and take advantage of applicant screening that's already been performed. Our bill will empower agencies to share information about the most qualified candidates, allowing the federal government to effectively recruit the best and the brightest talent while saving taxpayer dollars. It represents a win-win for applicants and agency human resource professionals. Further this is an important component of a comprehensive effort to modernize the federal hiring process to ensure we can recruit the next generation of civil servants. We are facing a retirement bubble within the federal ranks. Last year, GAO reported that nearly one-third of the federal workforce would be eligible to retire by the end of fiscal year 2017. We need to begin repairing the significant-damage that has been wrought on federal employees. The perception of public service, once lionized by President Kennedy as a noble profession, has steadily been whittled away by the current House majority, which has cut federal pay and benefits. Just try to go to a college campus today and convince a young graduate that they have a promising future federal service. The relaunch of the USAJobs site later this week is another critical tool that will make the application process more user-friendly and transparent. Our Competitive Service Act will ensure all agencies have ready access to those qualified individuals once they're in the system. I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1580, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,15737,15737,15807,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [house] [pages h1031-h1033] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] competitive service act of 2015 mr. jody b. hice of georgia. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (s. 1580) to allow additional appointing authorities to select individuals from competitive service certificates, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: s. 1580 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``competitive service act of 2015''. sec. 2. additional appointing authorities for competitive service.

The FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act has two primary goals: to help save lives and to save taxpayer money. {time} 1715 The bill helps save lives by fixing a longstanding problem that hinders the deployment of critical search and rescue teams between States. These reforms will help ensure our constituents receive the help they need when disaster strikes. Additionally, this bill helps save money by improving the cost- effectiveness of FEMA's existing disaster assistance programs. For example, there are provisions that will speed up reconstruction and lower administrative costs. The bill also saves money by encouraging smart recovery practices and mitigation to lower the costs of the next disaster. The bill commissions a comprehensive review of the growing disaster losses the Nation has experienced over the past decades. Experts estimated over $1 trillion of disaster losses have occurred in North America since 1980. FEMA alone has spent almost $200 billion on over 1300 major Presidential disaster declarations since 1989. These numbers are going up, and we should try to find ways to bring those costs down over time. It has been over 20 years since we have had a comprehensive look at disaster spending. It is time for a big picture assessment of what is driving these costs and to review if we, as a Nation, are responding in the most appropriate and cost-effective way. Right after I became a Member of Congress, my district was hit hard by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. I saw homes destroyed, lives and livelihoods upset. Disaster relief is critical at times like these, and people need help to rebuild their lives and rebuild their communities. As I witnessed the recovery, I was amazed that folks were rebuilding back in the very same place, in the very same way, leaving themselves just as vulnerable to the next storm. We have to be compassionate and responsive to our citizens, but we also have a duty to be a good steward of the taxpayer dollars. I am committed to establishing this study to see if we can tackle these tough issues and find solutions that are driven by facts and data rather than the emotion that inevitably follows a disaster. These reforms are one of my top priorities this Congress. At the end of the day, the purpose of this bill is to ensure help will be there when disaster strikes and our constituents need that help the most. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Act of 2015. I appreciate your willingness to support expediting the consideration of this legislation on the House Floor. I acknowledge that by waiving consideration of this bill, the Committee on the Judiciary does not waive any future valid jurisdictional claim to provisions in this or similar legislation.

I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation, and I look forward to working with the Committee on the Judiciary as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan measure before us today. H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015, as amended, contains several provisions important to State and local governments and emergency managers. I will only highlight a few of them. I also want to acknowledge Chairman Barletta and my good friend, Ranking Member DeFazio. Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, the most important aspect of this bill is that it clarifies compensation and liability issues for urban search and rescue team members. These members provide critical services and put themselves in harm's way to help others involved in a disaster. In Indianapolis, my city, our own urban search and rescue team, which consists of firefighters, paramedics, civilians, and others responded to Hurricane Sandy. They did so despite the uncertainties that they would be covered for any injuries. These protections, Mr. Speaker, are long overdue. Team members can now rest assured that they will be taken care of when activated for Federal service if they are injured. Another important provision grows out of the individual States' and local governments' need to know that they can rely on FEMA's decisions and reimbursement amounts. Local governments make major decisions during the disaster recovery phase in reliance on FEMA's initial approval. There comes a time, Mr. Speaker, when FEMA should not be able to reverse its initial decisions or award amounts. Statute of limitations protections for individuals, States, and local governments will provide peace of mind and certainty needed to go forward with the recovery process. Climate change, Mr. Speaker, is causing more extreme weather patterns. So in order for us to become more resilient, we must encourage more local governments, communities to undertake mitigation measures. Some communities may forgo mitigation actions because they do not have the capacity to administer the funds. Ensuring that local governments will be reimbursed for management costs should help us all obtain more resilient communities. Finally, Mr. Speaker, our subcommittee has embarked on discussions related to the trends and causes of rising disaster costs and losses. In furtherance of this discussion, the bill requires FEMA's National Advisory Council to study the issue and make recommendations to Congress and address causes and trends. Specifically, the bill requires the Council to examine mechanisms and incentives to promote mitigation and to make recommendations regarding the same. The last few years, Mr. Speaker, I have introduced a bill to reauthorize the disaster mitigation program. Mr. Speaker, mitigation saves taxpayer funds over the long haul. I look forward to any recommendations from the National Advisory Council on how we can strengthen this available and very effective program. I want to thank Chairman Barletta again and Ranking Member DeFazio for their leadership on this very important measure. As an original cosponsor of this measure, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting H.R. 1471. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who knows very well how important these disaster programs are when disasters have struck his State of Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. FEMA's disaster declaration process is broken. You don't need to look any further than the State of Illinois to see how FEMA's aid formula is failing the hardworking families of this country because it simply doesn't put all communities on a level playing field. In 2012, Harrisburg, Illinois, was denied Federal assistance following tornadoes that swept across the Midwest, while Missouri and Kentucky received it. Recently, towns like Gifford and Washington in central Illinois were denied public assistance as well. FEMA currently takes into account several factors when determining the need for public and individual assistance. However, there currently is no standard to determine which factor is more important than another, which leads to highly subjective and uncertain processes that leave States and communities in limbo for weeks as their application is considered. By working with this committee and this subcommittee that Chairman Barletta chairs, we were able to include language that was based on a bill that I introduced with many of my colleagues that requires the administrator of FEMA, when making recommendations to the President regarding a major disaster declaration, to give greater weight and consideration to localized impact. Consideration of this important legislation is timely for my home State of Illinois. Just days ago, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner submitted a request to President Obama asking him to declare a major disaster for Illinois following the extensive holiday flooding that we saw right at about the new year. Much of this damage happened in my home county of Christian County, where four people tragically lost their lives after encountering flood waters. Sadly, two of the deceased, Brandon Mann and Devan Everett, were from my hometown of Taylorville. Certainly no amount of resources can compensate for the loss of human life when disaster strikes, and yet these communities still need to rebuild. Preliminary damage assessments determined that communities in Illinois experienced $15 million in damages. Unfortunately, that doesn't meet FEMA's $18.1 million threshold. Mr. Speaker, it is just not right that States like Illinois, where a significant portion of the population is concentrated in a single area, can be denied disaster relief because of an arbitrary formula developed by bureaucrats in concrete buildings right here in Washington, D.C. That is what makes this bill and my provision so important. It levels the playing field. It tells rural America that, when disaster [[Page H1022]] strikes, we are going to look out for you, too. Mr. Speaker, I come from rural America. I know these people. These are not the type of people who expect help, who expect Washington to solve their problems; but we as Members of Congress and as Americans have an obligation to commit that we will be there for them when they need us and that we won't let arbitrary formulas prevent that help from being delivered. We need this bill. We need these reforms. It will make a difference. Thank you again to Chairman Barletta, Chairman Shuster, and the ranking members. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my good friend and ranking member. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member of the subcommittee, for yielding, and I thank him for his excellent work on this bill, as I do the subcommittee chair and the full committee chairman. This is a bill very much in the tradition of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure where, in fact, we have come together and put together a bipartisan proposal to reauthorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a critical, critical agency, as you have heard from some of the previous speakers. In particular, in the West, we have some issues regarding wildfires. We had the worst wildfire season on record last year: 10 million acres burned; half the Forest Service budget went to fighting these wildfires. The perversity of that is that, when astounding amounts of money like that are required from the Forest Service, the Forest Service has to reduce other budgets, including preventative activities, particularly fuel reduction and other activities that would prevent future fires. So we are on this endless cycle that should end. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't end that. I hope that happens later in the Congress. There is legislation pending in both the House and the Senate that we have come close to moving that would deal with declaring that catastrophic fires are disasters, just like tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, et cetera. In this bill, we did make some progress. It makes State and private lands eligible for hazard mitigation assistance after wildfires. It is a commonsense solution to save on future disaster costs and losses. The bill also encourages States to direct the funds to the areas that experienced the wildfire. I thank our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz), for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. You have a fire, and particularly in California and elsewhere you have potential for catastrophic mudslides, future catastrophes, putting the public at risk. Hazard mitigation assistance on wildfires on State and private lands, encouraging wildfire mitigation, such as reducing hazardous fuels, and reseeding ground cover will help reduce the costs of future disasters. Further, there are other provisions in this legislation that deal with the potential for catastrophic earthquake and tsunami. The Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of Oregon, northern California has generated at least 12 major, great earthquakes, magnitude 8 to 9, yet we are woefully unprepared in terms of any sorts of early detection. We have just begun the rudiments with some Federal assistance of a land-based early detection system. We need an ocean-based early detection system, such as the Japanese have deployed. Early warning of quakes and tsunamis will save many lives on the coast of Oregon, Washington, and northern California. It will also save tremendous amounts in terms of infrastructure in the inland and more distant areas where they would have ample warning to shut down transit systems, get people off bridges, stop elevators in high-rise buildings, and otherwise accommodate the public, preventing more loss of life and also more catastrophic problems. Again, Japan is far, far ahead of us. They can and have stopped their high-speed rail trains when they have distant warning of a coming tremor. Even though the tremors move quickly through the Earth, there is enough time to slow or stop those trains. They have had time to evacuate the coastal areas. Although, unfortunately, in the last quake, when they reestimated the size of the tsunami, they found out communications were down. Now they have taken care of this. Now they have moved to a cellular-based network to notify people the tsunami is coming and to get them to high ground. So we can and should do a lot more there. This bill opens the door to those sorts of programs here in the United States of America. Finally, it gives assurances--well, two more points--to State and local governments they will be reimbursed up to a certain amount for costs incurred during disaster recovery. {time} 1730 This will encourage local governments to undertake new mitigation projects, which is a good deal for both the Federal Government and for taxpayers. Mitigation saves $3 to $4 for every dollar invested. Finally, we have a power play by a minor Federal agency attempting to make FEMA become the national land use planning agency of the United States, trying to force FEMA to deny flood insurance to States that don't follow the directives of the National Marine Fisheries Service. This is not authorized by law. They are way out of line, unfortunately. I talked to the woman who is head of that agency. She disagrees. Her regional representative is hell-bent to become the land use planning agency for Oregon, although, of course, it already has comprehensive land use planning, unlike his home State of Washington, which was not subjected to these dramatic changes in law. We are making it clear that that is not the authority of FEMA in this bill. That is a reasonable position. It is a bipartisan position. I thank my colleague and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their help. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), who was very helpful in adding very important language that strengthened this bill. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, in August of 2013, the southern portion of my district experienced a major disaster involving heavy flooding, which devastated infrastructure and caused significant hardship to many of my constituents. Unfortunately, the Federal recovery efforts to this devastated region added insult to injury. Local officials dealt with multiple teams conducting duplicative site visits due to lost paperwork, inconsistent messages between various survey and evaluation teams, and unnecessarily long delays in recovery and reimbursement. Such a response to any disaster is unacceptable, and change is necessary. Last year I introduced a bill to address the shortcomings of the FEMA response to the 2013 flooding in my district to ensure future disaster recoveries in Missouri and elsewhere are as painless and efficient as possible. My bill, which is included in this reform package, requires FEMA to create an action plan to address inconsistent guidance, inappropriate recordkeeping procedures, and overall mixed assistance to local officials. Additionally, it directs FEMA to issue a forward-looking report to identify new technologies that further aid the disaster workforce in partnering with private nonprofits as well as State and local governments in the wake of a disaster or emergency. FEMA processes need to be streamlined and consistent in order to help those recovering from a disaster feel supported and assured the relief will come in a timely, efficient manner. I rise today in full support of H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act. Making sure Federal agencies have the proper oversight and resources they need is an important function of the U.S. Congress. This 3-year reauthorization is a shining example of a bipartisan, commonsense effort to make the people get the help and assistance they so desperately need in times of crisis. I want to thank the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Barletta, and the ranking member for including my language in the FEMA reform package. I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1471. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), [[Page H1023]] my good friend and a member of the committee. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for their fine work. The bill contains a bipartisan provision which I had the honor of working on with my friend and colleague from Florida, Congressman Dan Webster. As Floridians, we know hurricanes. In 2004 and 2005, Charley, Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, and Katrina tore through our State, leaving families stranded and property damaged. Trees crashed to the ground, ripping power lines and blocking flooded streets. Water systems were compromised. Our local governments did a miraculous job cleaning debris from public ways, fixing broken infrastructure, and getting life back to normal. It takes a lot to get this done. When hurricanes strike, communities are ravaged and so are their budgets. So I want to thank FEMA for the funding assistance it provided Florida at a time of great stress and need. Now FEMA is asking some of our cities and counties to pay back money that they were given for disaster relief projects that were approved more than 10 years ago. But here is the thing. There is no question that FEMA should do responsible audits of its relief payments to make sure that money was used properly. But unless there is fraud, the process should not be an endless journey into the Federal bureaucracy. Our local governments, unlike the Federal Government, have to balance their budgets. They can't afford to wait 5, 10, or an infinite number of years for FEMA to do its assessment, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Simply said, the current practice unfairly stymies our local governments' ability to plan their future budgets. This legislation will make sure that the process is more balanced, giving FEMA adequate time to review its grant payments while allowing for financial security to local governments. I urge my colleagues to support this very good legislation. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who spent a lot of time and worked very hard to make this bill better. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the reality, as the gentleman from Indiana noted earlier, is that we are going to have disasters and we are going to spend funds responding to those disasters. The problem with the United States disaster management policy is that it is backward. It is entirely reactive. Rather than going in before a disaster happens and making areas more resilient, making our ecosytem more resilient, making our economy more resilient, we are dead set on this process of coming in after disasters and spending exponentially more dollars. The ranking member referenced a few figures a little while ago. He referenced a figure of a CBO study indicating that, for every $1 we invest in the right type of hazard mitigation, we save $3 in disaster response cost. There was another study that FEMA did. For every $1 we invest, we have $4 in cost savings. I think, Mr. Speaker, with the right criteria, you actually even save more. Now, we are challenged as a Nation right now because the agency that is primarily responsible for making our communities more resilient is the U.S. Army Corps Engineers, which, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, is stuck on stupid. What we have seen over the last several years is, rather than trying to fix that, we have seen other agencies coming up being granting agencies. We have seen FEMA. This year we have seen the Department of the Interior in the President's budget. In the recent years, we have seen HUD. Rather than fixing the problem, we are just trying to go around it and put more granting agencies out there. It is creating a disparate approach, an approach that is not coordinated and an approach that is going to result in more taxpayers' funds being spent on the wrong projects, the wrong priorities, rather than being proactive. This bill addresses that, Mr. Speaker. This bill actually incudes a provision that has FEMA begin developing a coordinated, proactive approach to how we mitigate or reduce vulnerabilities from disasters. In the last several years, in my home State of Louisiana, we have seen extraordinary disasters, whether it is Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 or Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. We had the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2011. In 2012, we had Hurricane Isaac. In 2011 and again this year, we saw record-high water on the Mississippi River system causing flooding. We are going to spend dollars. We have got to spend them in the right and principled places. This bill does a number of things that are important. Number one, it eliminates bureaucracy and helps to streamline the process of getting dollars on the ground to some of our important impacted areas. We have seen where this bill comes in and it actually changes criteria, where severely impacted local communities, like in Louisiana, where we just saw St. John Parish, Ascension Parish, Livingston Parish, the area of Kenner, and St. James Parish experience extraordinary impacts from tornadoes. Those areas actually could potentially qualify for Federal disaster because of the severe impacts in some of these limited areas. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for working with us on a provision that prevents FEMA from being able to move the goalpost on us, being able to come and change conditions after a grant is made that could result in homeowners having to pay back absurd amounts of money when they followed the criteria and followed the commitments when they entered into these grant agreements. Mr. Speaker, this bill goes a long way. I want to continue working with the leaders of this bill on these zones, on duplication of efforts, and other things. But I will say it again, Mr. Speaker: we are going to spend the money one way or another. We need to spend it in a principled manner. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues for passing H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015. This important legislation authorizes appropriations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency for FY2016-FY2018 for management and administration. It also, directs FEMA, through the National Advisory Council, to undertake and report on a comprehensive study of disaster costs and losses. H.R. 1471 includes provisions that I introduced that extends the authority of FEMA's Administrator to waive debts associated with an overpayment of individual assistance, so long as the overpayment was not a result of fraud. This issue received national attention when about 30 residents at the Belle Harbor Manor, an assisted living facility in my district, received collection notices related to assistance provided by FEMA in the aftermath of Super Storm Sandy. FEMA's Administrator, Craig Fugate, later cancelled their debts. However, he is limited in canceling the debts of others who are in the exact same situation. H.R. 1471 fixes this and provides FEMA's Administrator with expanded authority to waive debts of thousands of Super Storm Sandy survivors, as well as the debts incurred as a result of future natural disasters. I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Lou Barletta and Representative Peter DeFazio, for their assistance in developing this language. I would also like to thank New York State Assemblyman Phillip Goldfeder for his tireless advocacy on behalf of Super Storm Sandy victims. It is my hope that this measure will receive speedy passage in the Senate so it can be signed by President Obama, and survivors of Super Storm Sandy can finally recover for this horrific act of God. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1471, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1015-H1023] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEMA DISASTER ASSISTANCE REFORM ACT OF 2015 Mr. BARLETTA.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1471, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shuster for his tremendous support and leadership on this bill. Few Members of Congress have had a greater impact on reforming our disaster programs since Hurricane Katrina than Chairman Shuster. This bill represents another important step in that effort, and I greatly appreciate the chairman's help. I also want to thank Ranking Member DeFazio and Ranking Member Carson for their bipartisan support of the bill. The FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act has two primary goals: to help save lives and to save taxpayer money. {time} 1715 The bill helps save lives by fixing a longstanding problem that hinders the deployment of critical search and rescue teams between States. These reforms will help ensure our constituents receive the help they need when disaster strikes. Additionally, this bill helps save money by improving the cost- effectiveness of FEMA's existing disaster assistance programs. For example, there are provisions that will speed up reconstruction and lower administrative costs. The bill also saves money by encouraging smart recovery practices and mitigation to lower the costs of the next disaster. The bill commissions a comprehensive review of the growing disaster losses the Nation has experienced over the past decades. Experts estimated over $1 trillion of disaster losses have occurred in North America since 1980. FEMA alone has spent almost $200 billion on over 1300 major Presidential disaster declarations since 1989. These numbers are going up, and we should try to find ways to bring those costs down over time. It has been over 20 years since we have had a comprehensive look at disaster spending. It is time for a big picture assessment of what is driving these costs and to review if we, as a Nation, are responding in the most appropriate and cost-effective way. Right after I became a Member of Congress, my district was hit hard by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. I saw homes destroyed, lives and livelihoods upset. Disaster relief is critical at times like these, and people need help to rebuild their lives and rebuild their communities. As I witnessed the recovery, I was amazed that folks were rebuilding back in the very same place, in the very same way, leaving themselves just as vulnerable to the next storm. We have to be compassionate and responsive to our citizens, but we also have a duty to be a good steward of the taxpayer dollars. I am committed to establishing this study to see if we can tackle these tough issues and find solutions that are driven by facts and data rather than the emotion that inevitably follows a disaster. These reforms are one of my top priorities this Congress. At the end of the day, the purpose of this bill is to ensure help will be there when disaster strikes and our constituents need that help the most. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Act of 2015. I appreciate your willingness to support expediting the consideration of this legislation on the House Floor. I acknowledge that by waiving consideration of this bill, the Committee on the Judiciary does not waive any future valid jurisdictional claim to provisions in this or similar legislation.

I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation, and I look forward to working with the Committee on the Judiciary as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan measure before us today. H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015, as amended, contains several provisions important to State and local governments and emergency managers. I will only highlight a few of them. I also want to acknowledge Chairman Barletta and my good friend, Ranking Member DeFazio. Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, the most important aspect of this bill is that it clarifies compensation and liability issues for urban search and rescue team members. These members provide critical services and put themselves in harm's way to help others involved in a disaster. In Indianapolis, my city, our own urban search and rescue team, which consists of firefighters, paramedics, civilians, and others responded to Hurricane Sandy. They did so despite the uncertainties that they would be covered for any injuries. These protections, Mr. Speaker, are long overdue. Team members can now rest assured that they will be taken care of when activated for Federal service if they are injured. Another important provision grows out of the individual States' and local governments' need to know that they can rely on FEMA's decisions and reimbursement amounts. Local governments make major decisions during the disaster recovery phase in reliance on FEMA's initial approval. There comes a time, Mr. Speaker, when FEMA should not be able to reverse its initial decisions or award amounts. Statute of limitations protections for individuals, States, and local governments will provide peace of mind and certainty needed to go forward with the recovery process. Climate change, Mr. Speaker, is causing more extreme weather patterns. So in order for us to become more resilient, we must encourage more local governments, communities to undertake mitigation measures. Some communities may forgo mitigation actions because they do not have the capacity to administer the funds. Ensuring that local governments will be reimbursed for management costs should help us all obtain more resilient communities. Finally, Mr. Speaker, our subcommittee has embarked on discussions related to the trends and causes of rising disaster costs and losses. In furtherance of this discussion, the bill requires FEMA's National Advisory Council to study the issue and make recommendations to Congress and address causes and trends. Specifically, the bill requires the Council to examine mechanisms and incentives to promote mitigation and to make recommendations regarding the same. The last few years, Mr. Speaker, I have introduced a bill to reauthorize the disaster mitigation program. Mr. Speaker, mitigation saves taxpayer funds over the long haul. I look forward to any recommendations from the National Advisory Council on how we can strengthen this available and very effective program. I want to thank Chairman Barletta again and Ranking Member DeFazio for their leadership on this very important measure. As an original cosponsor of this measure, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting H.R. 1471. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who knows very well how important these disaster programs are when disasters have struck his State of Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. FEMA's disaster declaration process is broken. You don't need to look any further than the State of Illinois to see how FEMA's aid formula is failing the hardworking families of this country because it simply doesn't put all communities on a level playing field. In 2012, Harrisburg, Illinois, was denied Federal assistance following tornadoes that swept across the Midwest, while Missouri and Kentucky received it. Recently, towns like Gifford and Washington in central Illinois were denied public assistance as well. FEMA currently takes into account several factors when determining the need for public and individual assistance. However, there currently is no standard to determine which factor is more important than another, which leads to highly subjective and uncertain processes that leave States and communities in limbo for weeks as their application is considered. By working with this committee and this subcommittee that Chairman Barletta chairs, we were able to include language that was based on a bill that I introduced with many of my colleagues that requires the administrator of FEMA, when making recommendations to the President regarding a major disaster declaration, to give greater weight and consideration to localized impact. Consideration of this important legislation is timely for my home State of Illinois. Just days ago, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner submitted a request to President Obama asking him to declare a major disaster for Illinois following the extensive holiday flooding that we saw right at about the new year. Much of this damage happened in my home county of Christian County, where four people tragically lost their lives after encountering flood waters. Sadly, two of the deceased, Brandon Mann and Devan Everett, were from my hometown of Taylorville. Certainly no amount of resources can compensate for the loss of human life when disaster strikes, and yet these communities still need to rebuild. Preliminary damage assessments determined that communities in Illinois experienced $15 million in damages. Unfortunately, that doesn't meet FEMA's $18.1 million threshold. Mr. Speaker, it is just not right that States like Illinois, where a significant portion of the population is concentrated in a single area, can be denied disaster relief because of an arbitrary formula developed by bureaucrats in concrete buildings right here in Washington, D.C. That is what makes this bill and my provision so important. It levels the playing field. It tells rural America that, when disaster [[Page H1022]] strikes, we are going to look out for you, too. Mr. Speaker, I come from rural America. I know these people. These are not the type of people who expect help, who expect Washington to solve their problems; but we as Members of Congress and as Americans have an obligation to commit that we will be there for them when they need us and that we won't let arbitrary formulas prevent that help from being delivered. We need this bill. We need these reforms. It will make a difference. Thank you again to Chairman Barletta, Chairman Shuster, and the ranking members. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my good friend and ranking member. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member of the subcommittee, for yielding, and I thank him for his excellent work on this bill, as I do the subcommittee chair and the full committee chairman. This is a bill very much in the tradition of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure where, in fact, we have come together and put together a bipartisan proposal to reauthorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a critical, critical agency, as you have heard from some of the previous speakers. In particular, in the West, we have some issues regarding wildfires. We had the worst wildfire season on record last year: 10 million acres burned; half the Forest Service budget went to fighting these wildfires. The perversity of that is that, when astounding amounts of money like that are required from the Forest Service, the Forest Service has to reduce other budgets, including preventative activities, particularly fuel reduction and other activities that would prevent future fires. So we are on this endless cycle that should end. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't end that. I hope that happens later in the Congress. There is legislation pending in both the House and the Senate that we have come close to moving that would deal with declaring that catastrophic fires are disasters, just like tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, et cetera. In this bill, we did make some progress. It makes State and private lands eligible for hazard mitigation assistance after wildfires. It is a commonsense solution to save on future disaster costs and losses. The bill also encourages States to direct the funds to the areas that experienced the wildfire. I thank our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz), for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. You have a fire, and particularly in California and elsewhere you have potential for catastrophic mudslides, future catastrophes, putting the public at risk. Hazard mitigation assistance on wildfires on State and private lands, encouraging wildfire mitigation, such as reducing hazardous fuels, and reseeding ground cover will help reduce the costs of future disasters. Further, there are other provisions in this legislation that deal with the potential for catastrophic earthquake and tsunami. The Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of Oregon, northern California has generated at least 12 major, great earthquakes, magnitude 8 to 9, yet we are woefully unprepared in terms of any sorts of early detection. We have just begun the rudiments with some Federal assistance of a land-based early detection system. We need an ocean-based early detection system, such as the Japanese have deployed. Early warning of quakes and tsunamis will save many lives on the coast of Oregon, Washington, and northern California. It will also save tremendous amounts in terms of infrastructure in the inland and more distant areas where they would have ample warning to shut down transit systems, get people off bridges, stop elevators in high-rise buildings, and otherwise accommodate the public, preventing more loss of life and also more catastrophic problems. Again, Japan is far, far ahead of us. They can and have stopped their high-speed rail trains when they have distant warning of a coming tremor. Even though the tremors move quickly through the Earth, there is enough time to slow or stop those trains. They have had time to evacuate the coastal areas. Although, unfortunately, in the last quake, when they reestimated the size of the tsunami, they found out communications were down. Now they have taken care of this. Now they have moved to a cellular-based network to notify people the tsunami is coming and to get them to high ground. So we can and should do a lot more there. This bill opens the door to those sorts of programs here in the United States of America. Finally, it gives assurances--well, two more points--to State and local governments they will be reimbursed up to a certain amount for costs incurred during disaster recovery. {time} 1730 This will encourage local governments to undertake new mitigation projects, which is a good deal for both the Federal Government and for taxpayers. Mitigation saves $3 to $4 for every dollar invested. Finally, we have a power play by a minor Federal agency attempting to make FEMA become the national land use planning agency of the United States, trying to force FEMA to deny flood insurance to States that don't follow the directives of the National Marine Fisheries Service. This is not authorized by law. They are way out of line, unfortunately. I talked to the woman who is head of that agency. She disagrees. Her regional representative is hell-bent to become the land use planning agency for Oregon, although, of course, it already has comprehensive land use planning, unlike his home State of Washington, which was not subjected to these dramatic changes in law. We are making it clear that that is not the authority of FEMA in this bill. That is a reasonable position. It is a bipartisan position. I thank my colleague and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their help. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), who was very helpful in adding very important language that strengthened this bill. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, in August of 2013, the southern portion of my district experienced a major disaster involving heavy flooding, which devastated infrastructure and caused significant hardship to many of my constituents. Unfortunately, the Federal recovery efforts to this devastated region added insult to injury. Local officials dealt with multiple teams conducting duplicative site visits due to lost paperwork, inconsistent messages between various survey and evaluation teams, and unnecessarily long delays in recovery and reimbursement. Such a response to any disaster is unacceptable, and change is necessary. Last year I introduced a bill to address the shortcomings of the FEMA response to the 2013 flooding in my district to ensure future disaster recoveries in Missouri and elsewhere are as painless and efficient as possible. My bill, which is included in this reform package, requires FEMA to create an action plan to address inconsistent guidance, inappropriate recordkeeping procedures, and overall mixed assistance to local officials. Additionally, it directs FEMA to issue a forward-looking report to identify new technologies that further aid the disaster workforce in partnering with private nonprofits as well as State and local governments in the wake of a disaster or emergency. FEMA processes need to be streamlined and consistent in order to help those recovering from a disaster feel supported and assured the relief will come in a timely, efficient manner. I rise today in full support of H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act. Making sure Federal agencies have the proper oversight and resources they need is an important function of the U.S. Congress. This 3-year reauthorization is a shining example of a bipartisan, commonsense effort to make the people get the help and assistance they so desperately need in times of crisis. I want to thank the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Barletta, and the ranking member for including my language in the FEMA reform package. I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1471. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), [[Page H1023]] my good friend and a member of the committee. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for their fine work. The bill contains a bipartisan provision which I had the honor of working on with my friend and colleague from Florida, Congressman Dan Webster. As Floridians, we know hurricanes. In 2004 and 2005, Charley, Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, and Katrina tore through our State, leaving families stranded and property damaged. Trees crashed to the ground, ripping power lines and blocking flooded streets. Water systems were compromised. Our local governments did a miraculous job cleaning debris from public ways, fixing broken infrastructure, and getting life back to normal. It takes a lot to get this done. When hurricanes strike, communities are ravaged and so are their budgets. So I want to thank FEMA for the funding assistance it provided Florida at a time of great stress and need. Now FEMA is asking some of our cities and counties to pay back money that they were given for disaster relief projects that were approved more than 10 years ago. But here is the thing. There is no question that FEMA should do responsible audits of its relief payments to make sure that money was used properly. But unless there is fraud, the process should not be an endless journey into the Federal bureaucracy. Our local governments, unlike the Federal Government, have to balance their budgets. They can't afford to wait 5, 10, or an infinite number of years for FEMA to do its assessment, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Simply said, the current practice unfairly stymies our local governments' ability to plan their future budgets. This legislation will make sure that the process is more balanced, giving FEMA adequate time to review its grant payments while allowing for financial security to local governments. I urge my colleagues to support this very good legislation. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who spent a lot of time and worked very hard to make this bill better. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the reality, as the gentleman from Indiana noted earlier, is that we are going to have disasters and we are going to spend funds responding to those disasters. The problem with the United States disaster management policy is that it is backward. It is entirely reactive. Rather than going in before a disaster happens and making areas more resilient, making our ecosytem more resilient, making our economy more resilient, we are dead set on this process of coming in after disasters and spending exponentially more dollars. The ranking member referenced a few figures a little while ago. He referenced a figure of a CBO study indicating that, for every $1 we invest in the right type of hazard mitigation, we save $3 in disaster response cost. There was another study that FEMA did. For every $1 we invest, we have $4 in cost savings. I think, Mr. Speaker, with the right criteria, you actually even save more. Now, we are challenged as a Nation right now because the agency that is primarily responsible for making our communities more resilient is the U.S. Army Corps Engineers, which, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, is stuck on stupid. What we have seen over the last several years is, rather than trying to fix that, we have seen other agencies coming up being granting agencies. We have seen FEMA. This year we have seen the Department of the Interior in the President's budget. In the recent years, we have seen HUD. Rather than fixing the problem, we are just trying to go around it and put more granting agencies out there. It is creating a disparate approach, an approach that is not coordinated and an approach that is going to result in more taxpayers' funds being spent on the wrong projects, the wrong priorities, rather than being proactive. This bill addresses that, Mr. Speaker. This bill actually incudes a provision that has FEMA begin developing a coordinated, proactive approach to how we mitigate or reduce vulnerabilities from disasters. In the last several years, in my home State of Louisiana, we have seen extraordinary disasters, whether it is Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 or Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. We had the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2011. In 2012, we had Hurricane Isaac. In 2011 and again this year, we saw record-high water on the Mississippi River system causing flooding. We are going to spend dollars. We have got to spend them in the right and principled places. This bill does a number of things that are important. Number one, it eliminates bureaucracy and helps to streamline the process of getting dollars on the ground to some of our important impacted areas. We have seen where this bill comes in and it actually changes criteria, where severely impacted local communities, like in Louisiana, where we just saw St. John Parish, Ascension Parish, Livingston Parish, the area of Kenner, and St. James Parish experience extraordinary impacts from tornadoes. Those areas actually could potentially qualify for Federal disaster because of the severe impacts in some of these limited areas. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for working with us on a provision that prevents FEMA from being able to move the goalpost on us, being able to come and change conditions after a grant is made that could result in homeowners having to pay back absurd amounts of money when they followed the criteria and followed the commitments when they entered into these grant agreements. Mr. Speaker, this bill goes a long way. I want to continue working with the leaders of this bill on these zones, on duplication of efforts, and other things. But I will say it again, Mr. Speaker: we are going to spend the money one way or another. We need to spend it in a principled manner. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues for passing H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015. This important legislation authorizes appropriations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency for FY2016-FY2018 for management and administration. It also, directs FEMA, through the National Advisory Council, to undertake and report on a comprehensive study of disaster costs and losses. H.R. 1471 includes provisions that I introduced that extends the authority of FEMA's Administrator to waive debts associated with an overpayment of individual assistance, so long as the overpayment was not a result of fraud. This issue received national attention when about 30 residents at the Belle Harbor Manor, an assisted living facility in my district, received collection notices related to assistance provided by FEMA in the aftermath of Super Storm Sandy. FEMA's Administrator, Craig Fugate, later cancelled their debts. However, he is limited in canceling the debts of others who are in the exact same situation. H.R. 1471 fixes this and provides FEMA's Administrator with expanded authority to waive debts of thousands of Super Storm Sandy survivors, as well as the debts incurred as a result of future natural disasters. I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Lou Barletta and Representative Peter DeFazio, for their assistance in developing this language. I would also like to thank New York State Assemblyman Phillip Goldfeder for his tireless advocacy on behalf of Super Storm Sandy victims. It is my hope that this measure will receive speedy passage in the Senate so it can be signed by President Obama, and survivors of Super Storm Sandy can finally recover for this horrific act of God. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1471, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1015-H1023] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEMA DISASTER ASSISTANCE REFORM ACT OF 2015 Mr. BARLETTA.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1471, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shuster for his tremendous support and leadership on this bill. Few Members of Congress have had a greater impact on reforming our disaster programs since Hurricane Katrina than Chairman Shuster. This bill represents another important step in that effort, and I greatly appreciate the chairman's help. I also want to thank Ranking Member DeFazio and Ranking Member Carson for their bipartisan support of the bill. The FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act has two primary goals: to help save lives and to save taxpayer money. {time} 1715 The bill helps save lives by fixing a longstanding problem that hinders the deployment of critical search and rescue teams between States. These reforms will help ensure our constituents receive the help they need when disaster strikes. Additionally, this bill helps save money by improving the cost- effectiveness of FEMA's existing disaster assistance programs. For example, there are provisions that will speed up reconstruction and lower administrative costs. The bill also saves money by encouraging smart recovery practices and mitigation to lower the costs of the next disaster. The bill commissions a comprehensive review of the growing disaster losses the Nation has experienced over the past decades. Experts estimated over $1 trillion of disaster losses have occurred in North America since 1980. FEMA alone has spent almost $200 billion on over 1300 major Presidential disaster declarations since 1989. These numbers are going up, and we should try to find ways to bring those costs down over time. It has been over 20 years since we have had a comprehensive look at disaster spending. It is time for a big picture assessment of what is driving these costs and to review if we, as a Nation, are responding in the most appropriate and cost-effective way. Right after I became a Member of Congress, my district was hit hard by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. I saw homes destroyed, lives and livelihoods upset. Disaster relief is critical at times like these, and people need help to rebuild their lives and rebuild their communities. As I witnessed the recovery, I was amazed that folks were rebuilding back in the very same place, in the very same way, leaving themselves just as vulnerable to the next storm. We have to be compassionate and responsive to our citizens, but we also have a duty to be a good steward of the taxpayer dollars. I am committed to establishing this study to see if we can tackle these tough issues and find solutions that are driven by facts and data rather than the emotion that inevitably follows a disaster. These reforms are one of my top priorities this Congress. At the end of the day, the purpose of this bill is to ensure help will be there when disaster strikes and our constituents need that help the most. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Act of 2015. I appreciate your willingness to support expediting the consideration of this legislation on the House Floor. I acknowledge that by waiving consideration of this bill, the Committee on the Judiciary does not waive any future valid jurisdictional claim to provisions in this or similar legislation.

I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation, and I look forward to working with the Committee on the Judiciary as the bill moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bipartisan measure before us today. H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015, as amended, contains several provisions important to State and local governments and emergency managers. I will only highlight a few of them. I also want to acknowledge Chairman Barletta and my good friend, Ranking Member DeFazio. Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, the most important aspect of this bill is that it clarifies compensation and liability issues for urban search and rescue team members. These members provide critical services and put themselves in harm's way to help others involved in a disaster. In Indianapolis, my city, our own urban search and rescue team, which consists of firefighters, paramedics, civilians, and others responded to Hurricane Sandy. They did so despite the uncertainties that they would be covered for any injuries. These protections, Mr. Speaker, are long overdue. Team members can now rest assured that they will be taken care of when activated for Federal service if they are injured. Another important provision grows out of the individual States' and local governments' need to know that they can rely on FEMA's decisions and reimbursement amounts. Local governments make major decisions during the disaster recovery phase in reliance on FEMA's initial approval. There comes a time, Mr. Speaker, when FEMA should not be able to reverse its initial decisions or award amounts. Statute of limitations protections for individuals, States, and local governments will provide peace of mind and certainty needed to go forward with the recovery process. Climate change, Mr. Speaker, is causing more extreme weather patterns. So in order for us to become more resilient, we must encourage more local governments, communities to undertake mitigation measures. Some communities may forgo mitigation actions because they do not have the capacity to administer the funds. Ensuring that local governments will be reimbursed for management costs should help us all obtain more resilient communities. Finally, Mr. Speaker, our subcommittee has embarked on discussions related to the trends and causes of rising disaster costs and losses. In furtherance of this discussion, the bill requires FEMA's National Advisory Council to study the issue and make recommendations to Congress and address causes and trends. Specifically, the bill requires the Council to examine mechanisms and incentives to promote mitigation and to make recommendations regarding the same. The last few years, Mr. Speaker, I have introduced a bill to reauthorize the disaster mitigation program. Mr. Speaker, mitigation saves taxpayer funds over the long haul. I look forward to any recommendations from the National Advisory Council on how we can strengthen this available and very effective program. I want to thank Chairman Barletta again and Ranking Member DeFazio for their leadership on this very important measure. As an original cosponsor of this measure, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting H.R. 1471. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who knows very well how important these disaster programs are when disasters have struck his State of Illinois. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. FEMA's disaster declaration process is broken. You don't need to look any further than the State of Illinois to see how FEMA's aid formula is failing the hardworking families of this country because it simply doesn't put all communities on a level playing field. In 2012, Harrisburg, Illinois, was denied Federal assistance following tornadoes that swept across the Midwest, while Missouri and Kentucky received it. Recently, towns like Gifford and Washington in central Illinois were denied public assistance as well. FEMA currently takes into account several factors when determining the need for public and individual assistance. However, there currently is no standard to determine which factor is more important than another, which leads to highly subjective and uncertain processes that leave States and communities in limbo for weeks as their application is considered. By working with this committee and this subcommittee that Chairman Barletta chairs, we were able to include language that was based on a bill that I introduced with many of my colleagues that requires the administrator of FEMA, when making recommendations to the President regarding a major disaster declaration, to give greater weight and consideration to localized impact. Consideration of this important legislation is timely for my home State of Illinois. Just days ago, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner submitted a request to President Obama asking him to declare a major disaster for Illinois following the extensive holiday flooding that we saw right at about the new year. Much of this damage happened in my home county of Christian County, where four people tragically lost their lives after encountering flood waters. Sadly, two of the deceased, Brandon Mann and Devan Everett, were from my hometown of Taylorville. Certainly no amount of resources can compensate for the loss of human life when disaster strikes, and yet these communities still need to rebuild. Preliminary damage assessments determined that communities in Illinois experienced $15 million in damages. Unfortunately, that doesn't meet FEMA's $18.1 million threshold. Mr. Speaker, it is just not right that States like Illinois, where a significant portion of the population is concentrated in a single area, can be denied disaster relief because of an arbitrary formula developed by bureaucrats in concrete buildings right here in Washington, D.C. That is what makes this bill and my provision so important. It levels the playing field. It tells rural America that, when disaster [[Page H1022]] strikes, we are going to look out for you, too. Mr. Speaker, I come from rural America. I know these people. These are not the type of people who expect help, who expect Washington to solve their problems; but we as Members of Congress and as Americans have an obligation to commit that we will be there for them when they need us and that we won't let arbitrary formulas prevent that help from being delivered. We need this bill. We need these reforms. It will make a difference. Thank you again to Chairman Barletta, Chairman Shuster, and the ranking members. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), my good friend and ranking member. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member of the subcommittee, for yielding, and I thank him for his excellent work on this bill, as I do the subcommittee chair and the full committee chairman. This is a bill very much in the tradition of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure where, in fact, we have come together and put together a bipartisan proposal to reauthorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a critical, critical agency, as you have heard from some of the previous speakers. In particular, in the West, we have some issues regarding wildfires. We had the worst wildfire season on record last year: 10 million acres burned; half the Forest Service budget went to fighting these wildfires. The perversity of that is that, when astounding amounts of money like that are required from the Forest Service, the Forest Service has to reduce other budgets, including preventative activities, particularly fuel reduction and other activities that would prevent future fires. So we are on this endless cycle that should end. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't end that. I hope that happens later in the Congress. There is legislation pending in both the House and the Senate that we have come close to moving that would deal with declaring that catastrophic fires are disasters, just like tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, et cetera. In this bill, we did make some progress. It makes State and private lands eligible for hazard mitigation assistance after wildfires. It is a commonsense solution to save on future disaster costs and losses. The bill also encourages States to direct the funds to the areas that experienced the wildfire. I thank our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz), for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. You have a fire, and particularly in California and elsewhere you have potential for catastrophic mudslides, future catastrophes, putting the public at risk. Hazard mitigation assistance on wildfires on State and private lands, encouraging wildfire mitigation, such as reducing hazardous fuels, and reseeding ground cover will help reduce the costs of future disasters. Further, there are other provisions in this legislation that deal with the potential for catastrophic earthquake and tsunami. The Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of Oregon, northern California has generated at least 12 major, great earthquakes, magnitude 8 to 9, yet we are woefully unprepared in terms of any sorts of early detection. We have just begun the rudiments with some Federal assistance of a land-based early detection system. We need an ocean-based early detection system, such as the Japanese have deployed. Early warning of quakes and tsunamis will save many lives on the coast of Oregon, Washington, and northern California. It will also save tremendous amounts in terms of infrastructure in the inland and more distant areas where they would have ample warning to shut down transit systems, get people off bridges, stop elevators in high-rise buildings, and otherwise accommodate the public, preventing more loss of life and also more catastrophic problems. Again, Japan is far, far ahead of us. They can and have stopped their high-speed rail trains when they have distant warning of a coming tremor. Even though the tremors move quickly through the Earth, there is enough time to slow or stop those trains. They have had time to evacuate the coastal areas. Although, unfortunately, in the last quake, when they reestimated the size of the tsunami, they found out communications were down. Now they have taken care of this. Now they have moved to a cellular-based network to notify people the tsunami is coming and to get them to high ground. So we can and should do a lot more there. This bill opens the door to those sorts of programs here in the United States of America. Finally, it gives assurances--well, two more points--to State and local governments they will be reimbursed up to a certain amount for costs incurred during disaster recovery. {time} 1730 This will encourage local governments to undertake new mitigation projects, which is a good deal for both the Federal Government and for taxpayers. Mitigation saves $3 to $4 for every dollar invested. Finally, we have a power play by a minor Federal agency attempting to make FEMA become the national land use planning agency of the United States, trying to force FEMA to deny flood insurance to States that don't follow the directives of the National Marine Fisheries Service. This is not authorized by law. They are way out of line, unfortunately. I talked to the woman who is head of that agency. She disagrees. Her regional representative is hell-bent to become the land use planning agency for Oregon, although, of course, it already has comprehensive land use planning, unlike his home State of Washington, which was not subjected to these dramatic changes in law. We are making it clear that that is not the authority of FEMA in this bill. That is a reasonable position. It is a bipartisan position. I thank my colleague and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their help. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), who was very helpful in adding very important language that strengthened this bill. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, in August of 2013, the southern portion of my district experienced a major disaster involving heavy flooding, which devastated infrastructure and caused significant hardship to many of my constituents. Unfortunately, the Federal recovery efforts to this devastated region added insult to injury. Local officials dealt with multiple teams conducting duplicative site visits due to lost paperwork, inconsistent messages between various survey and evaluation teams, and unnecessarily long delays in recovery and reimbursement. Such a response to any disaster is unacceptable, and change is necessary. Last year I introduced a bill to address the shortcomings of the FEMA response to the 2013 flooding in my district to ensure future disaster recoveries in Missouri and elsewhere are as painless and efficient as possible. My bill, which is included in this reform package, requires FEMA to create an action plan to address inconsistent guidance, inappropriate recordkeeping procedures, and overall mixed assistance to local officials. Additionally, it directs FEMA to issue a forward-looking report to identify new technologies that further aid the disaster workforce in partnering with private nonprofits as well as State and local governments in the wake of a disaster or emergency. FEMA processes need to be streamlined and consistent in order to help those recovering from a disaster feel supported and assured the relief will come in a timely, efficient manner. I rise today in full support of H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act. Making sure Federal agencies have the proper oversight and resources they need is an important function of the U.S. Congress. This 3-year reauthorization is a shining example of a bipartisan, commonsense effort to make the people get the help and assistance they so desperately need in times of crisis. I want to thank the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Barletta, and the ranking member for including my language in the FEMA reform package. I encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1471. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), [[Page H1023]] my good friend and a member of the committee. Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for their fine work. The bill contains a bipartisan provision which I had the honor of working on with my friend and colleague from Florida, Congressman Dan Webster. As Floridians, we know hurricanes. In 2004 and 2005, Charley, Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, and Katrina tore through our State, leaving families stranded and property damaged. Trees crashed to the ground, ripping power lines and blocking flooded streets. Water systems were compromised. Our local governments did a miraculous job cleaning debris from public ways, fixing broken infrastructure, and getting life back to normal. It takes a lot to get this done. When hurricanes strike, communities are ravaged and so are their budgets. So I want to thank FEMA for the funding assistance it provided Florida at a time of great stress and need. Now FEMA is asking some of our cities and counties to pay back money that they were given for disaster relief projects that were approved more than 10 years ago. But here is the thing. There is no question that FEMA should do responsible audits of its relief payments to make sure that money was used properly. But unless there is fraud, the process should not be an endless journey into the Federal bureaucracy. Our local governments, unlike the Federal Government, have to balance their budgets. They can't afford to wait 5, 10, or an infinite number of years for FEMA to do its assessment, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Simply said, the current practice unfairly stymies our local governments' ability to plan their future budgets. This legislation will make sure that the process is more balanced, giving FEMA adequate time to review its grant payments while allowing for financial security to local governments. I urge my colleagues to support this very good legislation. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who spent a lot of time and worked very hard to make this bill better. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the reality, as the gentleman from Indiana noted earlier, is that we are going to have disasters and we are going to spend funds responding to those disasters. The problem with the United States disaster management policy is that it is backward. It is entirely reactive. Rather than going in before a disaster happens and making areas more resilient, making our ecosytem more resilient, making our economy more resilient, we are dead set on this process of coming in after disasters and spending exponentially more dollars. The ranking member referenced a few figures a little while ago. He referenced a figure of a CBO study indicating that, for every $1 we invest in the right type of hazard mitigation, we save $3 in disaster response cost. There was another study that FEMA did. For every $1 we invest, we have $4 in cost savings. I think, Mr. Speaker, with the right criteria, you actually even save more. Now, we are challenged as a Nation right now because the agency that is primarily responsible for making our communities more resilient is the U.S. Army Corps Engineers, which, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, is stuck on stupid. What we have seen over the last several years is, rather than trying to fix that, we have seen other agencies coming up being granting agencies. We have seen FEMA. This year we have seen the Department of the Interior in the President's budget. In the recent years, we have seen HUD. Rather than fixing the problem, we are just trying to go around it and put more granting agencies out there. It is creating a disparate approach, an approach that is not coordinated and an approach that is going to result in more taxpayers' funds being spent on the wrong projects, the wrong priorities, rather than being proactive. This bill addresses that, Mr. Speaker. This bill actually incudes a provision that has FEMA begin developing a coordinated, proactive approach to how we mitigate or reduce vulnerabilities from disasters. In the last several years, in my home State of Louisiana, we have seen extraordinary disasters, whether it is Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 or Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. We had the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2011. In 2012, we had Hurricane Isaac. In 2011 and again this year, we saw record-high water on the Mississippi River system causing flooding. We are going to spend dollars. We have got to spend them in the right and principled places. This bill does a number of things that are important. Number one, it eliminates bureaucracy and helps to streamline the process of getting dollars on the ground to some of our important impacted areas. We have seen where this bill comes in and it actually changes criteria, where severely impacted local communities, like in Louisiana, where we just saw St. John Parish, Ascension Parish, Livingston Parish, the area of Kenner, and St. James Parish experience extraordinary impacts from tornadoes. Those areas actually could potentially qualify for Federal disaster because of the severe impacts in some of these limited areas. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for working with us on a provision that prevents FEMA from being able to move the goalpost on us, being able to come and change conditions after a grant is made that could result in homeowners having to pay back absurd amounts of money when they followed the criteria and followed the commitments when they entered into these grant agreements. Mr. Speaker, this bill goes a long way. I want to continue working with the leaders of this bill on these zones, on duplication of efforts, and other things. But I will say it again, Mr. Speaker: we are going to spend the money one way or another. We need to spend it in a principled manner. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues for passing H.R. 1471, the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015. This important legislation authorizes appropriations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency for FY2016-FY2018 for management and administration. It also, directs FEMA, through the National Advisory Council, to undertake and report on a comprehensive study of disaster costs and losses. H.R. 1471 includes provisions that I introduced that extends the authority of FEMA's Administrator to waive debts associated with an overpayment of individual assistance, so long as the overpayment was not a result of fraud. This issue received national attention when about 30 residents at the Belle Harbor Manor, an assisted living facility in my district, received collection notices related to assistance provided by FEMA in the aftermath of Super Storm Sandy. FEMA's Administrator, Craig Fugate, later cancelled their debts. However, he is limited in canceling the debts of others who are in the exact same situation. H.R. 1471 fixes this and provides FEMA's Administrator with expanded authority to waive debts of thousands of Super Storm Sandy survivors, as well as the debts incurred as a result of future natural disasters. I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Lou Barletta and Representative Peter DeFazio, for their assistance in developing this language. I would also like to thank New York State Assemblyman Phillip Goldfeder for his tireless advocacy on behalf of Super Storm Sandy victims. It is my hope that this measure will receive speedy passage in the Senate so it can be signed by President Obama, and survivors of Super Storm Sandy can finally recover for this horrific act of God. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1471, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,74512,74512,74582,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [house] [pages h1015-h1023] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] fema disaster assistance reform act of 2015 mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 1471) to reauthorize the programs and activities of the federal emergency management agency, as amended.

that will speed up reconstruction and lower administrative costs. the bill also saves money by encouraging smart recovery practices and mitigation to lower the costs of the next disaster. the bill commissions a comprehensive review of the growing disaster losses the nation has experienced over the past decades. experts estimated over $1 trillion of disaster losses have occurred in north america since 1980. fema alone has spent almost $200 billion on over 1300 major presidential disaster declarations since 1989. these numbers are going up, and we should try to find ways to bring those costs down over time. it has been over 20 years since we have had a comprehensive look at disaster spending. it is time for a big picture assessment of what is driving these costs and to review if we, as a nation, are responding in the most appropriate and cost-effective way. right after i became a member of congress, my district was hit hard by hurricane irene and tropical storm lee. i saw homes destroyed, lives and livelihoods upset. disaster relief is critical at times like these, and people need help to rebuild their lives and rebuild their communities. as i witnessed the recovery, i was amazed that folks were rebuilding back in the very same place, in the very same way, leaving themselves just as vulnerable to the next storm. we have to be compassionate and responsive to our citizens, but we also have a duty to be a good steward of the taxpayer dollars. i am committed to establishing this study to see if we can tackle these tough issues and find solutions that are driven by facts and data rather than the emotion that inevitably follows a disaster. these reforms are one of my top priorities this congress. at the end of the day, the purpose of this bill is to ensure help will be there when disaster strikes and our constituents need that help the most. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on homeland security,

and i look forward to working with the committee on the judiciary as the bill moves through the legislative process. sincerely, bill shuster, chairman. mr. carson of indiana. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the bipartisan measure before us today. h.r. 1471, the fema disaster assistance reform act of 2015, as amended, contains several provisions important to state and local governments and emergency managers. i will only highlight a few of them. i also want to acknowledge chairman barletta and my good friend, ranking member defazio. mr. speaker, in my opinion, the most important aspect of this bill is that it clarifies compensation and liability issues for urban search and rescue team members. these members provide critical services and put themselves in harm's way to help others involved in a disaster. in indianapolis, my city, our own urban search and rescue team, which consists of firefighters, paramedics, civilians, and others responded to hurricane sandy. they did so despite the uncertainties that they would be covered for any injuries. these protections, mr. speaker, are long overdue. team members can now rest assured that they will be taken care of when activated for federal service if they are injured. another important provision grows out of the individual states' and local governments' need to know that they can rely on fema's decisions and reimbursement amounts. local governments make major decisions during the disaster recovery phase in reliance on fema's initial approval. there comes a time, mr. speaker, when fema should not be able to reverse its initial decisions or award amounts. statute of limitations protections for individuals, states, and local governments will provide peace of mind and certainty needed to go forward with the recovery process. climate change, mr. speaker, is causing more extreme weather patterns. so in order for us to become more resilient, we must encourage more local governments, communities to undertake mitigation measures. some communities may forgo mitigation actions because they do not have the capacity to administer the funds. ensuring that local governments will be reimbursed for management costs should help us all obtain more resilient communities. finally, mr. speaker, our subcommittee has embarked on discussions related to the trends and causes of rising disaster costs and losses. in furtherance of this discussion, the bill requires fema's national advisory council to study the issue and make recommendations to congress and address causes and trends. specifically, the bill requires the council to examine mechanisms and incentives to promote mitigation and to make recommendations regarding the same. the last few years, mr. speaker, i have introduced a bill to reauthorize the disaster mitigation program. mr. speaker, mitigation saves taxpayer funds over the long haul. i look forward to any recommendations from the national advisory council on how we can strengthen this available and very effective program. i want to thank chairman barletta again and ranking member defazio for their leadership on this very important measure. as an original cosponsor of this measure, mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to join us in supporting h.r. 1471. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. rodney davis), who knows very well how important these disaster programs are when disasters have struck his state of illinois. mr. rodney davis of illinois. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of this bill. fema's disaster declaration process is broken. you don't need to look any further than the state of illinois to see how fema's aid formula is failing the hardworking families of this country because it simply doesn't put all communities on a level playing field. in 2012, harrisburg, illinois, was denied federal assistance following tornadoes that swept across the midwest, while missouri and kentucky received it. recently, towns like gifford and washington in central illinois were denied public assistance as well. fema currently takes into account several factors when determining the need for public and individual assistance. however, there currently is no standard to determine which factor is more important than another, which leads to highly subjective and uncertain processes that leave states and communities in limbo for weeks as their application is considered. by working with this committee and this subcommittee that chairman barletta chairs, we were able to include language that was based on a bill that i introduced with many of my colleagues that requires the administrator of fema, when making recommendations to the president regarding a major disaster declaration, to give greater weight and consideration to localized impact. consideration of this important legislation is timely for my home state of illinois. just days ago, illinois governor bruce rauner submitted a request to president obama asking him to declare a major disaster for illinois following the extensive holiday flooding that we saw right at about the new year. much of this damage happened in my home county of christian county, where four people tragically lost their lives after encountering flood waters. sadly, two of the deceased, brandon mann and devan everett, were from my hometown of taylorville. certainly no amount of resources can compensate for the loss of human life when disaster strikes, and yet these communities still need to rebuild. preliminary damage assessments determined that communities in illinois experienced $15 million in damages. unfortunately, that doesn't meet fema's $18.1 million threshold. mr. speaker, it is just not right that states like illinois, where a significant portion of the population is concentrated in a single area, can be denied disaster relief because of an arbitrary formula developed by bureaucrats in concrete buildings right here in washington, d.c. that is what makes this bill and my provision so important. it levels the playing field. it tells rural america that, when disaster [[page h1022]] strikes, we are going to look out for you, too. mr. speaker, i come from rural america. i know these people. these are not the type of people who expect help, who expect washington to solve their problems; but we as members of congress and as americans have an obligation to commit that we will be there for them when they need us and that we won't let arbitrary formulas prevent that help from being delivered. we need this bill. we need these reforms. it will make a difference. thank you again to chairman barletta, chairman shuster, and the ranking members. mr. carson of indiana. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from oregon (mr. defazio), my good friend and ranking member. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman, the ranking member of the subcommittee, for yielding, and i thank him for his excellent work on this bill, as i do the subcommittee chair and the full committee chairman. this is a bill very much in the tradition of the committee on transportation and infrastructure where, in fact, we have come together and put together a bipartisan proposal to reauthorize the federal emergency management agency, a critical, critical agency, as you have heard from some of the previous speakers. in particular, in the west, we have some issues regarding wildfires. we had the worst wildfire season on record last year: 10 million acres burned; half the forest service budget went to fighting these wildfires. the perversity of that is that, when astounding amounts of money like that are required from the forest service, the forest service has to reduce other budgets, including preventative activities, particularly fuel reduction and other activities that would prevent future fires. so we are on this endless cycle that should end. unfortunately, this bill doesn't end that. i hope that happens later in the congress. there is legislation pending in both the house and the senate that we have come close to moving that would deal with declaring that catastrophic fires are disasters, just like tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, et cetera. in this bill, we did make some progress. it makes state and private lands eligible for hazard mitigation assistance after wildfires. it is a commonsense solution to save on future disaster costs and losses. the bill also encourages states to direct the funds to the areas that experienced the wildfire. i thank our colleague, the gentleman from california (mr. ruiz), for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. you have a fire, and particularly in california and elsewhere you have potential for catastrophic mudslides, future catastrophes, putting the public at risk. hazard mitigation assistance on wildfires on state and private lands, encouraging wildfire mitigation, such as reducing hazardous fuels, and reseeding ground cover will help reduce the costs of future disasters. further, there are other provisions in this legislation that deal with the potential for catastrophic earthquake and tsunami. the cascadia subduction zone off the coast of oregon, northern california has generated at least 12 major, great earthquakes, magnitude 8 to 9, yet we are woefully unprepared in terms of any sorts of early detection. we have just begun the rudiments with some federal assistance of a land-based early detection system. we need an ocean-based early detection system, such as the japanese have deployed. early warning of quakes and tsunamis will save many lives on the coast of oregon, washington, and northern california. it will also save tremendous amounts in terms of infrastructure in the inland and more distant areas where they would have ample warning to shut down transit systems, get people off bridges, stop elevators in high-rise buildings, and otherwise accommodate the public, preventing more loss of life and also more catastrophic problems. again, japan is far, far ahead of us. they can and have stopped their high-speed rail trains when they have distant warning of a coming tremor. even though the tremors move quickly through the earth, there is enough time to slow or stop those trains. they have had time to evacuate the coastal areas. although, unfortunately, in the last quake, when they reestimated the size of the tsunami, they found out communications were down. now they have taken care of this. now they have moved to a cellular-based network to notify people the tsunami is coming and to get them to high ground. so we can and should do a lot more there. this bill opens the door to those sorts of programs here in the united states of america. finally, it gives assurances--well, two more points--to state and local governments they will be reimbursed up to a certain amount for costs incurred during disaster recovery. {time} 1730 this will encourage local governments to undertake new mitigation projects, which is a good deal for both the federal government and for taxpayers. mitigation saves $3 to $4 for every dollar invested. finally, we have a power play by a minor federal agency attempting to make fema become the national land use planning agency of the united states, trying to force fema to deny flood insurance to states that don't follow the directives of the national marine fisheries service. this is not authorized by law. they are way out of line, unfortunately. i talked to the woman who is head of that agency. she disagrees. her regional representative is hell-bent to become the land use planning agency for oregon, although, of course, it already has comprehensive land use planning, unlike his home state of washington, which was not subjected to these dramatic changes in law. we are making it clear that that is not the authority of fema in this bill. that is a reasonable position. it is a bipartisan position. i thank my colleague and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their help. mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from missouri (mrs. hartzler), who was very helpful in adding very important language that strengthened this bill. mrs. hartzler. mr. speaker, in august of 2013, the southern portion of my district experienced a major disaster involving heavy flooding, which devastated infrastructure and caused significant hardship to many of my constituents. unfortunately, the federal recovery efforts to this devastated region added insult to injury. local officials dealt with multiple teams conducting duplicative site visits due to lost paperwork, inconsistent messages between various survey and evaluation teams, and unnecessarily long delays in recovery and reimbursement. such a response to any disaster is unacceptable, and change is necessary. last year i introduced a bill to address the shortcomings of the fema response to the 2013 flooding in my district to ensure future disaster recoveries in missouri and elsewhere are as painless and efficient as possible. my bill, which is included in this reform package, requires fema to create an action plan to address inconsistent guidance, inappropriate recordkeeping procedures, and overall mixed assistance to local officials. additionally, it directs fema to issue a forward-looking report to identify new technologies that further aid the disaster workforce in partnering with private nonprofits as well as state and local governments in the wake of a disaster or emergency. fema processes need to be streamlined and consistent in order to help those recovering from a disaster feel supported and assured the relief will come in a timely, efficient manner. i rise today in full support of h.r. 1471, the fema disaster assistance reform act. making sure federal agencies have the proper oversight and resources they need is an important function of the u.s. congress. this 3-year reauthorization is a shining example of a bipartisan, commonsense effort to make the people get the help and assistance they so desperately need in times of crisis. i want to thank the sponsor of this bill, mr. barletta, and the ranking member for including my language in the fema reform package. i encourage my colleagues to vote for h.r. 1471. mr. carson of indiana. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. frankel), [[page h1023]] my good friend and a member of the committee. ms. frankel of florida. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 1471, the fema disaster assistance reform act, and i thank the chairman and ranking member for their fine work. the bill contains a bipartisan provision which i had the honor of working on with my friend and colleague from florida, congressman dan webster. as floridians, we know hurricanes. in 2004 and 2005, charley, frances, jeanne, wilma, and katrina tore through our state, leaving families stranded and property damaged. trees crashed to the ground, ripping power lines and blocking flooded streets. water systems were compromised. our local governments did a miraculous job cleaning debris from public ways, fixing broken infrastructure, and getting life back to normal. it takes a lot to get this done. when hurricanes strike, communities are ravaged and so are their budgets. so i want to thank fema for the funding assistance it provided florida at a time of great stress and need. now fema is asking some of our cities and counties to pay back money that they were given for disaster relief projects that were approved more than 10 years ago. but here is the thing. there is no question that fema should do responsible audits of its relief payments to make sure that money was used properly. but unless there is fraud, the process should not be an endless journey into the federal bureaucracy. our local governments, unlike the federal government, have to balance their budgets. they can't afford to wait 5, 10, or an infinite number of years for fema to do its assessment, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. simply said, the current practice unfairly stymies our local governments' ability to plan their future budgets. this legislation will make sure that the process is more balanced, giving fema adequate time to review its grant payments while allowing for financial security to local governments. i urge my colleagues to support this very good legislation. mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. graves), who spent a lot of time and worked very hard to make this bill better. mr. graves of louisiana. mr. speaker, i want to thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, the reality, as the gentleman from indiana noted earlier, is that we are going to have disasters and we are going to spend funds responding to those disasters. the problem with the united states disaster management policy is that it is backward. it is entirely reactive. rather than going in before a disaster happens and making areas more resilient, making our ecosytem more resilient, making our economy more resilient, we are dead set on this process of coming in after disasters and spending exponentially more dollars. the ranking member referenced a few figures a little while ago. he referenced a figure of a cbo study indicating that, for every $1 we invest in the right type of hazard mitigation, we save $3 in disaster response cost. there was another study that fema did. for every $1 we invest, we have $4 in cost savings. i think, mr. speaker, with the right criteria, you actually even save more. now, we are challenged as a nation right now because the agency that is primarily responsible for making our communities more resilient is the u.s. army corps engineers, which, unfortunately, mr. speaker, is stuck on stupid. what we have seen over the last several years is, rather than trying to fix that, we have seen other agencies coming up being granting agencies. we have seen fema. this year we have seen the department of the interior in the president's budget. in the recent years, we have seen hud. rather than fixing the problem, we are just trying to go around it and put more granting agencies out there. it is creating a disparate approach, an approach that is not coordinated and an approach that is going to result in more taxpayers' funds being spent on the wrong projects, the wrong priorities, rather than being proactive. this bill addresses that, mr. speaker. this bill actually incudes a provision that has fema begin developing a coordinated, proactive approach to how we mitigate or reduce vulnerabilities from disasters. in the last several years, in my home state of louisiana, we have seen extraordinary disasters, whether it is hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 or hurricanes gustav and ike in 2008. we had the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2011. in 2012, we had hurricane isaac. in 2011 and again this year, we saw record-high water on the mississippi river system causing flooding. we are going to spend dollars. we have got to spend them in the right and principled places. this bill does a number of things that are important. number one, it eliminates bureaucracy and helps to streamline the process of getting dollars on the ground to some of our important impacted areas. we have seen where this bill comes in and it actually changes criteria, where severely impacted local communities, like in louisiana, where we just saw st. john parish, ascension parish, livingston parish, the area of kenner, and st. james parish experience extraordinary impacts from tornadoes. those areas actually could potentially qualify for federal disaster because of the severe impacts in some of these limited areas. most importantly, mr. speaker, i want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for working with us on a provision that prevents fema from being able to move the goalpost on us, being able to come and change conditions after a grant is made that could result in homeowners having to pay back absurd amounts of money when they followed the criteria and followed the commitments when they entered into these grant agreements. mr. speaker, this bill goes a long way. i want to continue working with the leaders of this bill on these zones, on duplication of efforts, and other things. but i will say it again, mr. speaker: we are going to spend the money one way or another. we need to spend it in a principled manner. mr. carson of indiana. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. meeks. mr. speaker, i rise today to commend my colleagues for passing h.r. 1471, the fema disaster assistance reform act of 2015. this important legislation authorizes appropriations for the federal emergency management agency for fy2016-fy2018 for management and administration. it also, directs fema, through the national advisory council, to undertake and report on a comprehensive study of disaster costs and losses. h.r. 1471 includes provisions that i introduced that extends the authority of fema's administrator to waive debts associated with an overpayment of individual assistance, so long as the overpayment was not a result of fraud. this issue received national attention when about 30 residents at the belle harbor manor, an assisted living facility in my district, received collection notices related to assistance provided by fema in the aftermath of super storm sandy. fema's administrator, craig fugate, later cancelled their debts. however, he is limited in canceling the debts of others who are in the exact same situation. h.r. 1471 fixes this and provides fema's administrator with expanded authority to waive debts of thousands of super storm sandy survivors, as well as the debts incurred as a result of future natural disasters. i want to thank my colleagues, representative lou barletta and representative peter defazio, for their assistance in developing this language. i would also like to thank new york state assemblyman phillip goldfeder for his tireless advocacy on behalf of super storm sandy victims. it is my hope that this measure will receive speedy passage in the senate so it can be signed by president obama, and survivors of super storm sandy can finally recover for this horrific act of god. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1471, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",74512

In my district, our prayers and deep sympathy are with the loved ones of Larry Turner, Devine Stringfield, and Ian Lewis, who tragically lost their lives after their home was destroyed by the tornado that ripped through Waverly, Virginia, on Wednesday, February 24, 2016. Our thoughts and prayers are also with the many who were injured and whose daily lives were disrupted or, in some instances, permanently altered by this storm. As communities, we extend our deep gratitude to our local law enforcement, first responders, and emergency personnel for their quick, courageous, and compassionate response in the aftermath of these storms. We are proud, though not surprised, by the way citizens and communities in Virginia and across the East Coast are coming together to support those most affected. Mr. Speaker, please join me in a moment of silence honoring those who lost their lives, their loved ones, the entire Waverly community, and all those across Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana who have been impacted by this storm. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Page H1034] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE LIVES LOST IN THE STORM OF FEBRUARY 2016 (Mr. FORBES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Officer Ashley Guindon, a law enforcement officer and Marine Corps Reserve veteran who answered the call to serve her community and her country. In her heart, Officer Guindon was a guardian. She was willing to step into the breach to protect others. On Saturday, February 27, one day, Mr. Speaker, after Officer Guindon was sworn in as an officer with the Prince William County Police Department, she did just that. While responding to a call for help from a domestic violence victim, Officer Guindon was shot and killed by a gunman who had already taken the life of his wife, Crystal Hamilton, a loving mother who cared for our Nation's wounded warriors. I ask that my colleagues join me in mourning the victims of this latest gun tragedy and, also, in paying tribute to the men and women in law enforcement who give more to this world than they ever ask in return.

Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Rare Disease Day to raise awareness about this important issue and to advocate for those who are impacted. A medical condition is considered rare if fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. are known to be living with that particular disease. But while each disease affects a relatively small segment of the population, with over 7,000 different diseases that fall into this category, rare diseases are not uncommon. In fact, 1 in 10 Americans is affected. I want to commend our researchers at the NIH and in hospitals and research facilities in my district and across the U.S. who have risen to the distinct challenges posed by rare diseases. These men and women work tirelessly to remain on the cutting edge of medical breakthrough in their search for new treatments and cures, and they deserve our full support. So, too, do the parents, advocates, and those afflicted who spend their time raising awareness and educating policymakers on issues impacting rare diseases. I also want to remind us all that there is much left to be accomplished. In the time it takes for one new drug to be developed, tested, and approved for general use, countless other diseases have been newly discovered, leaving us with more questions than answers. That is why the House has taken a critical step by passing the 21st Century Cures Act. [[Page H1035]] As a member of the Rare Disease Caucus, I urge my colleagues in both Chambers to advance this bipartisan initiative.

Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, today we learned of the Obama administration's decision to renegotiate a set of export controls that could have been hugely detrimental to our national security. I want to thank President Obama for his leadership on cybersecurity generally and specifically on this issue. In 2013, Wassenaar member states added intrusion software to the list of export-controlled products. While the addition was well-intentioned, since we certainly do not want companies making a profit selling hacking tools to repressive regimes, the language used was simply too broad and encompassed vital cybersecurity tools and even fundamental vulnerability research. The plan to renegotiate is the culmination of a months-long process involving industry, a number of agencies, and 124 of my colleagues in this Chamber. Mr. Speaker, I deeply appreciate the work of the Bureau of Industry and Security in shepherding this process and the National Security Council for pushing for its resolution. Now, we still have work to do with our international partners, but today is a validation of our ability to come together, government and industry, to address difficult challenges in cybersecurity policy. This is a good news story. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Page H1035] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RENEGOTIATION OF WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT INTRUSION SOFTWARE CONTROLS (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the story of Kendra Kilroy of Quincy, Massachusetts, one of tens of thousands of women harmed by the permanent sterilization device Essure. Because of Essure, she has lived in debilitating pain. She has lived in anxiety, thinking maybe her doctor was right and her symptoms were really just in her head. She lived in sadness, missing out on field trips, school plays, and a Christmas concert for her children because she was too sick and too tired. Mostly, she lived in anger, finding out that the Essure coil was migrating through her fallopian tube and into her body. She now lives in hope, knowing we have people fighting with and for us to protect so many women from the same fate. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a voice for the Essure sisters, to tell this Chamber that their stories are real, their pain is real, and their fight is real. My bill, the E-Free Act, can halt this tragedy by removing this dangerous device from the market. Too many women have been harmed.

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Peace Corps volunteers are America's angels abroad. These unique volunteers are some of our best diplomats. They travel to the ends of the Earth to spread the message of democracy in lands far, far away. Sometimes they work alone, and they help in remote regions of the world, areas where most of us could not even locate with Google Maps. They help small villages with sanitation and lack of water, for instance, and they do it all with great passion. These volunteers are called to serve. However, we must serve and protect these volunteers as well. Sometimes bad things happen to Peace Corps volunteers overseas. If so, America must help with medical services. We must help with care and counseling if they are assaulted in a foreign country. That is why Congress passed the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011. But Congress must continue to advocate for victims in the Peace Corps.

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Peace Corps volunteers are America's angels abroad. These unique volunteers are some of our best diplomats. They travel to the ends of the Earth to spread the message of democracy in lands far, far away. Sometimes they work alone, and they help in remote regions of the world, areas where most of us could not even locate with Google Maps. They help small villages with sanitation and lack of water, for instance, and they do it all with great passion. These volunteers are called to serve. However, we must serve and protect these volunteers as well. Sometimes bad things happen to Peace Corps volunteers overseas. If so, America must help with medical services. We must help with care and counseling if they are assaulted in a foreign country. That is why Congress passed the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011.

AmpliVox has been providing the community with innovative sound systems since the 1950s and has grown to become an industry leader. In the past 5 years, the company's revenue grew by over 60 percent. Most admirably, throughout this growth, the company has not lost sight of the community it serves. CEO Don Roth sets an example for small businesses across the Nation through his integrity, vision, and emphasis on community involvement. Small businesses like AmpliVox are truly the backbone of our economy and our communities. Unfortunately, backwards Federal regulations are making it harder and harder for small businesses to thrive and create more jobs. I am committed to doing all that I can in this body to support small businesses and get more people back to work. Congratulations, again, to AmpliVox Sound Systems and Don Roth.

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgH1037-2,CREC-2016-02-29,114,SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1037-H1043] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1915 SUPREME COURT VACANCY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to once again stand on the floor of the House of Representatives along with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, coanchor of this CBC Special Order hour, this hour of power where, for the next 60 minutes, we will have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about an issue of grave importance to the integrity of our democracy, and that is making sure that the United States Senate fulfills their constitutional obligation to advise and consent as it relates to considering any Supreme Court nomination that President Obama sends up to that body. We know that Justice Antonin Scalia has moved on after a long and distinguished career. Though I disagree with almost every single judicial opinion that he has issued, he served this Nation well. Now that he has moved on, the Supreme Court, which is contained in Article III of the United States Constitution, has a vacancy. It is the obligation of the United States Senate to fill that vacancy by considering whatever nominee President Barack Obama sends forward. Members of the United States Senate take an oath of office to faithfully discharge their responsibilities. When you look at Article II, section 2, of the United States Constitution, which gives the President the power to nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, it is the Senate that must consider that nominee. Since the early part of the 20th century, there have been eight different Supreme Court nominees who have been voted on in an election year. Six of them actually were confirmed, but all eight of them received a hearing. So, for the life of me, I can't figure out why Senator Mitch McConnell thinks that he can get away with holding a nomination up without even the slightest bit of consideration. So we are going to explore that here today. We will be joined by any number of distinguished Members of the House of Representatives and the Congressional Black Caucus, but let me proceed by yielding to my good friend and colleague from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my dynamic coanchor who does such a tremendous job on behalf of the people of the great State of Ohio and the city of Columbus. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries. It is certainly an honor and a privilege for me to join you this evening as coanchor for this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. Congressman Jeffries' scholarship and distinguished talents as a member of the Judiciary Committee have not gone unnoticed. I thank him for leading by example in challenging us to initiate and follow through in sending a message on Senate Republicans' refusal to act on the Supreme Court vacancy. In part, tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Senate Republicans: Do Your Job, does just that. As you reflected in your opening statement, Article II, section 2, of the Constitution expressly designates that the President has a duty to name and the Senate has a responsibility to advise and consent a nominee to fill the seat. President Obama takes this very seriously. He has stated: ``It's a decision to which I devote considerable time, deep reflection, careful deliberation, and serious consultation with legal experts, members of both political parties, and people across the political spectrum.'' But Republicans have made a decision to completely refuse consideration of anyone that President Obama nominates to the Supreme Court. In fact, they have stated that they won't hold a hearing or a vote before the full Senate. Senate Democrats never acted so recklessly when faced with this situation in 1988, when there was a vote to confirm Justice Kennedy. There was no talk of doing nothing until after that year's election because it was unthinkable then to leave the Court shorthanded for that long. And it remains so now. The power of the Court, Mr. Speaker, is reflected in the work it does. Its decisions often shape the policy as profoundly as any law passed by Congress or any action taken by the President of these United States. When we look back to our history, especially as African Americans, the importance of the decisions handed down by the Supreme Court cannot be overstated. For example, most of us are familiar with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which reversed Plessy v. Ferguson and its ``separate but equal'' ruling. Striking down segregation in our Nation's public schools provided a major catalyst for the civil rights movement and made advances in desegregating housing, public accommodations, and institutions of higher education possible. After Brown, the Nation made some great strides towards opening the doors of education to all students. Unfortunately, the promise of the Brown decision remains unfulfilled in many ways. More than 2 million Black students attend schools where 90 percent of the student body is made up of minority students. On average, schools serving more minority populations have less experienced, lower paid teachers who are less likely to be certified. A report from the Center for American Progress found that a 10 percent point increase in students of color at a school is associated with a decrease in per-pupil spending of $75. In many ways, more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education school systems in the United States are still separate and unequal. And we are just not witnessing educational disparities at the elementary and secondary education level. College enrollment is racially polarized. White students are overrepresented in selective colleges, which have more resources to educate and to support them, while African American students are overrepresented in less selective institutions. Mr. Speaker and Congressman Jeffries, you see where I am going with that. [[Page H1038]] This is also why the late Justice Scalia's comments during oral arguments of the pending United States Supreme Court case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, were so disturbing. He stated, in part: Maybe the University of Texas ought to have fewer African Americans. These comments are inaccurate and insulting to me and to African Americans. They undervalue the historic achievement that African Americans have made. Thousands of Black Americans have excelled to the top tier of their universities. Many of them you will hear from tonight because they are members of the Congressional Black Caucus. They are scholars. They are the conscience of the Congress. They represent the diversity of America's best universities and of America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her wonderful thoughts and observations, and I look forward to our continued dialogue. It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), one of those individuals that Representative Beatty mentioned who is really a legal giant amongst us. He is someone who has served this institution well. He understands the Constitution, the notion of separation of powers, and the importance of a fair and equitable justice system. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing tonight's Special Order to call on our colleagues in the Senate to do their job and provide their advice and consent on the President's upcoming nomination to the United States Supreme Court. The Constitution is pretty clear on this issue. Article II, Section 2, doesn't say the President might or the President should. It says the President shall nominate, and by and with advice and consent of the Senate, appoint judges to the Supreme Court. There seems to be some suggestion that, if it is an election year, he ought to skip that process and let the next President make the appointment. They say there is very little precedence for a President nominating somebody in an election year. That might be technically correct, but the fact of the matter is that there have been virtually no vacancies that have occurred during an election year. I think the last one was about almost 50 years. In that case, an appointment was made and considered. That is the process that ought to take place in this case. The rarity of such an event should not preclude the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. There is precedent for the President nominating and the Senate at least considering the nomination during an election year. Now, Justice Kennedy was confirmed in an election year in 1988. That was a 7-month process that began with the appointment of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. His nomination was considered and defeated. And then there was the appointment of Douglas Ginsburg. We will just say his nomination went up in smoke. And then we had the nomination and confirmation of Justice Kennedy. In 7 months, from start to finish, another nomination was made and collapsed and another nomination made, all within 7 months. We could complete that entire process by the first Monday in October, the beginning of the Supreme Court session. There is no precedence for the President declining to nominate somebody and virtually no precedence for the Senate just to ignore a nomination that is made. The people overwhelmingly reelected President Obama in 2012 to a term that does not end until January 20, 2017, and we fully expect the President to fulfill his duty to nominate a qualified individual to the Supreme Court to fill the current vacancy. A failure of the Senate to act this year would be unprecedented. There is ample time for that to take place. The longest confirmation process for a single nominee has been 125 days. On historic average, it takes 25 days to confirm or reject a nominee. As of today, the Senate has 216 days until the first Monday in October. If the Senate were to refuse to consider any of President Obama's nominations--and they have said they want the next President to make the appointment--there has been no indication that they will give expedited consideration to the next President's nomination. It could be well into the next year by the time the new Justice is confirmed and sworn in. Even on an expedited schedule, the new President would not be able to nominate anyone until they are sworn in on January 20. The Senate Judiciary Committee would need time to prepare for hearings, which could not occur until probably February. And then the full Senate would need time to consider the nomination, with the confirmation not likely until probably March. {time} 1930 Now, by March of a term, the term is effectively about over. Most of the oral arguments have already taken place and they are into decisions. You can't participate in a decision if you skip the oral argument. So not only would the vacancy occur through the rest of this term, almost half of a Supreme Court term, it would be well into the next term and, effectively, through most of the next term. There is no excuse to leave the Court vacancy open in what then would be a historic new precedence. There is no precedence for keeping a vacancy open that long. We need the justice appointed. The Senate ought to do its job. The President has indicated that he will do his job, as mandated by the Constitution, and so the Senate ought to just fulfill its responsibility under the Constitution and consider an appointment. Otherwise, you will have a vacancy not only through the rest of this term--and oral arguments have been taking place--you will have the vacancy through the rest of this term. You don't need a vacancy through the entire rest of the next term. There is plenty of time to consider and vote up or down on a nomination. And the unprecedented vacancy that would occur if the Senate fulfills its threat to stonewall any nomination is just unprecedented. So I want to thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for giving us the opportunity to just say a word about the importance of everyone in our democracy fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. The President shall appoint, and the Senate shall consider, advise and consent, so that we can have a Supreme Court Justice appointed before the first Monday in October. We have plenty of time to do that. There is no excuse for not doing it, and we expect the Senate to do its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia for highlighting several important points, including the fact that there is no election year exception in Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. This is all in Mitch McConnell's mind, cooked up in some partisan laboratory in order to stop this President from being able to move forward and do the business of the American people. We shouldn't be surprised, because we know Mitch McConnell stated very early on that his objective was to grind everything to a halt here in the Capitol to try to prevent President Obama from being re-elected. Not my words, his words. But here's the thing. President Obama was re-elected in an electoral college landslide. And his opponent in that race, Mitt Romney, tried to make it, in part, an election that was a referendum on the possibility that President Obama would have the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. That issue was laid before the American people by President Obama's opponent, and the American people responded, processed all of the facts, and decided to re-elect President Obama, send him back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The American people did their job. The President is prepared to do his job. The Senate Republicans need to do their job as well. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to someone who has been a stalwart for justice in this institution, a revered Member of the House of Representatives, the great whip of House Democrats, and someone who has the respect of everyone in the United [[Page H1039]] States Capitol and beyond for his service to the House and his service to the country, a great friend to the Congressional Black Caucus, and we are so thankful that he is present here today. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York (Mr. Jeffries) for his excellent presentation. I want to thank Mr. Scott, who, as the gentleman observed, is one of the leaders in this Congress on the Constitution and on the law and on equal justice. I want to thank my friend from Ohio, the gentlewoman from Ohio, for her remarks. I noticed that the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, formerly a judge on the Court in North Carolina, is here. Mr. Speaker, I want to first say that I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for sponsoring this Special Order. I want to tell every Member, and all Americans ought to know, this is not an issue related to one group, to one gender, to one race, to one nationality. The failure to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court will affect every American. So we rise tonight to ask the Senate to do its duty. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here on the floor this evening with my distinguished colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order. The Supreme Court now has a vacancy, as everyone knows, that must be filled. The American people deserve a Supreme Court operating at full strength. Mr. Speaker, I am old enough to have been alive at the time that John Kennedy was assassinated. Within hours of his death, we swore in Lyndon Johnson as President of the United States because we wanted to make sure that there was a continuity of service. As sad and as tragic as those hours were, the responsibility of having a President of the United States was met within just a few hours. Mr. Speaker, when a vacancy occurs in this House--and there are, after all, 434 of us left when that happens--the State laws put a time limit on the Governors' action to call an election so that that vacancy can be filled. Why? Because the Constitution of those States do not want to have a vacancy exist for very long and have their State or their district not represented. Now, there is not a time limit with respect to the Supreme Court, per se. And the reason for that, of course, is the process, as Mr. Scott just pointed out, sometimes take a little longer, sometimes takes a little shorter. But in 7 months, as the gentleman pointed out, they had three nominees considered. Two were defeated after debate and a vote, and the third was confirmed. The process worked, and it worked in the last year of an administration. President Obama has a constitutional responsibility to nominate a candidate for the Court that will exercise sound judgment, uphold the principle that all people are created equal and must be treated equally under the laws. The Founders of our country very wisely made the number on the Supreme Court an odd number, not an even number, because the Founders did not want gridlock. Now we are used to gridlock in this Congress. But they did not want gridlock on the Court, and so they provided for a decision to be made by five members out of nine. Now, however, with four and four, they will maybe not be able to make a decision. That was not contemplated by the Founders, nor would it have been welcomed by the Founders. Shamefully, Senate Republicans have said they have no intention of even meeting with a nominee put forward by President Obama. That is not only disrespectful of the President of the United States, Barack Obama, but it is contrary to the best interest of the Supreme Court, but more importantly, to the people of this country. It is appalling that Republicans would prefer to leave a vacancy on the Supreme Court, thereby rendering it in some cases unable to make a decision, unable to perform its duties of being the final arbiter when circuits may differ on an issue. If Members of one party or another were simply to ignore the other side and refuse to carry out their duties within a divided government, our democracy would break down, and in some respects it has. We ought not to carry that conduct to the Supreme Court. We must not let that happen and we must not allow this Supreme Court vacancy to remain unfilled. The Court currently has a number, as the gentleman from New York has pointed out, of major cases pending that require a decision; not to be remanded to a lower court, because if that is done, that judgment may stand for that circuit, but there will be other circuits around the country who may make a different decision. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court has been a powerful safeguard of American's liberty and equality over the past century and beyond. From recognizing the right of every child to attend desegregated schools, to protecting every loving couple who wishes to marry, the Court has breathed life into the words of our Declaration of Independence that all are ``created equal, and they are endowed by their Creator,'' not by us, not by the Constitution, ``by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.'' That may be self-evident, Mr. Speaker, but it is not self-executed. And we have established the Supreme Court of the United States to make a decision so that that can be realized. Melissa Hart, Director of the Byron White Center, a former member of the Supreme Court for Constitutional Law at the University of Denver said, if we don't act, ``It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve legal questions.'' Caroline Frederickson, president of the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy, wrote on February 19, ``It would be unfathomable to go through this term,'' and as Mr. Scott pointed out, the next term, ``with a Supreme Court hobbled by a vacancy.'' Mr. Speaker, let me remind you again, if a President dies, immediately we fill the vacancy. If a Member of Congress dies, every State has a time limit in which that must be filled so that democracy can be represented and operate in the way our Founders wanted it to operate. When the President nominates a candidate to the Court, the Senate, in my view, Mr. Speaker, has a responsibility under the Constitution to give that nominee every due consideration. They do not have a constitutional responsibility to approve it, as Mr. Scott has pointed out, but they have a responsibility to consider it. We must not allow politics, we must not allow politics, we must not allow politics to allow the obstruction of this most essential institution of our democracy and the rule of law. I want to thank my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for leading this Special Order and for their efforts to hold Senate Republicans accountable for their blatantly irresponsible action on this matter. Mr. Speaker, there is always another election. It may be 2 years away, it may be 4 years away, but if we adopt the principle that if we don't think we can win now, we will obstruct now and hope to win later, America and Americans will not be well-served. I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Democratic whip for a very insightful and powerful observation, for pointing that the very fabric of the United States Constitution is threatened by the willingness of Senate Republicans to abdicate their legislative responsibilities to hold hearings and act on a nomination put forth by the President of the United States of America. {time} 1945 It is now my great honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, as was pointed out by Mr. Hoyer, a former prominent member of the North Carolina judiciary, a legal scholar, a historian, and, of course, the leader of the conscience of the Congress here in the United States House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the chairman, G.K. Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me begin tonight by thanking the gentleman, Mr. Jeffries, for yielding to [[Page H1040]] me this evening and to thank him for his extraordinary friendship and leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. I want to publicly thank you for coming to my district this past weekend. You spoke--some would say you preached--at Mount Vernon Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina, and I thank you so very much for the message that you brought to my constituents in North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, moments after the death of Justice Scalia, the majority leader of the United States Senate announced to the country in a tone of defiance that the Senate will not consider any nomination--any nomination--of President Barack Obama to replace Justice Scalia. Mr. Speaker, the American people can see right through this. Though I represent a Democratic-leaning district in North Carolina, I represent many Republicans in North Carolina. Many of them have told me how disappointed they are with the Senate Republican leadership in making this announcement. Senator McConnell is reinforcing the Republican political agenda to disrupt--to disrupt--governmental functions when the circumstances do not line up with their conservative philosophy. It is imperative that we have nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court deciding constitutional issues that are important to the American people. The irony in all of this is that my Republican friends constantly on this floor talk about strict construction of the Constitution. A strict construction of the Constitution, as Mr. Hoyer said a moment ago, requires the President to nominate an individual once there is a vacancy on the Court. The Senate, the United States Senate, has the awesome responsibility of having a hearing, deciding, and confirming the nomination by an up-or-down vote. So it is absurd to suggest that President Obama should be denied the opportunity to nominate a qualified Justice to replace Justice Scalia. The American people should clearly understand that Senate Republicans have a political agenda to pack the Court with conservative Justices who would reverse years of commonsense progressive jurisprudence. So the Congressional Black Caucus tonight demands Senate Republicans to stop the complete blockade and the blatant disrespect of our President. Senate Republicans' outright refusal to hold a hearing on any individual nominated by the President to serve on the Court is an affront to our Constitution and the American people. Such divisive actions undermine our democracy and reduce our standing in the world. This blockade is an obstruction and runs afoul of the duties held by those who hold a seat in the august Chamber of the United States Senate. I have read that Senator Grassley, Senator McConnell, and others will meet with President Obama this week. I hope they meet. I hope they sit together and reconcile their differences because this issue needs to be put to rest. We call on Senate Republicans to hold hearings once President Obama submits his nomination and follow the procedures set forth in the Constitution. In short and in closing, the Congressional Black Caucus, the 45, 46 members of the Congressional Black Caucus--and, indeed, the American people--have one message--one message--for Senate Republicans: Do your job. Don't play partisanship. Don't play a partisan game with the Supreme Court of the United States of America. It is too serious. It is too important. Thank you very much, Mr. Jeffries. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished chair for pointing out that this is a simple question for Senate Republicans: Do your job consistent with your obligations and responsibilities under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. The Senate Republicans' failure to act or consider any nominee put forth by the President of the United States of America is an abdication of responsibility, a dereliction of duty, and it would be a stunning act of legislative malpractice that undermines the rule of law, the Presidency, the Supreme Court, the United States Constitution, as well as the American people. I am thankful now to be joined by someone who is a powerful voice for the voiceless here in the House of Representatives, who has ably served her constituents in northern California and consistently fought for a fair, equitable society. Let me now yield to my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from California, Representative Barbara Lee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from New York for yielding, but also for his tremendous leadership. You and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty from Ohio really have sounded the alarm, beat the drum, and really brought to the American people the important issues that we are dealing with each and every day, so I just have to thank you for your diligence and for staying the course. Every week you are here, you are representing not only this Congress, but the country very, very well. So thank you. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with all my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus, with our whip, Mr. Hoyer, and others to urge our Republican colleagues in the Senate to, of course, do your job. Also, let me just remind us, once again, the President is trying to meet his constitutional obligation once again. He is trying to do what he is supposed to do, and that is to nominate Justice Scalia's replacement to our Nation's highest Court. And Senate Republicans have a constitutional responsibility to give the President's nominee a speedy and fair hearing, followed up with a simple up-or-down vote. Sadly, these Senate Republicans said ``no'' to their constitutional responsibility. The Supreme Court has a huge responsibility of deciding cases that impact every aspect of American life, from our elections, college admissions, to scientific patents and a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions. It is imperative that the Supreme Court be allowed to function in its full capacity with nine Justices. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was appointed by a conservative President, President Ronald Reagan, did not mince words in her condemnation of Republicans playing politics with the Court. She said: ``We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it.'' Former Justice O'Connor, I could not agree more. Despite the calls for action and a constitutional mandate, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said that there will be no hearings, no votes, not even a meeting with President Obama to discuss the late Justice Scalia's replacement. That is just wrong. His actions prompted The New York Times to editorialize that he ``seems to have lost touch with reality and the Constitution,'' speaking of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a couple of New York Times articles. [From the New York Times, Feb. 17, 2016] Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor (By Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin) Charleston, SC.--As he left Martha Lou's Kitchen, a soul food institution here on Wednesday, Edward Gadsden expressed irritation about the Republican determination to block President Obama from selecting Justice Antonin Scalia's replacement on the Supreme Court. ``They've been fighting that man since he's been there,'' Mr. Gadsden, who is African-American, said of Mr. Obama, before pointing at his forearm to explain what he said was driving the Republican opposition: ``The color of his skin, that's all, the color of his skin.'' When Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after Mr. Scalia's death on Saturday that the next president, rather than Mr. Obama, should select a successor, the senator's words struck a familiar and painful chord with many black voters. After years of watching political opponents question the president's birthplace and his faith, and hearing a member of Congress shout ``You lie!'' at him from the House floor, some African-Americans saw the move by Senate Republicans as another attempt to deny the legitimacy of the country's first black president. And they call it increasingly infuriating after Mr. Obama has spent seven years in the White House and won two resounding election victories. ``Our president, the president of the United States, has been disrespected from Day 1,'' Carol Richardson, 61, said on Wednesday as she colored a customer's hair at Ultra Beauty Saloh in Hollywood, S.C., a mostly black town near Charleston. ``The words that have been said, the things the Republicans have done they'd have never have done to another president. Let's talk like it is, it's because of his skin color.'' [[Page H1041]] Reflecting on the Supreme Court vacancy, Bakari Sellers, a former state representative from Denmark, S.C., likened the Senate treatment of the president to the 18th century constitutional compromise that counted black men as equivalent to three-fifths of a person. ``I guess many of them are using this in the strictest construction that Barack Obama's serving three-fifths of a term or he's three-fifths of a human being, so he doesn't get to make this choice,'' Mr. Sellers said. ``It's infuriating.'' The anger and outrage that Mr. McConnell's position has touched off among African-Americans could have implications for the presidential election. Leading African-American Democrats are trying to use it to motivate rank-and-file blacks to vote in November, the first presidential election in a decade in which Mr. Obama will not be on the ballot and in which Democrats fear black participation could drop. ``Anger becomes action when it's directly tied to a moment, and the moment now is the election on Nov. 8,'' said Stacey Abrams, a Democratic state representative from Georgia and the House minority leader there, adding that Mr. Scalia's death meant that this presidential campaign could no longer be construed as a mere ``thought exercise.'' For Hillary Clinton, who is increasingly relying on nonwhite voters to ensure her success against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the court issue could be especially crucial. Should she defeat Mr. Sanders, who has electrified many liberals, she will need a motivating issue to bring Mr. Obama's loyalists to the polls. She moved swiftly Tuesday to tap into the anger of blacks over the opposition of Senate Republicans to Mr. Obama's naming a replacement for Justice Scalia. ``Now the Republicans say they'll reject anyone President Obama nominates no matter how qualified,'' Mrs. Clinton said in remarks before a predominantly black audience in Harlem. ``Some are even saying he doesn't have the right to nominate anyone! As if somehow he's not the real president.'' Doing so, Mrs. Clinton added, is in keeping with a longstanding pattern of mistreatment. ``They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe,'' she said. ``This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.'' Republicans are especially sensitive about the notion that they are diminishing Mr. Obama because of his race, and spokesmen for several Republican senators, including Mr. McConnell and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, declined to comment or would not make the senators available for comment. The suggestion that racism is playing a role angers Mr. McConnell's friends, who point out that his formative political experience was working for a Republican senator who supported civil rights, that he helped override President Ronald Reagan's veto of sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa and that he is married to an Asian-American woman. But in the aftermath of Mr. McConnell's statement on Saturday, a growing chorus of black voices is complaining that such a refusal to even consider a Supreme Court nominee would never occur with a white president. ``It's more than a political motive--it has a smell of racism,'' said Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``I can tick instance after instance over the last seven years where Republicans have purposely tried to diminish the president's authority,'' Mr. Butterfield said. ``This is just really extreme, and leads me to the conclusion that if this was any other president who was not African-American, it would not have been handled this way.'' Even as Mr. Obama's popularity has risen and fallen, his base of support among black voters has been unshakable. A Gallup tracking poll this month showed that some 85 percent of African-Americans approved of the president's performance compared with only 36 percent of whites. And many African- Americans strongly identify personally with Mr. Obama, and have watched his tenure with pride. Mr. Butterfield said that he believed that the effort to undermine, and even delegitimize, Mr. Obama began soon after he was sworn in, and that Congressional Republicans had blocked Mr. Obama's agenda wherever they could. Even more stinging were the suggestions from some on the right that Mr. Obama, a Christian, is actually a Muslim and that he was not born in the United States. In interviews, members of the Congressional Black Caucus also bitterly recounted indignities, such as demands--most pointedly from the current Republican front-runner in the polls, Donald J. Trump, in 2011--that Mr. Obama prove he was born in Hawaii, and not in Kenya, as some critics claimed. Others recalled the calls to impeach Mr. Obama over his use of executive authority. ``You hear the thing about: `He's not a citizen. He oversteps his bounds. He's divisive.' One thing after another,'' said Representative Marcia L. Fudge, Democrat of Ohio. ``This has been going on since the day he was elected in 2008.'' Republicans have had more success than Democrats in recent decades galvanizing their voters over who should control the courts. But Jennifer McClellan, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Democratic National Committee, said the dispute over how to replace Justice Scalia could now become ``an issue for the average citizen.'' Ms. Abrams agreed, saying the Supreme Court and its powerful influence on people's lives is especially resonant with blacks. ``Congress is denying our president his rights as a president, but, more than that, they're denying the legacy of his presidency,'' she said. ``That will animate Democratic voters across the board but especially African- Americans, who realize more than many voters how great an impact the Supreme Court can have on freedom.'' ____ [From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 2016] Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat (By the Editorial Board) Following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Republicans apparently believe they can profit by creating a political crisis that the nation has never seen before. On Tuesday, the leadership doubled down on its refusal to take any action on any nominee from President Obama to replace Justice Scalia. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader who seems to have lost touch with reality and the Constitution, accused Mr. Obama of plunging the nation into a ``bitter and avoidable struggle'' should he name anyone to the court. Forget an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Top Republicans are pledging not to hold hearings or even to meet with a nominee. In a statement dripping with sarcasm, Mr. McConnell said that Mr. Obama ``has every right to nominate someone,'' and ``even if doing so will inevitably plunge our nation into another bitter and avoidable struggle, that is his right. Even if he never expects that nominee to actually be confirmed but rather to wield as an electoral cudgel, that is his right.'' Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, said, ``We believe the American people need to decide who is going to make this appointment rather than a lame-duck president.'' These statements are so twisted that it's hard to know where to begin. Let's take them one by one. First, Mr. Obama is not a ``lame-duck president.'' The lame-duck period is broadly understood to run from after the November election until a new president is inaugurated in January. November is more than eight months off. Based on the average number of days it has taken the Senate to act on previous Supreme Court nominees, the seat could be filled by this spring. Second, no matter how often Republicans repeat the phrase ``let the people decide,'' that's not how the system works. The Constitution vests the power to make nominations to the court in the president, not ``the people.'' In any case, the people have already decided who should make this appointment: They elected Mr. Obama twice, by large margins. Third, it is preposterous to accuse Mr. Obama of causing a ``bitter struggle'' by nominating someone who will not be confirmed. The only reason a nominee would not be confirmed is that the Senate has pre-emptively decided to block any nominee sight unseen. Mr. Obama is once again the only adult in the room, carrying out his constitutional obligation while Senate Republicans scramble to dig up examples of Democrats trying to block nominees. But those examples show only that Democratic senators have pushed hard for Republican presidents to pick ideologically moderate nominees. Until now, neither party has ever vowed to shut down the nomination process entirely, even before it has begun. Only two Republican senators, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine, were brave enough to say that they would vote on President Obama's nominee. This is what passes for moderation in today's G.O.P.: simply stating a willingness to do the job you were elected to do. Unfortunately, for too many Republicans moderation now equals apostasy. These Republicans have stubbornly parked themselves so far to the right for so many years that it is hard to tell whether they can hear how deranged they sound. The truth is they are afraid--and they should be. They know Mr. Obama has a large pool of extremely smart and thoroughly mainstream candidates from which to choose a nominee. They know that if the American people were allowed to hear such a person answer questions in a Senate hearing, they would wonder what all the fuss was about. So Mr. McConnell and his colleagues plan to shut their doors, plug their ears and hope the public doesn't notice. The Republican spin machine is working overtime to rationalize this behavior. Don't be fooled. It is panic masquerading as strength. Ms. LEE. One of the titles of these articles is ``Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor.'' The other is The New York Times article, ``Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat.'' Likewise, Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley of Iowa led a letter to the majority leader signed by all the Republican Committee members confirming their resolve to not have hearings or a vote on the nominee. [[Page H1042]] This is downright ludicrous. Republicans cannot and should not use the Supreme Court to push their radical political agenda. The Constitution is clear, Mr. Speaker. Article II, section 2, ``He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . . . shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court.'' Nowhere in the Constitution does it say, ``except in an election year'' or ``except when the President is a Democrat'' or ``when Republicans have spent the last 7 years actively working to subvert every policy proposed by a President elected by nearly 70 million Americans.'' The Constitution doesn't say that. This is simply unacceptable, and the American people deserve better. For more than a century, every single Supreme Court nominee has received a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Just like all the Presidents before him, President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice, and the Senate should determine if he or she is fit to serve on this Nation's High Court. Instead, Republicans are holding the Supreme Court and the American people hostage. Their action, in the words of The New York Times, is simply, ``panic masquerading as strength.'' The Senate has a responsibility to at least consider the President's Supreme Court nominee, and by refusing to do so, they are failing their constituents and their Nation. So, Mr. Speaker, it is really past time for Majority Leader McConnell and the rest of the Republican leadership to do their jobs and work together to get a new Supreme Court Justice. The Supreme Court is way too important to be used as a political bargaining chip. Enough is enough. So, once again, I join my colleagues, Congressman Jeffries, Congresswoman Beatty, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and the American people in saying, ``Do your job.'' Once again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join with you tonight. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California for making several important points as it relates to the absence of any partisanship exception in the United States Constitution, the absence of any exception whereby the Senate will do its job unless, of course, President Barack Obama happens to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I see that nowhere within the four corners of the United States Constitution. I don't see an election year exception in the United States Constitution. So I am perplexed as to what is the situation we find ourselves in right now. I thought that I may ask the distinguished gentlewoman, my colleague, my coanchor from Ohio, to reflect upon, if you might, a few comments that could shed light on the situation we find ourselves in right now as it relates to the Supreme Court vacancy made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over the years during his time here in Congress. In 1986, Mitch McConnell said: ``I believe that a heavy burden must be met by those who would have this nominee rejected. Under the Constitution, our duty is to provide advice and consent to judicial nominations, not to substitute our judgment for what are reasonable views for a judicial nominee to hold.'' That was in 1986. Then in 1990, he said: ``It is clear under our form of government that the advice and consent role of the Senate in judicial nominations should not be politicized.'' That was Mitch McConnell in 1990. In 2005, he said: ``Our job is to react to that nomination in a respectful and dignified way, and at the end of the process, to give that person an up-or-down vote as all nominees who have majority support have gotten throughout the history of the country.'' I am trying to figure out what has changed, Representative Beatty. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries. Hearing you quote those things, three things come to mind. First, let me say that Congressman Steny Hoyer was absolutely right when he says that this issue of not filling the vacancy is not related to only one group. So I want to say, after hearing what you said and many others of our members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is important for us to know why we are calling on the Senate Republicans to do their job, and that is because we are the voice for those who are not often represented. We are the voice for those when you talk about issues related to women and women's rights, when you talk about issues that are related to things that affect you and me, and when you talk about the article that Congresswoman Barbara Lee entered into the Record, ``Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor.'' Now, that article says it all. That article specifically states that many folks believe, in this wonderful America that we live in, that it is also because of the color of his skin. I think that is another reason that we come as a strong 46 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, because the facts work against them. Think about it. When we look at the number of people who have been appointed, when we look at the number of days, if you look at since 1975, it has only taken an average of 67 days to confirm a President's nominee to the Supreme Court. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, and there are 325 days left in President Obama's term. {time} 2000 Since the early 1900s, six Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in an election year. When I think about your question and I think about your sharing with us some of the comments that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said, let me add this one to the Record. And it is something he got right. He said that the American people should have the right to choose the President who will pick the next Supreme Court Justice deciding the future balance of the Nation's highest court. Well, he got that right. Because you know what. The people did pick the President when they picked President Barack Obama in 2012, who won the election by 5 million votes. I am calling on him and the Senate Republicans to do their job, to allow the President to do what the Constitution tells us, to allow the President, who has already said that he is going to bring somebody who is full of scholarship, he is going to bring someone who is committed and capable to doing the people's work--I wanted to add that to your statement and share with everyone tonight that is why we are here. Mr. JEFFRIES. I really appreciate that. As we are simply trying to point out, all we are asking for is for the Senate to adhere to its constitutional responsibilities and, when the President sends forth a nominee, to conduct a rigorous hearing process before the American people and then, at the end of that process, provide that nominee with an up-or-down vote before the Judiciary Committee and then, ultimately, the floor of the United States Senate. Now, I have been in this institution for a little over 3 years. If I had a dollar for every time some of my colleagues mentioned strict adherence to the United States Constitution, I would be a billionaire right now. For the life of me, I can't understand what is so complicated about this particular issue. As Representative Beatty so ably pointed out, from this moment, there are 325 days remaining in the Presidency of Barack Obama. As this chart illustrates, if you just take a look at the current occupants of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice, the most important position on the Supreme Court, a 23-day confirmation process; Justice Scalia, confirmed in 85 days; Justice Kagan, 87 days; Justice Sotomayor, 66 days; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a/k/a the notorious RBG--one of my personal favorites--50 days; Justice Clarence Thomas, 99 days. You can add some of these confirmation periods together and you still wouldn't get to 325. So what is the problem? Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining on my Special Order today? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 12 minutes remaining. [[Page H1043]] General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, one of the concerns that I think we in the Congressional Black Caucus have as it relates to the Presidency of President Obama--and Representative Beatty pointed this out--is that there is a feeling in many corners of America that this President is treated differently. I am not sure if it is because there are some people here in the Capitol who have something against folks from Hawaii. I am not sure if it is his Kansas roots. I don't know if they dislike the fact that he was a community organizer in terms of one of the jobs that he held after school. I don't know if they dislike the fact that he is so well educated from Columbia and Harvard Law Schools. I don't know if it is the fact that he was the President of the Harvard Law Review or a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, one of the top five law schools in this country. I don't really know what it is about Barack Obama that they want to treat him differently than almost any other President who has served at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I am trying to figure it out. What is it about Barack Obama that he has to be treated with such disrespect? The amazing thing to me is that they have actually failed to stop this President. They gave him no assistance as it relates to trying to turn the economy around. He inherited a train wreck from George W. Bush and has gotten the economy back on track. Not a single Member from the other side of the aisle voted for the stimulus package, which was necessary to stabilize the economy and then build it up. There was 71 consecutive months of private sector job creation, and 14 million-plus private sector jobs were created under this Presidency. The unemployment rate has gone from over 10 percent to under 5 percent. The stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. The deficit has been reduced by more than $1 trillion. Gas prices are below $2 per gallon. More than 18 million previously uninsured Americans now have health coverage. Not a single one of those accomplishments occurred with a vote from the other side of the aisle. What is it about this President that they don't like? Now, in his final term--and, by the way, speaking to strict constructionists--when you look at the United States Constitution, I can't find a 3-year term. I can't find it. It is a 4-year term with 325 days left. All we are asking is that they just do their job. It is pretty simple. Give whoever the President puts forth a fair hearing. They have the votes to defeat any of his nominees. Let me ask my colleague from Ohio. What I haven't been able to understand is this Justice who I have disagreed with on many issues. Although he was strong--Justice Scalia--on the privacy rights of the American people, the Fourth Amendment--was concerned about the criminalization of politics, these are areas where there is some common ground. And certainly he was a giant in terms of legal thought. The news of his demise was barely out for public consumption when Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying: We are not considering anyone that President Obama puts forth. How do you explain that? How do you interpret that reaction? We couldn't even respect the death of Justice Scalia before the vacancy was politicized, before he was even buried and funeralized. Mrs. BEATTY. Congressman Jeffries, I think you answered that question for me when you gave the long list of successes that this President has done without their help. That gave me pause to think: What is it that is keeping them from doing their job? Why is it that they are so threatened? Maybe it is the success that this President has brought forth not for you and I, not for the 435 Members of us, but he has done this for this Nation. He has made it a better place. When we look at what the Justices do and represent, when we think about liberties and freedoms and the economy and our rights, I think they are afraid that he will appoint someone who will have that same scholarship, who will have that same success, someone who will bring balance. I think they are afraid of the balance. In the words of another one of our colleagues, I might add, from the great State of Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus--she has words that she is entering, but I would like to quote from her words to remind us why we are saying: Senate Republicans, do your job. She reminds us, as Members of Congress, we made a promise to our constituents that we would faithfully discharge the duties and the oath of office which we took, which we were elected to. She reminded me in her words that it is so important for us to say tonight to the Senate: Do your job. Do your job. I think they are afraid. So I am going to issue a challenge. Congresswoman Barbara Lee said that you are here tonight initiating this topic because we are sounding the alarm, we are ringing the bell. I challenge them to answer that question. I challenge them to share with not only the Congressional Black Caucus, not only the Members of Congress, not only the Members of the Senate, but they have an obligation to America, to the citizens of these United States, Mr. Speaker, for them to tell us why they are not doing their job. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for those very powerful words. I can only hope, as we close this Special Order hour, that our colleagues from across this Capitol will see fit simply to adhere to their constitutional responsibilities to consider any nominee put forth by President Obama comprehensively and fairly and to faithfully execute those obligations consistent with their oath of office, not for the good of this President, not for the good of this Article I Congress, but for the good of the United States of America. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1037-H1043] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1915 SUPREME COURT VACANCY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to once again stand on the floor of the House of Representatives along with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, coanchor of this CBC Special Order hour, this hour of power where, for the next 60 minutes, we will have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about an issue of grave importance to the integrity of our democracy, and that is making sure that the United States Senate fulfills their constitutional obligation to advise and consent as it relates to considering any Supreme Court nomination that President Obama sends up to that body. We know that Justice Antonin Scalia has moved on after a long and distinguished career. Though I disagree with almost every single judicial opinion that he has issued, he served this Nation well. Now that he has moved on, the Supreme Court, which is contained in Article III of the United States Constitution, has a vacancy. It is the obligation of the United States Senate to fill that vacancy by considering whatever nominee President Barack Obama sends forward. Members of the United States Senate take an oath of office to faithfully discharge their responsibilities. When you look at Article II, section 2, of the United States Constitution, which gives the President the power to nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, it is the Senate that must consider that nominee. Since the early part of the 20th century, there have been eight different Supreme Court nominees who have been voted on in an election year. Six of them actually were confirmed, but all eight of them received a hearing. So, for the life of me, I can't figure out why Senator Mitch McConnell thinks that he can get away with holding a nomination up without even the slightest bit of consideration. So we are going to explore that here today. We will be joined by any number of distinguished Members of the House of Representatives and the Congressional Black Caucus, but let me proceed by yielding to my good friend and colleague from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my dynamic coanchor who does such a tremendous job on behalf of the people of the great State of Ohio and the city of Columbus. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries. It is certainly an honor and a privilege for me to join you this evening as coanchor for this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. Congressman Jeffries' scholarship and distinguished talents as a member of the Judiciary Committee have not gone unnoticed. I thank him for leading by example in challenging us to initiate and follow through in sending a message on Senate Republicans' refusal to act on the Supreme Court vacancy. In part, tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Senate Republicans: Do Your Job, does just that. As you reflected in your opening statement, Article II, section 2, of the Constitution expressly designates that the President has a duty to name and the Senate has a responsibility to advise and consent a nominee to fill the seat. President Obama takes this very seriously. He has stated: ``It's a decision to which I devote considerable time, deep reflection, careful deliberation, and serious consultation with legal experts, members of both political parties, and people across the political spectrum.'' But Republicans have made a decision to completely refuse consideration of anyone that President Obama nominates to the Supreme Court. In fact, they have stated that they won't hold a hearing or a vote before the full Senate. Senate Democrats never acted so recklessly when faced with this situation in 1988, when there was a vote to confirm Justice Kennedy. There was no talk of doing nothing until after that year's election because it was unthinkable then to leave the Court shorthanded for that long. And it remains so now. The power of the Court, Mr. Speaker, is reflected in the work it does. Its decisions often shape the policy as profoundly as any law passed by Congress or any action taken by the President of these United States. When we look back to our history, especially as African Americans, the importance of the decisions handed down by the Supreme Court cannot be overstated. For example, most of us are familiar with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which reversed Plessy v. Ferguson and its ``separate but equal'' ruling. Striking down segregation in our Nation's public schools provided a major catalyst for the civil rights movement and made advances in desegregating housing, public accommodations, and institutions of higher education possible. After Brown, the Nation made some great strides towards opening the doors of education to all students. Unfortunately, the promise of the Brown decision remains unfulfilled in many ways. More than 2 million Black students attend schools where 90 percent of the student body is made up of minority students. On average, schools serving more minority populations have less experienced, lower paid teachers who are less likely to be certified. A report from the Center for American Progress found that a 10 percent point increase in students of color at a school is associated with a decrease in per-pupil spending of $75. In many ways, more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education school systems in the United States are still separate and unequal. And we are just not witnessing educational disparities at the elementary and secondary education level. College enrollment is racially polarized. White students are overrepresented in selective colleges, which have more resources to educate and to support them, while African American students are overrepresented in less selective institutions. Mr. Speaker and Congressman Jeffries, you see where I am going with that. [[Page H1038]] This is also why the late Justice Scalia's comments during oral arguments of the pending United States Supreme Court case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, were so disturbing. He stated, in part: Maybe the University of Texas ought to have fewer African Americans. These comments are inaccurate and insulting to me and to African Americans. They undervalue the historic achievement that African Americans have made. Thousands of Black Americans have excelled to the top tier of their universities. Many of them you will hear from tonight because they are members of the Congressional Black Caucus. They are scholars. They are the conscience of the Congress. They represent the diversity of America's best universities and of America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her wonderful thoughts and observations, and I look forward to our continued dialogue. It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), one of those individuals that Representative Beatty mentioned who is really a legal giant amongst us. He is someone who has served this institution well. He understands the Constitution, the notion of separation of powers, and the importance of a fair and equitable justice system. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing tonight's Special Order to call on our colleagues in the Senate to do their job and provide their advice and consent on the President's upcoming nomination to the United States Supreme Court. The Constitution is pretty clear on this issue. Article II, Section 2, doesn't say the President might or the President should. It says the President shall nominate, and by and with advice and consent of the Senate, appoint judges to the Supreme Court. There seems to be some suggestion that, if it is an election year, he ought to skip that process and let the next President make the appointment. They say there is very little precedence for a President nominating somebody in an election year. That might be technically correct, but the fact of the matter is that there have been virtually no vacancies that have occurred during an election year. I think the last one was about almost 50 years. In that case, an appointment was made and considered. That is the process that ought to take place in this case. The rarity of such an event should not preclude the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. There is precedent for the President nominating and the Senate at least considering the nomination during an election year. Now, Justice Kennedy was confirmed in an election year in 1988. That was a 7-month process that began with the appointment of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. His nomination was considered and defeated. And then there was the appointment of Douglas Ginsburg. We will just say his nomination went up in smoke. And then we had the nomination and confirmation of Justice Kennedy. In 7 months, from start to finish, another nomination was made and collapsed and another nomination made, all within 7 months. We could complete that entire process by the first Monday in October, the beginning of the Supreme Court session. There is no precedence for the President declining to nominate somebody and virtually no precedence for the Senate just to ignore a nomination that is made. The people overwhelmingly reelected President Obama in 2012 to a term that does not end until January 20, 2017, and we fully expect the President to fulfill his duty to nominate a qualified individual to the Supreme Court to fill the current vacancy. A failure of the Senate to act this year would be unprecedented. There is ample time for that to take place. The longest confirmation process for a single nominee has been 125 days. On historic average, it takes 25 days to confirm or reject a nominee. As of today, the Senate has 216 days until the first Monday in October. If the Senate were to refuse to consider any of President Obama's nominations--and they have said they want the next President to make the appointment--there has been no indication that they will give expedited consideration to the next President's nomination. It could be well into the next year by the time the new Justice is confirmed and sworn in. Even on an expedited schedule, the new President would not be able to nominate anyone until they are sworn in on January 20. The Senate Judiciary Committee would need time to prepare for hearings, which could not occur until probably February. And then the full Senate would need time to consider the nomination, with the confirmation not likely until probably March. {time} 1930 Now, by March of a term, the term is effectively about over. Most of the oral arguments have already taken place and they are into decisions. You can't participate in a decision if you skip the oral argument. So not only would the vacancy occur through the rest of this term, almost half of a Supreme Court term, it would be well into the next term and, effectively, through most of the next term. There is no excuse to leave the Court vacancy open in what then would be a historic new precedence. There is no precedence for keeping a vacancy open that long. We need the justice appointed. The Senate ought to do its job. The President has indicated that he will do his job, as mandated by the Constitution, and so the Senate ought to just fulfill its responsibility under the Constitution and consider an appointment. Otherwise, you will have a vacancy not only through the rest of this term--and oral arguments have been taking place--you will have the vacancy through the rest of this term. You don't need a vacancy through the entire rest of the next term. There is plenty of time to consider and vote up or down on a nomination. And the unprecedented vacancy that would occur if the Senate fulfills its threat to stonewall any nomination is just unprecedented. So I want to thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for giving us the opportunity to just say a word about the importance of everyone in our democracy fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. The President shall appoint, and the Senate shall consider, advise and consent, so that we can have a Supreme Court Justice appointed before the first Monday in October. We have plenty of time to do that. There is no excuse for not doing it, and we expect the Senate to do its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia for highlighting several important points, including the fact that there is no election year exception in Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. This is all in Mitch McConnell's mind, cooked up in some partisan laboratory in order to stop this President from being able to move forward and do the business of the American people. We shouldn't be surprised, because we know Mitch McConnell stated very early on that his objective was to grind everything to a halt here in the Capitol to try to prevent President Obama from being re-elected. Not my words, his words. But here's the thing. President Obama was re-elected in an electoral college landslide. And his opponent in that race, Mitt Romney, tried to make it, in part, an election that was a referendum on the possibility that President Obama would have the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. That issue was laid before the American people by President Obama's opponent, and the American people responded, processed all of the facts, and decided to re-elect President Obama, send him back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The American people did their job. The President is prepared to do his job. The Senate Republicans need to do their job as well. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to someone who has been a stalwart for justice in this institution, a revered Member of the House of Representatives, the great whip of House Democrats, and someone who has the respect of everyone in the United [[Page H1039]] States Capitol and beyond for his service to the House and his service to the country, a great friend to the Congressional Black Caucus, and we are so thankful that he is present here today. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York (Mr. Jeffries) for his excellent presentation. I want to thank Mr. Scott, who, as the gentleman observed, is one of the leaders in this Congress on the Constitution and on the law and on equal justice. I want to thank my friend from Ohio, the gentlewoman from Ohio, for her remarks. I noticed that the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, formerly a judge on the Court in North Carolina, is here. Mr. Speaker, I want to first say that I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for sponsoring this Special Order. I want to tell every Member, and all Americans ought to know, this is not an issue related to one group, to one gender, to one race, to one nationality. The failure to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court will affect every American. So we rise tonight to ask the Senate to do its duty. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here on the floor this evening with my distinguished colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order. The Supreme Court now has a vacancy, as everyone knows, that must be filled. The American people deserve a Supreme Court operating at full strength. Mr. Speaker, I am old enough to have been alive at the time that John Kennedy was assassinated. Within hours of his death, we swore in Lyndon Johnson as President of the United States because we wanted to make sure that there was a continuity of service. As sad and as tragic as those hours were, the responsibility of having a President of the United States was met within just a few hours. Mr. Speaker, when a vacancy occurs in this House--and there are, after all, 434 of us left when that happens--the State laws put a time limit on the Governors' action to call an election so that that vacancy can be filled. Why? Because the Constitution of those States do not want to have a vacancy exist for very long and have their State or their district not represented. Now, there is not a time limit with respect to the Supreme Court, per se. And the reason for that, of course, is the process, as Mr. Scott just pointed out, sometimes take a little longer, sometimes takes a little shorter. But in 7 months, as the gentleman pointed out, they had three nominees considered. Two were defeated after debate and a vote, and the third was confirmed. The process worked, and it worked in the last year of an administration. President Obama has a constitutional responsibility to nominate a candidate for the Court that will exercise sound judgment, uphold the principle that all people are created equal and must be treated equally under the laws. The Founders of our country very wisely made the number on the Supreme Court an odd number, not an even number, because the Founders did not want gridlock. Now we are used to gridlock in this Congress. But they did not want gridlock on the Court, and so they provided for a decision to be made by five members out of nine. Now, however, with four and four, they will maybe not be able to make a decision. That was not contemplated by the Founders, nor would it have been welcomed by the Founders. Shamefully, Senate Republicans have said they have no intention of even meeting with a nominee put forward by President Obama. That is not only disrespectful of the President of the United States, Barack Obama, but it is contrary to the best interest of the Supreme Court, but more importantly, to the people of this country. It is appalling that Republicans would prefer to leave a vacancy on the Supreme Court, thereby rendering it in some cases unable to make a decision, unable to perform its duties of being the final arbiter when circuits may differ on an issue. If Members of one party or another were simply to ignore the other side and refuse to carry out their duties within a divided government, our democracy would break down, and in some respects it has. We ought not to carry that conduct to the Supreme Court. We must not let that happen and we must not allow this Supreme Court vacancy to remain unfilled. The Court currently has a number, as the gentleman from New York has pointed out, of major cases pending that require a decision; not to be remanded to a lower court, because if that is done, that judgment may stand for that circuit, but there will be other circuits around the country who may make a different decision. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court has been a powerful safeguard of American's liberty and equality over the past century and beyond. From recognizing the right of every child to attend desegregated schools, to protecting every loving couple who wishes to marry, the Court has breathed life into the words of our Declaration of Independence that all are ``created equal, and they are endowed by their Creator,'' not by us, not by the Constitution, ``by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.'' That may be self-evident, Mr. Speaker, but it is not self-executed. And we have established the Supreme Court of the United States to make a decision so that that can be realized. Melissa Hart, Director of the Byron White Center, a former member of the Supreme Court for Constitutional Law at the University of Denver said, if we don't act, ``It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve legal questions.'' Caroline Frederickson, president of the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy, wrote on February 19, ``It would be unfathomable to go through this term,'' and as Mr. Scott pointed out, the next term, ``with a Supreme Court hobbled by a vacancy.'' Mr. Speaker, let me remind you again, if a President dies, immediately we fill the vacancy. If a Member of Congress dies, every State has a time limit in which that must be filled so that democracy can be represented and operate in the way our Founders wanted it to operate. When the President nominates a candidate to the Court, the Senate, in my view, Mr. Speaker, has a responsibility under the Constitution to give that nominee every due consideration. They do not have a constitutional responsibility to approve it, as Mr. Scott has pointed out, but they have a responsibility to consider it. We must not allow politics, we must not allow politics, we must not allow politics to allow the obstruction of this most essential institution of our democracy and the rule of law. I want to thank my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for leading this Special Order and for their efforts to hold Senate Republicans accountable for their blatantly irresponsible action on this matter. Mr. Speaker, there is always another election. It may be 2 years away, it may be 4 years away, but if we adopt the principle that if we don't think we can win now, we will obstruct now and hope to win later, America and Americans will not be well-served. I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Democratic whip for a very insightful and powerful observation, for pointing that the very fabric of the United States Constitution is threatened by the willingness of Senate Republicans to abdicate their legislative responsibilities to hold hearings and act on a nomination put forth by the President of the United States of America. {time} 1945 It is now my great honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, as was pointed out by Mr. Hoyer, a former prominent member of the North Carolina judiciary, a legal scholar, a historian, and, of course, the leader of the conscience of the Congress here in the United States House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the chairman, G.K. Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me begin tonight by thanking the gentleman, Mr. Jeffries, for yielding to [[Page H1040]] me this evening and to thank him for his extraordinary friendship and leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. I want to publicly thank you for coming to my district this past weekend. You spoke--some would say you preached--at Mount Vernon Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina, and I thank you so very much for the message that you brought to my constituents in North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, moments after the death of Justice Scalia, the majority leader of the United States Senate announced to the country in a tone of defiance that the Senate will not consider any nomination--any nomination--of President Barack Obama to replace Justice Scalia. Mr. Speaker, the American people can see right through this. Though I represent a Democratic-leaning district in North Carolina, I represent many Republicans in North Carolina. Many of them have told me how disappointed they are with the Senate Republican leadership in making this announcement. Senator McConnell is reinforcing the Republican political agenda to disrupt--to disrupt--governmental functions when the circumstances do not line up with their conservative philosophy. It is imperative that we have nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court deciding constitutional issues that are important to the American people. The irony in all of this is that my Republican friends constantly on this floor talk about strict construction of the Constitution. A strict construction of the Constitution, as Mr. Hoyer said a moment ago, requires the President to nominate an individual once there is a vacancy on the Court. The Senate, the United States Senate, has the awesome responsibility of having a hearing, deciding, and confirming the nomination by an up-or-down vote. So it is absurd to suggest that President Obama should be denied the opportunity to nominate a qualified Justice to replace Justice Scalia. The American people should clearly understand that Senate Republicans have a political agenda to pack the Court with conservative Justices who would reverse years of commonsense progressive jurisprudence. So the Congressional Black Caucus tonight demands Senate Republicans to stop the complete blockade and the blatant disrespect of our President. Senate Republicans' outright refusal to hold a hearing on any individual nominated by the President to serve on the Court is an affront to our Constitution and the American people. Such divisive actions undermine our democracy and reduce our standing in the world. This blockade is an obstruction and runs afoul of the duties held by those who hold a seat in the august Chamber of the United States Senate. I have read that Senator Grassley, Senator McConnell, and others will meet with President Obama this week. I hope they meet. I hope they sit together and reconcile their differences because this issue needs to be put to rest. We call on Senate Republicans to hold hearings once President Obama submits his nomination and follow the procedures set forth in the Constitution. In short and in closing, the Congressional Black Caucus, the 45, 46 members of the Congressional Black Caucus--and, indeed, the American people--have one message--one message--for Senate Republicans: Do your job. Don't play partisanship. Don't play a partisan game with the Supreme Court of the United States of America. It is too serious. It is too important. Thank you very much, Mr. Jeffries. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished chair for pointing out that this is a simple question for Senate Republicans: Do your job consistent with your obligations and responsibilities under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. The Senate Republicans' failure to act or consider any nominee put forth by the President of the United States of America is an abdication of responsibility, a dereliction of duty, and it would be a stunning act of legislative malpractice that undermines the rule of law, the Presidency, the Supreme Court, the United States Constitution, as well as the American people. I am thankful now to be joined by someone who is a powerful voice for the voiceless here in the House of Representatives, who has ably served her constituents in northern California and consistently fought for a fair, equitable society. Let me now yield to my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from California, Representative Barbara Lee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from New York for yielding, but also for his tremendous leadership. You and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty from Ohio really have sounded the alarm, beat the drum, and really brought to the American people the important issues that we are dealing with each and every day, so I just have to thank you for your diligence and for staying the course. Every week you are here, you are representing not only this Congress, but the country very, very well. So thank you. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with all my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus, with our whip, Mr. Hoyer, and others to urge our Republican colleagues in the Senate to, of course, do your job. Also, let me just remind us, once again, the President is trying to meet his constitutional obligation once again. He is trying to do what he is supposed to do, and that is to nominate Justice Scalia's replacement to our Nation's highest Court. And Senate Republicans have a constitutional responsibility to give the President's nominee a speedy and fair hearing, followed up with a simple up-or-down vote. Sadly, these Senate Republicans said ``no'' to their constitutional responsibility. The Supreme Court has a huge responsibility of deciding cases that impact every aspect of American life, from our elections, college admissions, to scientific patents and a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions. It is imperative that the Supreme Court be allowed to function in its full capacity with nine Justices. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was appointed by a conservative President, President Ronald Reagan, did not mince words in her condemnation of Republicans playing politics with the Court. She said: ``We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it.'' Former Justice O'Connor, I could not agree more. Despite the calls for action and a constitutional mandate, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said that there will be no hearings, no votes, not even a meeting with President Obama to discuss the late Justice Scalia's replacement. That is just wrong. His actions prompted The New York Times to editorialize that he ``seems to have lost touch with reality and the Constitution,'' speaking of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a couple of New York Times articles. [From the New York Times, Feb. 17, 2016] Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor (By Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin) Charleston, SC.--As he left Martha Lou's Kitchen, a soul food institution here on Wednesday, Edward Gadsden expressed irritation about the Republican determination to block President Obama from selecting Justice Antonin Scalia's replacement on the Supreme Court. ``They've been fighting that man since he's been there,'' Mr. Gadsden, who is African-American, said of Mr. Obama, before pointing at his forearm to explain what he said was driving the Republican opposition: ``The color of his skin, that's all, the color of his skin.'' When Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after Mr. Scalia's death on Saturday that the next president, rather than Mr. Obama, should select a successor, the senator's words struck a familiar and painful chord with many black voters. After years of watching political opponents question the president's birthplace and his faith, and hearing a member of Congress shout ``You lie!'' at him from the House floor, some African-Americans saw the move by Senate Republicans as another attempt to deny the legitimacy of the country's first black president. And they call it increasingly infuriating after Mr. Obama has spent seven years in the White House and won two resounding election victories. ``Our president, the president of the United States, has been disrespected from Day 1,'' Carol Richardson, 61, said on Wednesday as she colored a customer's hair at Ultra Beauty Saloh in Hollywood, S.C., a mostly black town near Charleston. ``The words that have been said, the things the Republicans have done they'd have never have done to another president. Let's talk like it is, it's because of his skin color.'' [[Page H1041]] Reflecting on the Supreme Court vacancy, Bakari Sellers, a former state representative from Denmark, S.C., likened the Senate treatment of the president to the 18th century constitutional compromise that counted black men as equivalent to three-fifths of a person. ``I guess many of them are using this in the strictest construction that Barack Obama's serving three-fifths of a term or he's three-fifths of a human being, so he doesn't get to make this choice,'' Mr. Sellers said. ``It's infuriating.'' The anger and outrage that Mr. McConnell's position has touched off among African-Americans could have implications for the presidential election. Leading African-American Democrats are trying to use it to motivate rank-and-file blacks to vote in November, the first presidential election in a decade in which Mr. Obama will not be on the ballot and in which Democrats fear black participation could drop. ``Anger becomes action when it's directly tied to a moment, and the moment now is the election on Nov. 8,'' said Stacey Abrams, a Democratic state representative from Georgia and the House minority leader there, adding that Mr. Scalia's death meant that this presidential campaign could no longer be construed as a mere ``thought exercise.'' For Hillary Clinton, who is increasingly relying on nonwhite voters to ensure her success against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the court issue could be especially crucial. Should she defeat Mr. Sanders, who has electrified many liberals, she will need a motivating issue to bring Mr. Obama's loyalists to the polls. She moved swiftly Tuesday to tap into the anger of blacks over the opposition of Senate Republicans to Mr. Obama's naming a replacement for Justice Scalia. ``Now the Republicans say they'll reject anyone President Obama nominates no matter how qualified,'' Mrs. Clinton said in remarks before a predominantly black audience in Harlem. ``Some are even saying he doesn't have the right to nominate anyone! As if somehow he's not the real president.'' Doing so, Mrs. Clinton added, is in keeping with a longstanding pattern of mistreatment. ``They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe,'' she said. ``This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.'' Republicans are especially sensitive about the notion that they are diminishing Mr. Obama because of his race, and spokesmen for several Republican senators, including Mr. McConnell and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, declined to comment or would not make the senators available for comment. The suggestion that racism is playing a role angers Mr. McConnell's friends, who point out that his formative political experience was working for a Republican senator who supported civil rights, that he helped override President Ronald Reagan's veto of sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa and that he is married to an Asian-American woman. But in the aftermath of Mr. McConnell's statement on Saturday, a growing chorus of black voices is complaining that such a refusal to even consider a Supreme Court nominee would never occur with a white president. ``It's more than a political motive--it has a smell of racism,'' said Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``I can tick instance after instance over the last seven years where Republicans have purposely tried to diminish the president's authority,'' Mr. Butterfield said. ``This is just really extreme, and leads me to the conclusion that if this was any other president who was not African-American, it would not have been handled this way.'' Even as Mr. Obama's popularity has risen and fallen, his base of support among black voters has been unshakable. A Gallup tracking poll this month showed that some 85 percent of African-Americans approved of the president's performance compared with only 36 percent of whites. And many African- Americans strongly identify personally with Mr. Obama, and have watched his tenure with pride. Mr. Butterfield said that he believed that the effort to undermine, and even delegitimize, Mr. Obama began soon after he was sworn in, and that Congressional Republicans had blocked Mr. Obama's agenda wherever they could. Even more stinging were the suggestions from some on the right that Mr. Obama, a Christian, is actually a Muslim and that he was not born in the United States. In interviews, members of the Congressional Black Caucus also bitterly recounted indignities, such as demands--most pointedly from the current Republican front-runner in the polls, Donald J. Trump, in 2011--that Mr. Obama prove he was born in Hawaii, and not in Kenya, as some critics claimed. Others recalled the calls to impeach Mr. Obama over his use of executive authority. ``You hear the thing about: `He's not a citizen. He oversteps his bounds. He's divisive.' One thing after another,'' said Representative Marcia L. Fudge, Democrat of Ohio. ``This has been going on since the day he was elected in 2008.'' Republicans have had more success than Democrats in recent decades galvanizing their voters over who should control the courts. But Jennifer McClellan, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Democratic National Committee, said the dispute over how to replace Justice Scalia could now become ``an issue for the average citizen.'' Ms. Abrams agreed, saying the Supreme Court and its powerful influence on people's lives is especially resonant with blacks. ``Congress is denying our president his rights as a president, but, more than that, they're denying the legacy of his presidency,'' she said. ``That will animate Democratic voters across the board but especially African- Americans, who realize more than many voters how great an impact the Supreme Court can have on freedom.'' ____ [From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 2016] Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat (By the Editorial Board) Following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Republicans apparently believe they can profit by creating a political crisis that the nation has never seen before. On Tuesday, the leadership doubled down on its refusal to take any action on any nominee from President Obama to replace Justice Scalia. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader who seems to have lost touch with reality and the Constitution, accused Mr. Obama of plunging the nation into a ``bitter and avoidable struggle'' should he name anyone to the court. Forget an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Top Republicans are pledging not to hold hearings or even to meet with a nominee. In a statement dripping with sarcasm, Mr. McConnell said that Mr. Obama ``has every right to nominate someone,'' and ``even if doing so will inevitably plunge our nation into another bitter and avoidable struggle, that is his right. Even if he never expects that nominee to actually be confirmed but rather to wield as an electoral cudgel, that is his right.'' Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, said, ``We believe the American people need to decide who is going to make this appointment rather than a lame-duck president.'' These statements are so twisted that it's hard to know where to begin. Let's take them one by one. First, Mr. Obama is not a ``lame-duck president.'' The lame-duck period is broadly understood to run from after the November election until a new president is inaugurated in January. November is more than eight months off. Based on the average number of days it has taken the Senate to act on previous Supreme Court nominees, the seat could be filled by this spring. Second, no matter how often Republicans repeat the phrase ``let the people decide,'' that's not how the system works. The Constitution vests the power to make nominations to the court in the president, not ``the people.'' In any case, the people have already decided who should make this appointment: They elected Mr. Obama twice, by large margins. Third, it is preposterous to accuse Mr. Obama of causing a ``bitter struggle'' by nominating someone who will not be confirmed. The only reason a nominee would not be confirmed is that the Senate has pre-emptively decided to block any nominee sight unseen. Mr. Obama is once again the only adult in the room, carrying out his constitutional obligation while Senate Republicans scramble to dig up examples of Democrats trying to block nominees. But those examples show only that Democratic senators have pushed hard for Republican presidents to pick ideologically moderate nominees. Until now, neither party has ever vowed to shut down the nomination process entirely, even before it has begun. Only two Republican senators, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine, were brave enough to say that they would vote on President Obama's nominee. This is what passes for moderation in today's G.O.P.: simply stating a willingness to do the job you were elected to do. Unfortunately, for too many Republicans moderation now equals apostasy. These Republicans have stubbornly parked themselves so far to the right for so many years that it is hard to tell whether they can hear how deranged they sound. The truth is they are afraid--and they should be. They know Mr. Obama has a large pool of extremely smart and thoroughly mainstream candidates from which to choose a nominee. They know that if the American people were allowed to hear such a person answer questions in a Senate hearing, they would wonder what all the fuss was about. So Mr. McConnell and his colleagues plan to shut their doors, plug their ears and hope the public doesn't notice. The Republican spin machine is working overtime to rationalize this behavior. Don't be fooled. It is panic masquerading as strength. Ms. LEE. One of the titles of these articles is ``Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor.'' The other is The New York Times article, ``Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat.'' Likewise, Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley of Iowa led a letter to the majority leader signed by all the Republican Committee members confirming their resolve to not have hearings or a vote on the nominee. [[Page H1042]] This is downright ludicrous. Republicans cannot and should not use the Supreme Court to push their radical political agenda. The Constitution is clear, Mr. Speaker. Article II, section 2, ``He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . . . shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court.'' Nowhere in the Constitution does it say, ``except in an election year'' or ``except when the President is a Democrat'' or ``when Republicans have spent the last 7 years actively working to subvert every policy proposed by a President elected by nearly 70 million Americans.'' The Constitution doesn't say that. This is simply unacceptable, and the American people deserve better. For more than a century, every single Supreme Court nominee has received a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Just like all the Presidents before him, President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice, and the Senate should determine if he or she is fit to serve on this Nation's High Court. Instead, Republicans are holding the Supreme Court and the American people hostage. Their action, in the words of The New York Times, is simply, ``panic masquerading as strength.'' The Senate has a responsibility to at least consider the President's Supreme Court nominee, and by refusing to do so, they are failing their constituents and their Nation. So, Mr. Speaker, it is really past time for Majority Leader McConnell and the rest of the Republican leadership to do their jobs and work together to get a new Supreme Court Justice. The Supreme Court is way too important to be used as a political bargaining chip. Enough is enough. So, once again, I join my colleagues, Congressman Jeffries, Congresswoman Beatty, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and the American people in saying, ``Do your job.'' Once again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join with you tonight. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California for making several important points as it relates to the absence of any partisanship exception in the United States Constitution, the absence of any exception whereby the Senate will do its job unless, of course, President Barack Obama happens to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I see that nowhere within the four corners of the United States Constitution. I don't see an election year exception in the United States Constitution. So I am perplexed as to what is the situation we find ourselves in right now. I thought that I may ask the distinguished gentlewoman, my colleague, my coanchor from Ohio, to reflect upon, if you might, a few comments that could shed light on the situation we find ourselves in right now as it relates to the Supreme Court vacancy made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over the years during his time here in Congress. In 1986, Mitch McConnell said: ``I believe that a heavy burden must be met by those who would have this nominee rejected. Under the Constitution, our duty is to provide advice and consent to judicial nominations, not to substitute our judgment for what are reasonable views for a judicial nominee to hold.'' That was in 1986. Then in 1990, he said: ``It is clear under our form of government that the advice and consent role of the Senate in judicial nominations should not be politicized.'' That was Mitch McConnell in 1990. In 2005, he said: ``Our job is to react to that nomination in a respectful and dignified way, and at the end of the process, to give that person an up-or-down vote as all nominees who have majority support have gotten throughout the history of the country.'' I am trying to figure out what has changed, Representative Beatty. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries. Hearing you quote those things, three things come to mind. First, let me say that Congressman Steny Hoyer was absolutely right when he says that this issue of not filling the vacancy is not related to only one group. So I want to say, after hearing what you said and many others of our members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is important for us to know why we are calling on the Senate Republicans to do their job, and that is because we are the voice for those who are not often represented. We are the voice for those when you talk about issues related to women and women's rights, when you talk about issues that are related to things that affect you and me, and when you talk about the article that Congresswoman Barbara Lee entered into the Record, ``Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor.'' Now, that article says it all. That article specifically states that many folks believe, in this wonderful America that we live in, that it is also because of the color of his skin. I think that is another reason that we come as a strong 46 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, because the facts work against them. Think about it. When we look at the number of people who have been appointed, when we look at the number of days, if you look at since 1975, it has only taken an average of 67 days to confirm a President's nominee to the Supreme Court. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, and there are 325 days left in President Obama's term. {time} 2000 Since the early 1900s, six Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in an election year. When I think about your question and I think about your sharing with us some of the comments that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said, let me add this one to the Record. And it is something he got right. He said that the American people should have the right to choose the President who will pick the next Supreme Court Justice deciding the future balance of the Nation's highest court. Well, he got that right. Because you know what. The people did pick the President when they picked President Barack Obama in 2012, who won the election by 5 million votes. I am calling on him and the Senate Republicans to do their job, to allow the President to do what the Constitution tells us, to allow the President, who has already said that he is going to bring somebody who is full of scholarship, he is going to bring someone who is committed and capable to doing the people's work--I wanted to add that to your statement and share with everyone tonight that is why we are here. Mr. JEFFRIES. I really appreciate that. As we are simply trying to point out, all we are asking for is for the Senate to adhere to its constitutional responsibilities and, when the President sends forth a nominee, to conduct a rigorous hearing process before the American people and then, at the end of that process, provide that nominee with an up-or-down vote before the Judiciary Committee and then, ultimately, the floor of the United States Senate. Now, I have been in this institution for a little over 3 years. If I had a dollar for every time some of my colleagues mentioned strict adherence to the United States Constitution, I would be a billionaire right now. For the life of me, I can't understand what is so complicated about this particular issue. As Representative Beatty so ably pointed out, from this moment, there are 325 days remaining in the Presidency of Barack Obama. As this chart illustrates, if you just take a look at the current occupants of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice, the most important position on the Supreme Court, a 23-day confirmation process; Justice Scalia, confirmed in 85 days; Justice Kagan, 87 days; Justice Sotomayor, 66 days; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a/k/a the notorious RBG--one of my personal favorites--50 days; Justice Clarence Thomas, 99 days. You can add some of these confirmation periods together and you still wouldn't get to 325. So what is the problem? Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining on my Special Order today? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 12 minutes remaining. [[Page H1043]] General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, one of the concerns that I think we in the Congressional Black Caucus have as it relates to the Presidency of President Obama--and Representative Beatty pointed this out--is that there is a feeling in many corners of America that this President is treated differently. I am not sure if it is because there are some people here in the Capitol who have something against folks from Hawaii. I am not sure if it is his Kansas roots. I don't know if they dislike the fact that he was a community organizer in terms of one of the jobs that he held after school. I don't know if they dislike the fact that he is so well educated from Columbia and Harvard Law Schools. I don't know if it is the fact that he was the President of the Harvard Law Review or a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, one of the top five law schools in this country. I don't really know what it is about Barack Obama that they want to treat him differently than almost any other President who has served at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I am trying to figure it out. What is it about Barack Obama that he has to be treated with such disrespect? The amazing thing to me is that they have actually failed to stop this President. They gave him no assistance as it relates to trying to turn the economy around. He inherited a train wreck from George W. Bush and has gotten the economy back on track. Not a single Member from the other side of the aisle voted for the stimulus package, which was necessary to stabilize the economy and then build it up. There was 71 consecutive months of private sector job creation, and 14 million-plus private sector jobs were created under this Presidency. The unemployment rate has gone from over 10 percent to under 5 percent. The stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. The deficit has been reduced by more than $1 trillion. Gas prices are below $2 per gallon. More than 18 million previously uninsured Americans now have health coverage. Not a single one of those accomplishments occurred with a vote from the other side of the aisle. What is it about this President that they don't like? Now, in his final term--and, by the way, speaking to strict constructionists--when you look at the United States Constitution, I can't find a 3-year term. I can't find it. It is a 4-year term with 325 days left. All we are asking is that they just do their job. It is pretty simple. Give whoever the President puts forth a fair hearing. They have the votes to defeat any of his nominees. Let me ask my colleague from Ohio. What I haven't been able to understand is this Justice who I have disagreed with on many issues. Although he was strong--Justice Scalia--on the privacy rights of the American people, the Fourth Amendment--was concerned about the criminalization of politics, these are areas where there is some common ground. And certainly he was a giant in terms of legal thought. The news of his demise was barely out for public consumption when Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying: We are not considering anyone that President Obama puts forth. How do you explain that? How do you interpret that reaction? We couldn't even respect the death of Justice Scalia before the vacancy was politicized, before he was even buried and funeralized. Mrs. BEATTY. Congressman Jeffries, I think you answered that question for me when you gave the long list of successes that this President has done without their help. That gave me pause to think: What is it that is keeping them from doing their job? Why is it that they are so threatened? Maybe it is the success that this President has brought forth not for you and I, not for the 435 Members of us, but he has done this for this Nation. He has made it a better place. When we look at what the Justices do and represent, when we think about liberties and freedoms and the economy and our rights, I think they are afraid that he will appoint someone who will have that same scholarship, who will have that same success, someone who will bring balance. I think they are afraid of the balance. In the words of another one of our colleagues, I might add, from the great State of Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus--she has words that she is entering, but I would like to quote from her words to remind us why we are saying: Senate Republicans, do your job. She reminds us, as Members of Congress, we made a promise to our constituents that we would faithfully discharge the duties and the oath of office which we took, which we were elected to. She reminded me in her words that it is so important for us to say tonight to the Senate: Do your job. Do your job. I think they are afraid. So I am going to issue a challenge. Congresswoman Barbara Lee said that you are here tonight initiating this topic because we are sounding the alarm, we are ringing the bell. I challenge them to answer that question. I challenge them to share with not only the Congressional Black Caucus, not only the Members of Congress, not only the Members of the Senate, but they have an obligation to America, to the citizens of these United States, Mr. Speaker, for them to tell us why they are not doing their job. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for those very powerful words. I can only hope, as we close this Special Order hour, that our colleagues from across this Capitol will see fit simply to adhere to their constitutional responsibilities to consider any nominee put forth by President Obama comprehensively and fairly and to faithfully execute those obligations consistent with their oath of office, not for the good of this President, not for the good of this Article I Congress, but for the good of the United States of America. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1037-H1043] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1915 SUPREME COURT VACANCY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to once again stand on the floor of the House of Representatives along with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, coanchor of this CBC Special Order hour, this hour of power where, for the next 60 minutes, we will have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about an issue of grave importance to the integrity of our democracy, and that is making sure that the United States Senate fulfills their constitutional obligation to advise and consent as it relates to considering any Supreme Court nomination that President Obama sends up to that body. We know that Justice Antonin Scalia has moved on after a long and distinguished career. Though I disagree with almost every single judicial opinion that he has issued, he served this Nation well. Now that he has moved on, the Supreme Court, which is contained in Article III of the United States Constitution, has a vacancy. It is the obligation of the United States Senate to fill that vacancy by considering whatever nominee President Barack Obama sends forward. Members of the United States Senate take an oath of office to faithfully discharge their responsibilities. When you look at Article II, section 2, of the United States Constitution, which gives the President the power to nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, it is the Senate that must consider that nominee. Since the early part of the 20th century, there have been eight different Supreme Court nominees who have been voted on in an election year. Six of them actually were confirmed, but all eight of them received a hearing. So, for the life of me, I can't figure out why Senator Mitch McConnell thinks that he can get away with holding a nomination up without even the slightest bit of consideration. So we are going to explore that here today. We will be joined by any number of distinguished Members of the House of Representatives and the Congressional Black Caucus, but let me proceed by yielding to my good friend and colleague from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), my dynamic coanchor who does such a tremendous job on behalf of the people of the great State of Ohio and the city of Columbus. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries. It is certainly an honor and a privilege for me to join you this evening as coanchor for this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. Congressman Jeffries' scholarship and distinguished talents as a member of the Judiciary Committee have not gone unnoticed. I thank him for leading by example in challenging us to initiate and follow through in sending a message on Senate Republicans' refusal to act on the Supreme Court vacancy. In part, tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, Senate Republicans: Do Your Job, does just that. As you reflected in your opening statement, Article II, section 2, of the Constitution expressly designates that the President has a duty to name and the Senate has a responsibility to advise and consent a nominee to fill the seat. President Obama takes this very seriously. He has stated: ``It's a decision to which I devote considerable time, deep reflection, careful deliberation, and serious consultation with legal experts, members of both political parties, and people across the political spectrum.'' But Republicans have made a decision to completely refuse consideration of anyone that President Obama nominates to the Supreme Court. In fact, they have stated that they won't hold a hearing or a vote before the full Senate. Senate Democrats never acted so recklessly when faced with this situation in 1988, when there was a vote to confirm Justice Kennedy. There was no talk of doing nothing until after that year's election because it was unthinkable then to leave the Court shorthanded for that long. And it remains so now. The power of the Court, Mr. Speaker, is reflected in the work it does. Its decisions often shape the policy as profoundly as any law passed by Congress or any action taken by the President of these United States. When we look back to our history, especially as African Americans, the importance of the decisions handed down by the Supreme Court cannot be overstated. For example, most of us are familiar with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which reversed Plessy v. Ferguson and its ``separate but equal'' ruling. Striking down segregation in our Nation's public schools provided a major catalyst for the civil rights movement and made advances in desegregating housing, public accommodations, and institutions of higher education possible. After Brown, the Nation made some great strides towards opening the doors of education to all students. Unfortunately, the promise of the Brown decision remains unfulfilled in many ways. More than 2 million Black students attend schools where 90 percent of the student body is made up of minority students. On average, schools serving more minority populations have less experienced, lower paid teachers who are less likely to be certified. A report from the Center for American Progress found that a 10 percent point increase in students of color at a school is associated with a decrease in per-pupil spending of $75. In many ways, more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education school systems in the United States are still separate and unequal. And we are just not witnessing educational disparities at the elementary and secondary education level. College enrollment is racially polarized. White students are overrepresented in selective colleges, which have more resources to educate and to support them, while African American students are overrepresented in less selective institutions. Mr. Speaker and Congressman Jeffries, you see where I am going with that. [[Page H1038]] This is also why the late Justice Scalia's comments during oral arguments of the pending United States Supreme Court case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, were so disturbing. He stated, in part: Maybe the University of Texas ought to have fewer African Americans. These comments are inaccurate and insulting to me and to African Americans. They undervalue the historic achievement that African Americans have made. Thousands of Black Americans have excelled to the top tier of their universities. Many of them you will hear from tonight because they are members of the Congressional Black Caucus. They are scholars. They are the conscience of the Congress. They represent the diversity of America's best universities and of America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her wonderful thoughts and observations, and I look forward to our continued dialogue. It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), one of those individuals that Representative Beatty mentioned who is really a legal giant amongst us. He is someone who has served this institution well. He understands the Constitution, the notion of separation of powers, and the importance of a fair and equitable justice system. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing tonight's Special Order to call on our colleagues in the Senate to do their job and provide their advice and consent on the President's upcoming nomination to the United States Supreme Court. The Constitution is pretty clear on this issue. Article II, Section 2, doesn't say the President might or the President should. It says the President shall nominate, and by and with advice and consent of the Senate, appoint judges to the Supreme Court. There seems to be some suggestion that, if it is an election year, he ought to skip that process and let the next President make the appointment. They say there is very little precedence for a President nominating somebody in an election year. That might be technically correct, but the fact of the matter is that there have been virtually no vacancies that have occurred during an election year. I think the last one was about almost 50 years. In that case, an appointment was made and considered. That is the process that ought to take place in this case. The rarity of such an event should not preclude the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. There is precedent for the President nominating and the Senate at least considering the nomination during an election year. Now, Justice Kennedy was confirmed in an election year in 1988. That was a 7-month process that began with the appointment of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. His nomination was considered and defeated. And then there was the appointment of Douglas Ginsburg. We will just say his nomination went up in smoke. And then we had the nomination and confirmation of Justice Kennedy. In 7 months, from start to finish, another nomination was made and collapsed and another nomination made, all within 7 months. We could complete that entire process by the first Monday in October, the beginning of the Supreme Court session. There is no precedence for the President declining to nominate somebody and virtually no precedence for the Senate just to ignore a nomination that is made. The people overwhelmingly reelected President Obama in 2012 to a term that does not end until January 20, 2017, and we fully expect the President to fulfill his duty to nominate a qualified individual to the Supreme Court to fill the current vacancy. A failure of the Senate to act this year would be unprecedented. There is ample time for that to take place. The longest confirmation process for a single nominee has been 125 days. On historic average, it takes 25 days to confirm or reject a nominee. As of today, the Senate has 216 days until the first Monday in October. If the Senate were to refuse to consider any of President Obama's nominations--and they have said they want the next President to make the appointment--there has been no indication that they will give expedited consideration to the next President's nomination. It could be well into the next year by the time the new Justice is confirmed and sworn in. Even on an expedited schedule, the new President would not be able to nominate anyone until they are sworn in on January 20. The Senate Judiciary Committee would need time to prepare for hearings, which could not occur until probably February. And then the full Senate would need time to consider the nomination, with the confirmation not likely until probably March. {time} 1930 Now, by March of a term, the term is effectively about over. Most of the oral arguments have already taken place and they are into decisions. You can't participate in a decision if you skip the oral argument. So not only would the vacancy occur through the rest of this term, almost half of a Supreme Court term, it would be well into the next term and, effectively, through most of the next term. There is no excuse to leave the Court vacancy open in what then would be a historic new precedence. There is no precedence for keeping a vacancy open that long. We need the justice appointed. The Senate ought to do its job. The President has indicated that he will do his job, as mandated by the Constitution, and so the Senate ought to just fulfill its responsibility under the Constitution and consider an appointment. Otherwise, you will have a vacancy not only through the rest of this term--and oral arguments have been taking place--you will have the vacancy through the rest of this term. You don't need a vacancy through the entire rest of the next term. There is plenty of time to consider and vote up or down on a nomination. And the unprecedented vacancy that would occur if the Senate fulfills its threat to stonewall any nomination is just unprecedented. So I want to thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for giving us the opportunity to just say a word about the importance of everyone in our democracy fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. The President shall appoint, and the Senate shall consider, advise and consent, so that we can have a Supreme Court Justice appointed before the first Monday in October. We have plenty of time to do that. There is no excuse for not doing it, and we expect the Senate to do its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia for highlighting several important points, including the fact that there is no election year exception in Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. This is all in Mitch McConnell's mind, cooked up in some partisan laboratory in order to stop this President from being able to move forward and do the business of the American people. We shouldn't be surprised, because we know Mitch McConnell stated very early on that his objective was to grind everything to a halt here in the Capitol to try to prevent President Obama from being re-elected. Not my words, his words. But here's the thing. President Obama was re-elected in an electoral college landslide. And his opponent in that race, Mitt Romney, tried to make it, in part, an election that was a referendum on the possibility that President Obama would have the opportunity to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. That issue was laid before the American people by President Obama's opponent, and the American people responded, processed all of the facts, and decided to re-elect President Obama, send him back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The American people did their job. The President is prepared to do his job. The Senate Republicans need to do their job as well. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to someone who has been a stalwart for justice in this institution, a revered Member of the House of Representatives, the great whip of House Democrats, and someone who has the respect of everyone in the United [[Page H1039]] States Capitol and beyond for his service to the House and his service to the country, a great friend to the Congressional Black Caucus, and we are so thankful that he is present here today. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York (Mr. Jeffries) for his excellent presentation. I want to thank Mr. Scott, who, as the gentleman observed, is one of the leaders in this Congress on the Constitution and on the law and on equal justice. I want to thank my friend from Ohio, the gentlewoman from Ohio, for her remarks. I noticed that the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, formerly a judge on the Court in North Carolina, is here. Mr. Speaker, I want to first say that I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for sponsoring this Special Order. I want to tell every Member, and all Americans ought to know, this is not an issue related to one group, to one gender, to one race, to one nationality. The failure to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court will affect every American. So we rise tonight to ask the Senate to do its duty. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here on the floor this evening with my distinguished colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order. The Supreme Court now has a vacancy, as everyone knows, that must be filled. The American people deserve a Supreme Court operating at full strength. Mr. Speaker, I am old enough to have been alive at the time that John Kennedy was assassinated. Within hours of his death, we swore in Lyndon Johnson as President of the United States because we wanted to make sure that there was a continuity of service. As sad and as tragic as those hours were, the responsibility of having a President of the United States was met within just a few hours. Mr. Speaker, when a vacancy occurs in this House--and there are, after all, 434 of us left when that happens--the State laws put a time limit on the Governors' action to call an election so that that vacancy can be filled. Why? Because the Constitution of those States do not want to have a vacancy exist for very long and have their State or their district not represented. Now, there is not a time limit with respect to the Supreme Court, per se. And the reason for that, of course, is the process, as Mr. Scott just pointed out, sometimes take a little longer, sometimes takes a little shorter. But in 7 months, as the gentleman pointed out, they had three nominees considered. Two were defeated after debate and a vote, and the third was confirmed. The process worked, and it worked in the last year of an administration. President Obama has a constitutional responsibility to nominate a candidate for the Court that will exercise sound judgment, uphold the principle that all people are created equal and must be treated equally under the laws. The Founders of our country very wisely made the number on the Supreme Court an odd number, not an even number, because the Founders did not want gridlock. Now we are used to gridlock in this Congress. But they did not want gridlock on the Court, and so they provided for a decision to be made by five members out of nine. Now, however, with four and four, they will maybe not be able to make a decision. That was not contemplated by the Founders, nor would it have been welcomed by the Founders. Shamefully, Senate Republicans have said they have no intention of even meeting with a nominee put forward by President Obama. That is not only disrespectful of the President of the United States, Barack Obama, but it is contrary to the best interest of the Supreme Court, but more importantly, to the people of this country. It is appalling that Republicans would prefer to leave a vacancy on the Supreme Court, thereby rendering it in some cases unable to make a decision, unable to perform its duties of being the final arbiter when circuits may differ on an issue. If Members of one party or another were simply to ignore the other side and refuse to carry out their duties within a divided government, our democracy would break down, and in some respects it has. We ought not to carry that conduct to the Supreme Court. We must not let that happen and we must not allow this Supreme Court vacancy to remain unfilled. The Court currently has a number, as the gentleman from New York has pointed out, of major cases pending that require a decision; not to be remanded to a lower court, because if that is done, that judgment may stand for that circuit, but there will be other circuits around the country who may make a different decision. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court has been a powerful safeguard of American's liberty and equality over the past century and beyond. From recognizing the right of every child to attend desegregated schools, to protecting every loving couple who wishes to marry, the Court has breathed life into the words of our Declaration of Independence that all are ``created equal, and they are endowed by their Creator,'' not by us, not by the Constitution, ``by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.'' That may be self-evident, Mr. Speaker, but it is not self-executed. And we have established the Supreme Court of the United States to make a decision so that that can be realized. Melissa Hart, Director of the Byron White Center, a former member of the Supreme Court for Constitutional Law at the University of Denver said, if we don't act, ``It would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve legal questions.'' Caroline Frederickson, president of the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy, wrote on February 19, ``It would be unfathomable to go through this term,'' and as Mr. Scott pointed out, the next term, ``with a Supreme Court hobbled by a vacancy.'' Mr. Speaker, let me remind you again, if a President dies, immediately we fill the vacancy. If a Member of Congress dies, every State has a time limit in which that must be filled so that democracy can be represented and operate in the way our Founders wanted it to operate. When the President nominates a candidate to the Court, the Senate, in my view, Mr. Speaker, has a responsibility under the Constitution to give that nominee every due consideration. They do not have a constitutional responsibility to approve it, as Mr. Scott has pointed out, but they have a responsibility to consider it. We must not allow politics, we must not allow politics, we must not allow politics to allow the obstruction of this most essential institution of our democracy and the rule of law. I want to thank my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for leading this Special Order and for their efforts to hold Senate Republicans accountable for their blatantly irresponsible action on this matter. Mr. Speaker, there is always another election. It may be 2 years away, it may be 4 years away, but if we adopt the principle that if we don't think we can win now, we will obstruct now and hope to win later, America and Americans will not be well-served. I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Democratic whip for a very insightful and powerful observation, for pointing that the very fabric of the United States Constitution is threatened by the willingness of Senate Republicans to abdicate their legislative responsibilities to hold hearings and act on a nomination put forth by the President of the United States of America. {time} 1945 It is now my great honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, as was pointed out by Mr. Hoyer, a former prominent member of the North Carolina judiciary, a legal scholar, a historian, and, of course, the leader of the conscience of the Congress here in the United States House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the chairman, G.K. Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me begin tonight by thanking the gentleman, Mr. Jeffries, for yielding to [[Page H1040]] me this evening and to thank him for his extraordinary friendship and leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus. I want to publicly thank you for coming to my district this past weekend. You spoke--some would say you preached--at Mount Vernon Baptist Church in Durham, North Carolina, and I thank you so very much for the message that you brought to my constituents in North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, moments after the death of Justice Scalia, the majority leader of the United States Senate announced to the country in a tone of defiance that the Senate will not consider any nomination--any nomination--of President Barack Obama to replace Justice Scalia. Mr. Speaker, the American people can see right through this. Though I represent a Democratic-leaning district in North Carolina, I represent many Republicans in North Carolina. Many of them have told me how disappointed they are with the Senate Republican leadership in making this announcement. Senator McConnell is reinforcing the Republican political agenda to disrupt--to disrupt--governmental functions when the circumstances do not line up with their conservative philosophy. It is imperative that we have nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court deciding constitutional issues that are important to the American people. The irony in all of this is that my Republican friends constantly on this floor talk about strict construction of the Constitution. A strict construction of the Constitution, as Mr. Hoyer said a moment ago, requires the President to nominate an individual once there is a vacancy on the Court. The Senate, the United States Senate, has the awesome responsibility of having a hearing, deciding, and confirming the nomination by an up-or-down vote. So it is absurd to suggest that President Obama should be denied the opportunity to nominate a qualified Justice to replace Justice Scalia. The American people should clearly understand that Senate Republicans have a political agenda to pack the Court with conservative Justices who would reverse years of commonsense progressive jurisprudence. So the Congressional Black Caucus tonight demands Senate Republicans to stop the complete blockade and the blatant disrespect of our President. Senate Republicans' outright refusal to hold a hearing on any individual nominated by the President to serve on the Court is an affront to our Constitution and the American people. Such divisive actions undermine our democracy and reduce our standing in the world. This blockade is an obstruction and runs afoul of the duties held by those who hold a seat in the august Chamber of the United States Senate. I have read that Senator Grassley, Senator McConnell, and others will meet with President Obama this week. I hope they meet. I hope they sit together and reconcile their differences because this issue needs to be put to rest. We call on Senate Republicans to hold hearings once President Obama submits his nomination and follow the procedures set forth in the Constitution. In short and in closing, the Congressional Black Caucus, the 45, 46 members of the Congressional Black Caucus--and, indeed, the American people--have one message--one message--for Senate Republicans: Do your job. Don't play partisanship. Don't play a partisan game with the Supreme Court of the United States of America. It is too serious. It is too important. Thank you very much, Mr. Jeffries. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished chair for pointing out that this is a simple question for Senate Republicans: Do your job consistent with your obligations and responsibilities under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. The Senate Republicans' failure to act or consider any nominee put forth by the President of the United States of America is an abdication of responsibility, a dereliction of duty, and it would be a stunning act of legislative malpractice that undermines the rule of law, the Presidency, the Supreme Court, the United States Constitution, as well as the American people. I am thankful now to be joined by someone who is a powerful voice for the voiceless here in the House of Representatives, who has ably served her constituents in northern California and consistently fought for a fair, equitable society. Let me now yield to my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from California, Representative Barbara Lee. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from New York for yielding, but also for his tremendous leadership. You and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty from Ohio really have sounded the alarm, beat the drum, and really brought to the American people the important issues that we are dealing with each and every day, so I just have to thank you for your diligence and for staying the course. Every week you are here, you are representing not only this Congress, but the country very, very well. So thank you. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with all my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus, with our whip, Mr. Hoyer, and others to urge our Republican colleagues in the Senate to, of course, do your job. Also, let me just remind us, once again, the President is trying to meet his constitutional obligation once again. He is trying to do what he is supposed to do, and that is to nominate Justice Scalia's replacement to our Nation's highest Court. And Senate Republicans have a constitutional responsibility to give the President's nominee a speedy and fair hearing, followed up with a simple up-or-down vote. Sadly, these Senate Republicans said ``no'' to their constitutional responsibility. The Supreme Court has a huge responsibility of deciding cases that impact every aspect of American life, from our elections, college admissions, to scientific patents and a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions. It is imperative that the Supreme Court be allowed to function in its full capacity with nine Justices. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was appointed by a conservative President, President Ronald Reagan, did not mince words in her condemnation of Republicans playing politics with the Court. She said: ``We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it.'' Former Justice O'Connor, I could not agree more. Despite the calls for action and a constitutional mandate, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said that there will be no hearings, no votes, not even a meeting with President Obama to discuss the late Justice Scalia's replacement. That is just wrong. His actions prompted The New York Times to editorialize that he ``seems to have lost touch with reality and the Constitution,'' speaking of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a couple of New York Times articles. [From the New York Times, Feb. 17, 2016] Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor (By Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin) Charleston, SC.--As he left Martha Lou's Kitchen, a soul food institution here on Wednesday, Edward Gadsden expressed irritation about the Republican determination to block President Obama from selecting Justice Antonin Scalia's replacement on the Supreme Court. ``They've been fighting that man since he's been there,'' Mr. Gadsden, who is African-American, said of Mr. Obama, before pointing at his forearm to explain what he said was driving the Republican opposition: ``The color of his skin, that's all, the color of his skin.'' When Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after Mr. Scalia's death on Saturday that the next president, rather than Mr. Obama, should select a successor, the senator's words struck a familiar and painful chord with many black voters. After years of watching political opponents question the president's birthplace and his faith, and hearing a member of Congress shout ``You lie!'' at him from the House floor, some African-Americans saw the move by Senate Republicans as another attempt to deny the legitimacy of the country's first black president. And they call it increasingly infuriating after Mr. Obama has spent seven years in the White House and won two resounding election victories. ``Our president, the president of the United States, has been disrespected from Day 1,'' Carol Richardson, 61, said on Wednesday as she colored a customer's hair at Ultra Beauty Saloh in Hollywood, S.C., a mostly black town near Charleston. ``The words that have been said, the things the Republicans have done they'd have never have done to another president. Let's talk like it is, it's because of his skin color.'' [[Page H1041]] Reflecting on the Supreme Court vacancy, Bakari Sellers, a former state representative from Denmark, S.C., likened the Senate treatment of the president to the 18th century constitutional compromise that counted black men as equivalent to three-fifths of a person. ``I guess many of them are using this in the strictest construction that Barack Obama's serving three-fifths of a term or he's three-fifths of a human being, so he doesn't get to make this choice,'' Mr. Sellers said. ``It's infuriating.'' The anger and outrage that Mr. McConnell's position has touched off among African-Americans could have implications for the presidential election. Leading African-American Democrats are trying to use it to motivate rank-and-file blacks to vote in November, the first presidential election in a decade in which Mr. Obama will not be on the ballot and in which Democrats fear black participation could drop. ``Anger becomes action when it's directly tied to a moment, and the moment now is the election on Nov. 8,'' said Stacey Abrams, a Democratic state representative from Georgia and the House minority leader there, adding that Mr. Scalia's death meant that this presidential campaign could no longer be construed as a mere ``thought exercise.'' For Hillary Clinton, who is increasingly relying on nonwhite voters to ensure her success against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the court issue could be especially crucial. Should she defeat Mr. Sanders, who has electrified many liberals, she will need a motivating issue to bring Mr. Obama's loyalists to the polls. She moved swiftly Tuesday to tap into the anger of blacks over the opposition of Senate Republicans to Mr. Obama's naming a replacement for Justice Scalia. ``Now the Republicans say they'll reject anyone President Obama nominates no matter how qualified,'' Mrs. Clinton said in remarks before a predominantly black audience in Harlem. ``Some are even saying he doesn't have the right to nominate anyone! As if somehow he's not the real president.'' Doing so, Mrs. Clinton added, is in keeping with a longstanding pattern of mistreatment. ``They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe,'' she said. ``This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.'' Republicans are especially sensitive about the notion that they are diminishing Mr. Obama because of his race, and spokesmen for several Republican senators, including Mr. McConnell and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, declined to comment or would not make the senators available for comment. The suggestion that racism is playing a role angers Mr. McConnell's friends, who point out that his formative political experience was working for a Republican senator who supported civil rights, that he helped override President Ronald Reagan's veto of sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa and that he is married to an Asian-American woman. But in the aftermath of Mr. McConnell's statement on Saturday, a growing chorus of black voices is complaining that such a refusal to even consider a Supreme Court nominee would never occur with a white president. ``It's more than a political motive--it has a smell of racism,'' said Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``I can tick instance after instance over the last seven years where Republicans have purposely tried to diminish the president's authority,'' Mr. Butterfield said. ``This is just really extreme, and leads me to the conclusion that if this was any other president who was not African-American, it would not have been handled this way.'' Even as Mr. Obama's popularity has risen and fallen, his base of support among black voters has been unshakable. A Gallup tracking poll this month showed that some 85 percent of African-Americans approved of the president's performance compared with only 36 percent of whites. And many African- Americans strongly identify personally with Mr. Obama, and have watched his tenure with pride. Mr. Butterfield said that he believed that the effort to undermine, and even delegitimize, Mr. Obama began soon after he was sworn in, and that Congressional Republicans had blocked Mr. Obama's agenda wherever they could. Even more stinging were the suggestions from some on the right that Mr. Obama, a Christian, is actually a Muslim and that he was not born in the United States. In interviews, members of the Congressional Black Caucus also bitterly recounted indignities, such as demands--most pointedly from the current Republican front-runner in the polls, Donald J. Trump, in 2011--that Mr. Obama prove he was born in Hawaii, and not in Kenya, as some critics claimed. Others recalled the calls to impeach Mr. Obama over his use of executive authority. ``You hear the thing about: `He's not a citizen. He oversteps his bounds. He's divisive.' One thing after another,'' said Representative Marcia L. Fudge, Democrat of Ohio. ``This has been going on since the day he was elected in 2008.'' Republicans have had more success than Democrats in recent decades galvanizing their voters over who should control the courts. But Jennifer McClellan, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Democratic National Committee, said the dispute over how to replace Justice Scalia could now become ``an issue for the average citizen.'' Ms. Abrams agreed, saying the Supreme Court and its powerful influence on people's lives is especially resonant with blacks. ``Congress is denying our president his rights as a president, but, more than that, they're denying the legacy of his presidency,'' she said. ``That will animate Democratic voters across the board but especially African- Americans, who realize more than many voters how great an impact the Supreme Court can have on freedom.'' ____ [From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 2016] Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat (By the Editorial Board) Following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Republicans apparently believe they can profit by creating a political crisis that the nation has never seen before. On Tuesday, the leadership doubled down on its refusal to take any action on any nominee from President Obama to replace Justice Scalia. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader who seems to have lost touch with reality and the Constitution, accused Mr. Obama of plunging the nation into a ``bitter and avoidable struggle'' should he name anyone to the court. Forget an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Top Republicans are pledging not to hold hearings or even to meet with a nominee. In a statement dripping with sarcasm, Mr. McConnell said that Mr. Obama ``has every right to nominate someone,'' and ``even if doing so will inevitably plunge our nation into another bitter and avoidable struggle, that is his right. Even if he never expects that nominee to actually be confirmed but rather to wield as an electoral cudgel, that is his right.'' Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, said, ``We believe the American people need to decide who is going to make this appointment rather than a lame-duck president.'' These statements are so twisted that it's hard to know where to begin. Let's take them one by one. First, Mr. Obama is not a ``lame-duck president.'' The lame-duck period is broadly understood to run from after the November election until a new president is inaugurated in January. November is more than eight months off. Based on the average number of days it has taken the Senate to act on previous Supreme Court nominees, the seat could be filled by this spring. Second, no matter how often Republicans repeat the phrase ``let the people decide,'' that's not how the system works. The Constitution vests the power to make nominations to the court in the president, not ``the people.'' In any case, the people have already decided who should make this appointment: They elected Mr. Obama twice, by large margins. Third, it is preposterous to accuse Mr. Obama of causing a ``bitter struggle'' by nominating someone who will not be confirmed. The only reason a nominee would not be confirmed is that the Senate has pre-emptively decided to block any nominee sight unseen. Mr. Obama is once again the only adult in the room, carrying out his constitutional obligation while Senate Republicans scramble to dig up examples of Democrats trying to block nominees. But those examples show only that Democratic senators have pushed hard for Republican presidents to pick ideologically moderate nominees. Until now, neither party has ever vowed to shut down the nomination process entirely, even before it has begun. Only two Republican senators, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine, were brave enough to say that they would vote on President Obama's nominee. This is what passes for moderation in today's G.O.P.: simply stating a willingness to do the job you were elected to do. Unfortunately, for too many Republicans moderation now equals apostasy. These Republicans have stubbornly parked themselves so far to the right for so many years that it is hard to tell whether they can hear how deranged they sound. The truth is they are afraid--and they should be. They know Mr. Obama has a large pool of extremely smart and thoroughly mainstream candidates from which to choose a nominee. They know that if the American people were allowed to hear such a person answer questions in a Senate hearing, they would wonder what all the fuss was about. So Mr. McConnell and his colleagues plan to shut their doors, plug their ears and hope the public doesn't notice. The Republican spin machine is working overtime to rationalize this behavior. Don't be fooled. It is panic masquerading as strength. Ms. LEE. One of the titles of these articles is ``Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor.'' The other is The New York Times article, ``Senate Republicans Lose Their Minds on a Supreme Court Seat.'' Likewise, Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley of Iowa led a letter to the majority leader signed by all the Republican Committee members confirming their resolve to not have hearings or a vote on the nominee. [[Page H1042]] This is downright ludicrous. Republicans cannot and should not use the Supreme Court to push their radical political agenda. The Constitution is clear, Mr. Speaker. Article II, section 2, ``He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . . . shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court.'' Nowhere in the Constitution does it say, ``except in an election year'' or ``except when the President is a Democrat'' or ``when Republicans have spent the last 7 years actively working to subvert every policy proposed by a President elected by nearly 70 million Americans.'' The Constitution doesn't say that. This is simply unacceptable, and the American people deserve better. For more than a century, every single Supreme Court nominee has received a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Just like all the Presidents before him, President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice, and the Senate should determine if he or she is fit to serve on this Nation's High Court. Instead, Republicans are holding the Supreme Court and the American people hostage. Their action, in the words of The New York Times, is simply, ``panic masquerading as strength.'' The Senate has a responsibility to at least consider the President's Supreme Court nominee, and by refusing to do so, they are failing their constituents and their Nation. So, Mr. Speaker, it is really past time for Majority Leader McConnell and the rest of the Republican leadership to do their jobs and work together to get a new Supreme Court Justice. The Supreme Court is way too important to be used as a political bargaining chip. Enough is enough. So, once again, I join my colleagues, Congressman Jeffries, Congresswoman Beatty, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and the American people in saying, ``Do your job.'' Once again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join with you tonight. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from California for making several important points as it relates to the absence of any partisanship exception in the United States Constitution, the absence of any exception whereby the Senate will do its job unless, of course, President Barack Obama happens to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I see that nowhere within the four corners of the United States Constitution. I don't see an election year exception in the United States Constitution. So I am perplexed as to what is the situation we find ourselves in right now. I thought that I may ask the distinguished gentlewoman, my colleague, my coanchor from Ohio, to reflect upon, if you might, a few comments that could shed light on the situation we find ourselves in right now as it relates to the Supreme Court vacancy made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over the years during his time here in Congress. In 1986, Mitch McConnell said: ``I believe that a heavy burden must be met by those who would have this nominee rejected. Under the Constitution, our duty is to provide advice and consent to judicial nominations, not to substitute our judgment for what are reasonable views for a judicial nominee to hold.'' That was in 1986. Then in 1990, he said: ``It is clear under our form of government that the advice and consent role of the Senate in judicial nominations should not be politicized.'' That was Mitch McConnell in 1990. In 2005, he said: ``Our job is to react to that nomination in a respectful and dignified way, and at the end of the process, to give that person an up-or-down vote as all nominees who have majority support have gotten throughout the history of the country.'' I am trying to figure out what has changed, Representative Beatty. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries. Hearing you quote those things, three things come to mind. First, let me say that Congressman Steny Hoyer was absolutely right when he says that this issue of not filling the vacancy is not related to only one group. So I want to say, after hearing what you said and many others of our members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is important for us to know why we are calling on the Senate Republicans to do their job, and that is because we are the voice for those who are not often represented. We are the voice for those when you talk about issues related to women and women's rights, when you talk about issues that are related to things that affect you and me, and when you talk about the article that Congresswoman Barbara Lee entered into the Record, ``Blacks See Bias in Delay on a Scalia Successor.'' Now, that article says it all. That article specifically states that many folks believe, in this wonderful America that we live in, that it is also because of the color of his skin. I think that is another reason that we come as a strong 46 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, because the facts work against them. Think about it. When we look at the number of people who have been appointed, when we look at the number of days, if you look at since 1975, it has only taken an average of 67 days to confirm a President's nominee to the Supreme Court. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, and there are 325 days left in President Obama's term. {time} 2000 Since the early 1900s, six Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in an election year. When I think about your question and I think about your sharing with us some of the comments that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said, let me add this one to the Record. And it is something he got right. He said that the American people should have the right to choose the President who will pick the next Supreme Court Justice deciding the future balance of the Nation's highest court. Well, he got that right. Because you know what. The people did pick the President when they picked President Barack Obama in 2012, who won the election by 5 million votes. I am calling on him and the Senate Republicans to do their job, to allow the President to do what the Constitution tells us, to allow the President, who has already said that he is going to bring somebody who is full of scholarship, he is going to bring someone who is committed and capable to doing the people's work--I wanted to add that to your statement and share with everyone tonight that is why we are here. Mr. JEFFRIES. I really appreciate that. As we are simply trying to point out, all we are asking for is for the Senate to adhere to its constitutional responsibilities and, when the President sends forth a nominee, to conduct a rigorous hearing process before the American people and then, at the end of that process, provide that nominee with an up-or-down vote before the Judiciary Committee and then, ultimately, the floor of the United States Senate. Now, I have been in this institution for a little over 3 years. If I had a dollar for every time some of my colleagues mentioned strict adherence to the United States Constitution, I would be a billionaire right now. For the life of me, I can't understand what is so complicated about this particular issue. As Representative Beatty so ably pointed out, from this moment, there are 325 days remaining in the Presidency of Barack Obama. As this chart illustrates, if you just take a look at the current occupants of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice, the most important position on the Supreme Court, a 23-day confirmation process; Justice Scalia, confirmed in 85 days; Justice Kagan, 87 days; Justice Sotomayor, 66 days; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a/k/a the notorious RBG--one of my personal favorites--50 days; Justice Clarence Thomas, 99 days. You can add some of these confirmation periods together and you still wouldn't get to 325. So what is the problem? Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining on my Special Order today? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 12 minutes remaining. [[Page H1043]] General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, one of the concerns that I think we in the Congressional Black Caucus have as it relates to the Presidency of President Obama--and Representative Beatty pointed this out--is that there is a feeling in many corners of America that this President is treated differently. I am not sure if it is because there are some people here in the Capitol who have something against folks from Hawaii. I am not sure if it is his Kansas roots. I don't know if they dislike the fact that he was a community organizer in terms of one of the jobs that he held after school. I don't know if they dislike the fact that he is so well educated from Columbia and Harvard Law Schools. I don't know if it is the fact that he was the President of the Harvard Law Review or a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, one of the top five law schools in this country. I don't really know what it is about Barack Obama that they want to treat him differently than almost any other President who has served at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I am trying to figure it out. What is it about Barack Obama that he has to be treated with such disrespect? The amazing thing to me is that they have actually failed to stop this President. They gave him no assistance as it relates to trying to turn the economy around. He inherited a train wreck from George W. Bush and has gotten the economy back on track. Not a single Member from the other side of the aisle voted for the stimulus package, which was necessary to stabilize the economy and then build it up. There was 71 consecutive months of private sector job creation, and 14 million-plus private sector jobs were created under this Presidency. The unemployment rate has gone from over 10 percent to under 5 percent. The stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. The deficit has been reduced by more than $1 trillion. Gas prices are below $2 per gallon. More than 18 million previously uninsured Americans now have health coverage. Not a single one of those accomplishments occurred with a vote from the other side of the aisle. What is it about this President that they don't like? Now, in his final term--and, by the way, speaking to strict constructionists--when you look at the United States Constitution, I can't find a 3-year term. I can't find it. It is a 4-year term with 325 days left. All we are asking is that they just do their job. It is pretty simple. Give whoever the President puts forth a fair hearing. They have the votes to defeat any of his nominees. Let me ask my colleague from Ohio. What I haven't been able to understand is this Justice who I have disagreed with on many issues. Although he was strong--Justice Scalia--on the privacy rights of the American people, the Fourth Amendment--was concerned about the criminalization of politics, these are areas where there is some common ground. And certainly he was a giant in terms of legal thought. The news of his demise was barely out for public consumption when Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying: We are not considering anyone that President Obama puts forth. How do you explain that? How do you interpret that reaction? We couldn't even respect the death of Justice Scalia before the vacancy was politicized, before he was even buried and funeralized. Mrs. BEATTY. Congressman Jeffries, I think you answered that question for me when you gave the long list of successes that this President has done without their help. That gave me pause to think: What is it that is keeping them from doing their job? Why is it that they are so threatened? Maybe it is the success that this President has brought forth not for you and I, not for the 435 Members of us, but he has done this for this Nation. He has made it a better place. When we look at what the Justices do and represent, when we think about liberties and freedoms and the economy and our rights, I think they are afraid that he will appoint someone who will have that same scholarship, who will have that same success, someone who will bring balance. I think they are afraid of the balance. In the words of another one of our colleagues, I might add, from the great State of Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus--she has words that she is entering, but I would like to quote from her words to remind us why we are saying: Senate Republicans, do your job. She reminds us, as Members of Congress, we made a promise to our constituents that we would faithfully discharge the duties and the oath of office which we took, which we were elected to. She reminded me in her words that it is so important for us to say tonight to the Senate: Do your job. Do your job. I think they are afraid. So I am going to issue a challenge. Congresswoman Barbara Lee said that you are here tonight initiating this topic because we are sounding the alarm, we are ringing the bell. I challenge them to answer that question. I challenge them to share with not only the Congressional Black Caucus, not only the Members of Congress, not only the Members of the Senate, but they have an obligation to America, to the citizens of these United States, Mr. Speaker, for them to tell us why they are not doing their job. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for those very powerful words. I can only hope, as we close this Special Order hour, that our colleagues from across this Capitol will see fit simply to adhere to their constitutional responsibilities to consider any nominee put forth by President Obama comprehensively and fairly and to faithfully execute those obligations consistent with their oath of office, not for the good of this President, not for the good of this Article I Congress, but for the good of the United States of America. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,55323,55323,55393,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [house] [pages h1037-h1043] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1915 supreme court vacancy the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from new york (mr. jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to once again stand on the floor of the house of representatives along with my distinguished colleague from ohio, representative joyce beatty, coanchor of this cbc special order hour, this hour of power where, for the next 60 minutes, we will have an opportunity to speak directly to the american people about an issue of grave importance to the integrity of our democracy, and that is making sure that the united states senate fulfills their constitutional obligation to advise and consent as it relates to considering any supreme court nomination that president obama sends up to that body. we know that justice antonin scalia has moved on after a long and distinguished career. though i disagree with almost every single judicial opinion that he has issued, he served this nation well. now that he has moved on, the supreme court, which is contained in article iii of the united states constitution, has a vacancy. it is the obligation of the united states senate to fill that vacancy by considering whatever nominee president barack obama sends forward. members of the united states senate take an oath of office to faithfully discharge their responsibilities. when you look at article ii, section 2, of the united states constitution, which gives the president the power to nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the supreme court, it is the senate that must consider that nominee. since the early part of the 20th century, there have been eight different supreme court nominees who have been voted on in an election year. six of them actually were confirmed, but all eight of them received a hearing. so, for the life of me, i can't figure out why senator mitch mcconnell thinks that he can get away with holding a nomination up without even the slightest bit of consideration. so we are going to explore that here today. we will be joined by any number of distinguished members of the house of representatives and the congressional black caucus, but let me proceed by yielding to my good friend and colleague from ohio (mrs. beatty), my dynamic coanchor who does such a tremendous job on behalf of the people of the great state of ohio and the city of columbus. mrs. beatty. thank you so much, congressman jeffries. it is certainly an honor and a privilege for me to join you this evening as coanchor for this congressional black caucus special order hour. congressman jeffries' scholarship and distinguished talents as a member of the judiciary committee have not gone unnoticed. i thank him for leading by example in challenging us to initiate and follow through in sending a message on senate republicans' refusal to act on the supreme court vacancy. in part, tonight's congressional black caucus special order hour, senate republicans: do your job, does just that. as you reflected in your opening statement, article ii, section 2, of the constitution expressly designates that the president has a duty to name and the senate has a responsibility to advise and consent a nominee to fill the seat. president obama takes this very seriously. he has stated: ``it's a decision to which i devote considerable time, deep reflection, careful deliberation, and serious consultation with legal experts, members of both political parties, and people across the political spectrum.'' but republicans have made a decision to completely refuse consideration of anyone that president obama nominates to the supreme court. in fact, they have stated that they won't hold a hearing or a vote before the full senate. senate democrats never acted so recklessly when faced with this situation in 1988, when there was a vote to confirm justice kennedy. there was no talk of doing nothing until after that year's election because it was unthinkable then to leave the court shorthanded for that long. and it remains so now. the power of the court, mr. speaker, is reflected in the work it does. its decisions often shape the policy as profoundly as any law passed by congress or any action taken by the president of these united states. when we look back to our history, especially as african americans, the importance of the decisions handed down by the supreme court cannot be overstated. for example, most of us are familiar with brown v. board of education in 1954, which reversed plessy v. ferguson and its ``separate but equal'' ruling. striking down segregation in our nation's public schools provided a major catalyst for the civil rights movement and made advances in desegregating housing, public accommodations, and institutions of higher education possible. after brown, the nation made some great strides towards opening the doors of education to all students. unfortunately, the promise of the brown decision remains unfulfilled in many ways. more than 2 million black students attend schools where 90 percent of the student body is made up of minority students. on average, schools serving more minority populations have less experienced, lower paid teachers who are less likely to be certified. a report from the center for american progress found that a 10 percent point increase in students of color at a school is associated with a decrease in per-pupil spending of $75. in many ways, more than 60 years after brown v. board of education school systems in the united states are still separate and unequal. and we are just not witnessing educational disparities at the elementary and secondary education level. college enrollment is racially polarized. white students are overrepresented in selective colleges, which have more resources to educate and to support them, while african american students are overrepresented in less selective institutions. mr. speaker and congressman jeffries, you see where i am going with that. [[page h1038]] this is also why the late justice scalia's comments during oral arguments of the pending united states supreme court case, fisher v. university of texas at austin, were so disturbing. he stated, in part: maybe the university of texas ought to have fewer african americans. these comments are inaccurate and insulting to me and to african americans. they undervalue the historic achievement that african americans have made. thousands of black americans have excelled to the top tier of their universities. many of them you will hear from tonight because they are members of the congressional black caucus. they are scholars. they are the conscience of the congress. they represent the diversity of america's best universities and of america's historically black colleges and universities. mr. jeffries. i thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her wonderful thoughts and observations, and i look forward to our continued dialogue. it is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman from virginia (mr. scott), one of those individuals that representative beatty mentioned who is really a legal giant amongst us. he is someone who has served this institution well. he understands the constitution, the notion of separation of powers, and the importance of a fair and equitable justice system. mr. scott of virginia. i thank the gentleman from new york and the gentlewoman from ohio for organizing tonight's special order to call on our colleagues in the senate to do their job and provide their advice and consent on the president's upcoming nomination to the united states supreme court. the constitution is pretty clear on this issue. article ii, section 2, doesn't say the president might or the president should. it says the president shall nominate, and by and with advice and consent of the senate, appoint judges to the supreme court. there seems to be some suggestion that, if it is an election year, he ought to skip that process and let the next president make the appointment. they say there is very little precedence for a president nominating somebody in an election year. that might be technically correct, but the fact of the matter is that there have been virtually no vacancies that have occurred during an election year. i think the last one was about almost 50 years. in that case, an appointment was made and considered. that is the process that ought to take place in this case. the rarity of such an event should not preclude the senate from fulfilling its constitutional responsibility. there is precedent for the president nominating and the senate at least considering the nomination during an election year. now, justice kennedy was confirmed in an election year in 1988. that was a 7-month process that began with the appointment of robert bork to the supreme court. his nomination was considered and defeated. and then there was the appointment of douglas ginsburg. we will just say his nomination went up in smoke. and then we had the nomination and confirmation of justice kennedy. in 7 months, from start to finish, another nomination was made and collapsed and another nomination made, all within 7 months. we could complete that entire process by the first monday in october, the beginning of the supreme court session. there is no precedence for the president declining to nominate somebody and virtually no precedence for the senate just to ignore a nomination that is made. the people overwhelmingly reelected president obama in 2012 to a term that does not end until january 20, 2017, and we fully expect the president to fulfill his duty to nominate a qualified individual to the supreme court to fill the current vacancy. a failure of the senate to act this year would be unprecedented. there is ample time for that to take place. the longest confirmation process for a single nominee has been 125 days. on historic average, it takes 25 days to confirm or reject a nominee. as of today, the senate has 216 days until the first monday in october. if the senate were to refuse to consider any of president obama's nominations--and they have said they want the next president to make the appointment--there has been no indication that they will give expedited consideration to the next president's nomination. it could be well into the next year by the time the new justice is confirmed and sworn in. even on an expedited schedule, the new president would not be able to nominate anyone until they are sworn in on january 20. the senate judiciary committee would need time to prepare for hearings, which could not occur until probably february. and then the full senate would need time to consider the nomination, with the confirmation not likely until probably march. {time} 1930 now, by march of a term, the term is effectively about over. most of the oral arguments have already taken place and they are into decisions. you can't participate in a decision if you skip the oral argument. so not only would the vacancy occur through the rest of this term, almost half of a supreme court term, it would be well into the next term and, effectively, through most of the next term. there is no excuse to leave the court vacancy open in what then would be a historic new precedence. there is no precedence for keeping a vacancy open that long. we need the justice appointed. the senate ought to do its job. the president has indicated that he will do his job, as mandated by the constitution, and so the senate ought to just fulfill its responsibility under the constitution and consider an appointment. otherwise, you will have a vacancy not only through the rest of this term--and oral arguments have been taking place--you will have the vacancy through the rest of this term. you don't need a vacancy through the entire rest of the next term. there is plenty of time to consider and vote up or down on a nomination. and the unprecedented vacancy that would occur if the senate fulfills its threat to stonewall any nomination is just unprecedented. so i want to thank the gentleman from new york and the gentlewoman from ohio for giving us the opportunity to just say a word about the importance of everyone in our democracy fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. the president shall appoint, and the senate shall consider, advise and consent, so that we can have a supreme court justice appointed before the first monday in october. we have plenty of time to do that. there is no excuse for not doing it, and we expect the senate to do its job. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i thank the distinguished gentleman from virginia for highlighting several important points, including the fact that there is no election year exception in article ii, section 2 of the united states constitution. this is all in mitch mcconnell's mind, cooked up in some partisan laboratory in order to stop this president from being able to move forward and do the business of the american people. we shouldn't be surprised, because we know mitch mcconnell stated very early on that his objective was to grind everything to a halt here in the capitol to try to prevent president obama from being re-elected. not my words, his words. but here's the thing. president obama was re-elected in an electoral college landslide. and his opponent in that race, mitt romney, tried to make it, in part, an election that was a referendum on the possibility that president obama would have the opportunity to fill a supreme court vacancy. that issue was laid before the american people by president obama's opponent, and the american people responded, processed all of the facts, and decided to re-elect president obama, send him back to 1600 pennsylvania avenue. the american people did their job. the president is prepared to do his job. the senate republicans need to do their job as well. it is now my honor and my privilege to yield to someone who has been a stalwart for justice in this institution, a revered member of the house of representatives, the great whip of house democrats, and someone who has the respect of everyone in the united [[page h1039]] states capitol and beyond for his service to the house and his service to the country, a great friend to the congressional black caucus, and we are so thankful that he is present here today. i yield to the gentleman from maryland (mr. hoyer), the democratic whip. mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i thank my friend from new york (mr. jeffries) for his excellent presentation. i want to thank mr. scott, who, as the gentleman observed, is one of the leaders in this congress on the constitution and on the law and on equal justice. i want to thank my friend from ohio, the gentlewoman from ohio, for her remarks. i noticed that the chair of the congressional black caucus, mr. g.k. butterfield, formerly a judge on the court in north carolina, is here. mr. speaker, i want to first say that i thank the congressional black caucus for sponsoring this special order. i want to tell every member, and all americans ought to know, this is not an issue related to one group, to one gender, to one race, to one nationality. the failure to fill the vacancy on the supreme court will affect every american. so we rise tonight to ask the senate to do its duty. mr. speaker, i am pleased to be here on the floor this evening with my distinguished colleagues from the congressional black caucus for this special order. the supreme court now has a vacancy, as everyone knows, that must be filled. the american people deserve a supreme court operating at full strength. mr. speaker, i am old enough to have been alive at the time that john kennedy was assassinated. within hours of his death, we swore in lyndon johnson as president of the united states because we wanted to make sure that there was a continuity of service. as sad and as tragic as those hours were, the responsibility of having a president of the united states was met within just a few hours. mr. speaker, when a vacancy occurs in this house--and there are, after all, 434 of us left when that happens--the state laws put a time limit on the governors' action to call an election so that that vacancy can be filled. why? because the constitution of those states do not want to have a vacancy exist for very long and have their state or their district not represented. now, there is not a time limit with respect to the supreme court, per se. and the reason for that, of course, is the process, as mr. scott just pointed out, sometimes take a little longer, sometimes takes a little shorter. but in 7 months, as the gentleman pointed out, they had three nominees considered. two were defeated after debate and a vote, and the third was confirmed. the process worked, and it worked in the last year of an administration. president obama has a constitutional responsibility to nominate a candidate for the court that will exercise sound judgment, uphold the principle that all people are created equal and must be treated equally under the laws. the founders of our country very wisely made the number on the supreme court an odd number, not an even number, because the founders did not want gridlock. now we are used to gridlock in this congress. but they did not want gridlock on the court, and so they provided for a decision to be made by five members out of nine. now, however, with four and four, they will maybe not be able to make a decision. that was not contemplated by the founders, nor would it have been welcomed by the founders. shamefully, senate republicans have said they have no intention of even meeting with a nominee put forward by president obama. that is not only disrespectful of the president of the united states, barack obama, but it is contrary to the best interest of the supreme court, but more importantly, to the people of this country. it is appalling that republicans would prefer to leave a vacancy on the supreme court, thereby rendering it in some cases unable to make a decision, unable to perform its duties of being the final arbiter when circuits may differ on an issue. if members of one party or another were simply to ignore the other side and refuse to carry out their duties within a divided government, our democracy would break down, and in some respects it has. we ought not to carry that conduct to the supreme court. we must not let that happen and we must not allow this supreme court vacancy to remain unfilled. the court currently has a number, as the gentleman from new york has pointed out, of major cases pending that require a decision; not to be remanded to a lower court, because if that is done, that judgment may stand for that circuit, but there will be other circuits around the country who may make a different decision. mr. speaker, the supreme court has been a powerful safeguard of american's liberty and equality over the past century and beyond. from recognizing the right of every child to attend desegregated schools, to protecting every loving couple who wishes to marry, the court has breathed life into the words of our declaration of independence that all are ``created equal, and they are endowed by their creator,'' not by us, not by the constitution, ``by their creator with certain unalienable rights.'' that may be self-evident, mr. speaker, but it is not self-executed. and we have established the supreme court of the united states to make a decision so that that can be realized. melissa hart, director of the byron white center, a former member of the supreme court for constitutional law at the university of denver said, if we don't act, ``it would be a monumental crisis for the development of the law and the need to resolve legal questions.'' caroline frederickson, president of the american constitution society for law and policy, wrote on february 19, ``it would be unfathomable to go through this term,'' and as mr. scott pointed out, the next term, ``with a supreme court hobbled by a vacancy.'' mr. speaker, let me remind you again, if a president dies, immediately we fill the vacancy. if a member of congress dies, every state has a time limit in which that must be filled so that democracy can be represented and operate in the way our founders wanted it to operate. when the president nominates a candidate to the court, the senate, in my view, mr. speaker, has a responsibility under the constitution to give that nominee every due consideration. they do not have a constitutional responsibility to approve it, as mr. scott has pointed out, but they have a responsibility to consider it. we must not allow politics, we must not allow politics, we must not allow politics to allow the obstruction of this most essential institution of our democracy and the rule of law. i want to thank my friends in the congressional black caucus for leading this special order and for their efforts to hold senate republicans accountable for their blatantly irresponsible action on this matter. mr. speaker, there is always another election. it may be 2 years away, it may be 4 years away, but if we adopt the principle that if we don't think we can win now, we will obstruct now and hope to win later, america and americans will not be well-served. i thank my friend for yielding. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i thank the distinguished democratic whip for a very insightful and powerful observation, for pointing that the very fabric of the united states constitution is threatened by the willingness of senate republicans to abdicate their legislative responsibilities to hold hearings and act on a nomination put forth by the president of the united states of america. {time} 1945 it is now my great honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished chairman of the congressional black caucus, as was pointed out by mr. hoyer, a former prominent member of the north carolina judiciary, a legal scholar, a historian, and, of course, the leader of the conscience of the congress here in the united states house of representatives. mr. speaker, i yield to the chairman, g.k. butterfield. mr. butterfield. mr. speaker, let me begin tonight by thanking the gentleman, mr. jeffries, for yielding to [[page h1040]] me this evening and to thank him for his extraordinary friendship and leadership in the congressional black caucus. i want to publicly thank you for coming to my district this past weekend. you spoke--some would say you preached--at mount vernon baptist church in durham, north carolina, and i thank you so very much for the message that you brought to my constituents in north carolina. mr. speaker, moments after the death of justice scalia, the majority leader of the united states senate announced to the country in a tone of defiance that the senate will not consider any nomination--any nomination--of president barack obama to replace justice scalia. mr. speaker, the american people can see right through this. though i represent a democratic-leaning district in north carolina, i represent many republicans in north carolina. many of them have told me how disappointed they are with the senate republican leadership in making this announcement. senator mcconnell is reinforcing the republican political agenda to disrupt--to disrupt--governmental functions when the circumstances do not line up with their conservative philosophy. it is imperative that we have nine members of the u.s. supreme court deciding constitutional issues that are important to the american people. the irony in all of this is that my republican friends constantly on this floor talk about strict construction of the constitution. a strict construction of the constitution, as mr. hoyer said a moment ago, requires the president to nominate an individual once there is a vacancy on the court. the senate, the united states senate, has the awesome responsibility of having a hearing, deciding, and confirming the nomination by an up-or-down vote. so it is absurd to suggest that president obama should be denied the opportunity to nominate a qualified justice to replace justice scalia. the american people should clearly understand that senate republicans have a political agenda to pack the court with conservative justices who would reverse years of commonsense progressive jurisprudence. so the congressional black caucus tonight demands senate republicans to stop the complete blockade and the blatant disrespect of our president. senate republicans' outright refusal to hold a hearing on any individual nominated by the president to serve on the court is an affront to our constitution and the american people. such divisive actions undermine our democracy and reduce our standing in the world. this blockade is an obstruction and runs afoul of the duties held by those who hold a seat in the august chamber of the united states senate. i have read that senator grassley, senator mcconnell, and others will meet with president obama this week. i hope they meet. i hope they sit together and reconcile their differences because this issue needs to be put to rest. we call on senate republicans to hold hearings once president obama submits his nomination and follow the procedures set forth in the constitution. in short and in closing, the congressional black caucus, the 45, 46 members of the congressional black caucus--and, indeed, the american people--have one message--one message--for senate republicans: do your job. don't play partisanship. don't play a partisan game with the supreme court of the united states of america. it is too serious. it is too important. thank you very much, mr. jeffries. mr. jeffries. i thank the distinguished chair for pointing out that this is a simple question for senate republicans: do your job consistent with your obligations and responsibilities under article ii, section 2 of the united states constitution. the senate republicans' failure to act or consider any nominee put forth by the president of the united states of america is an abdication of responsibility, a dereliction of duty, and it would be a stunning act of legislative malpractice that undermines the rule of law, the presidency, the supreme court, the united states constitution, as well as the american people. i am thankful now to be joined by someone who is a powerful voice for the voiceless here in the house of representatives, who has ably served her constituents in northern california and consistently fought for a fair, equitable society. let me now yield to my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from california, representative barbara lee. ms. lee. mr. speaker, let me thank the gentleman from new york for yielding, but also for his tremendous leadership. you and congresswoman joyce beatty from ohio really have sounded the alarm, beat the drum, and really brought to the american people the important issues that we are dealing with each and every day, so i just have to thank you for your diligence and for staying the course. every week you are here, you are representing not only this congress, but the country very, very well. so thank you. mr. speaker, i rise today with all my colleagues from the congressional black caucus, with our whip, mr. hoyer, and others to urge our republican colleagues in the senate to, of course, do your job. also, let me just remind us, once again, the president is trying to meet his constitutional obligation once again. he is trying to do what he is supposed to do, and that is to nominate justice scalia's replacement to our nation's highest court. and senate republicans have a constitutional responsibility to give the president's nominee a speedy and fair hearing, followed up with a simple up-or-down vote. sadly, these senate republicans said ``no'' to their constitutional responsibility. the supreme court has a huge responsibility of deciding cases that impact every aspect of american life, from our elections, college admissions, to scientific patents and a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions. it is imperative that the supreme court be allowed to function in its full capacity with nine justices. former supreme court justice sandra day o'connor, who was appointed by a conservative president, president ronald reagan, did not mince words in her condemnation of republicans playing politics with the court. she said: ``we need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it.'' former justice o'connor, i could not agree more. despite the calls for action and a constitutional mandate, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky has said that there will be no hearings, no votes, not even a meeting with president obama to discuss the late justice scalia's replacement. that is just wrong. his actions prompted the new york times to editorialize that he ``seems to have lost touch with reality and the constitution,'' speaking of majority leader mitch mcconnell. mr. speaker, i include in the record a couple of new york times articles. [from the new york times, feb. 17, 2016] blacks see bias in delay on a scalia successor (by maggie haberman and jonathan martin) charleston, sc.--as he left martha lou's kitchen, a soul food institution here on wednesday, edward gadsden expressed irritation about the republican determination to block president obama from selecting justice antonin scalia's replacement on the supreme court. ``they've been fighting that man since he's been there,'' mr. gadsden, who is african-american, said of mr. obama, before pointing at his forearm to explain what he said was driving the republican opposition: ``the color of his skin, that's all, the color of his skin.'' when senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader, said after mr. scalia's death on saturday that the next president, rather than mr. obama, should select a successor, the senator's words struck a familiar and painful chord with many black voters. after years of watching political opponents question the president's birthplace and his faith, and hearing a member of congress shout ``you lie!'' at him from the house floor, some african-americans saw the move by senate republicans as another attempt to deny the legitimacy of the country's first black president. and they call it increasingly infuriating after mr. obama has spent seven years in the white house and won two resounding election victories. ``our president, the president of the united states, has been disrespected from day 1,'' carol richardson, 61, said on wednesday as she colored a customer's hair at ultra beauty saloh in hollywood, s.c., a mostly black town near charleston. ``the words that have been said, the things the republicans have done they'd have never have done to another president. let's talk like it is, it's because of his skin color.'' [[page h1041]] reflecting on the supreme court vacancy, bakari sellers, a former state representative from denmark, s.c., likened the senate treatment of the president to the 18th century constitutional compromise that counted black men as equivalent to three-fifths of a person. ``i guess many of them are using this in the strictest construction that barack obama's serving three-fifths of a term or he's three-fifths of a human being, so he doesn't get to make this choice,'' mr. sellers said. ``it's infuriating.'' the anger and outrage that mr. mcconnell's position has touched off among african-americans could have implications for the presidential election. leading african-american democrats are trying to use it to motivate rank-and-file blacks to vote in november, the first presidential election in a decade in which mr. obama will not be on the ballot and in which democrats fear black participation could drop. ``anger becomes action when it's directly tied to a moment, and the moment now is the election on nov. 8,'' said stacey abrams, a democratic state representative from georgia and the house minority leader there, adding that mr. scalia's death meant that this presidential campaign could no longer be construed as a mere ``thought exercise.'' for hillary clinton, who is increasingly relying on nonwhite voters to ensure her success against senator bernie sanders of vermont, the court issue could be especially crucial. should she defeat mr. sanders, who has electrified many liberals, she will need a motivating issue to bring mr. obama's loyalists to the polls. she moved swiftly tuesday to tap into the anger of blacks over the opposition of senate republicans to mr. obama's naming a replacement for justice scalia. ``now the republicans say they'll reject anyone president obama nominates no matter how qualified,'' mrs. clinton said in remarks before a predominantly black audience in harlem. ``some are even saying he doesn't have the right to nominate anyone! as if somehow he's not the real president.'' doing so, mrs. clinton added, is in keeping with a longstanding pattern of mistreatment. ``they demonize president obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe,'' she said. ``this kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.'' republicans are especially sensitive about the notion that they are diminishing mr. obama because of his race, and spokesmen for several republican senators, including mr. mcconnell and senator tim scott of south carolina, declined to comment or would not make the senators available for comment. the suggestion that racism is playing a role angers mr. mcconnell's friends, who point out that his formative political experience was working for a republican senator who supported civil rights, that he helped override president ronald reagan's veto of sanctions against the apartheid government in south africa and that he is married to an asian-american woman. but in the aftermath of mr. mcconnell's statement on saturday, a growing chorus of black voices is complaining that such a refusal to even consider a supreme court nominee would never occur with a white president. ``it's more than a political motive--it has a smell of racism,'' said representative g. k. butterfield, democrat of north carolina, the chairman of the congressional black caucus. ``i can tick instance after instance over the last seven years where republicans have purposely tried to diminish the president's authority,'' mr. butterfield said. ``this is just really extreme, and leads me to the conclusion that if this was any other president who was not african-american, it would not have been handled this way.'' even as mr. obama's popularity has risen and fallen, his base of support among black voters has been unshakable. a gallup tracking poll this month showed that some 85 percent of african-americans approved of the president's performance compared with only 36 percent of whites. and many african- americans strongly identify personally with mr. obama, and have watched his tenure with pride. mr. butterfield said that he believed that the effort to undermine, and even delegitimize, mr. obama began soon after he was sworn in, and that congressional republicans had blocked mr. obama's agenda wherever they could. even more stinging were the suggestions from some on the right that mr. obama, a christian, is actually a muslim and that he was not born in the united states. in interviews, members of the congressional black caucus also bitterly recounted indignities, such as demands--most pointedly from the current republican front-runner in the polls, donald j. trump, in 2011--that mr. obama prove he was born in hawaii, and not in kenya, as some critics claimed. others recalled the calls to impeach mr. obama over his use of executive authority. ``you hear the thing about: `he's not a citizen. he oversteps his bounds. he's divisive.' one thing after another,'' said representative marcia l. fudge, democrat of ohio. ``this has been going on since the day he was elected in 2008.'' republicans have had more success than democrats in recent decades galvanizing their voters over who should control the courts. but jennifer mcclellan, a member of the virginia house of delegates and the democratic national committee, said the dispute over how to replace justice scalia could now become ``an issue for the average citizen.'' ms. abrams agreed, saying the supreme court and its powerful influence on people's lives is especially resonant with blacks. ``congress is denying our president his rights as a president, but, more than that, they're denying the legacy of his presidency,'' she said. ``that will animate democratic voters across the board but especially african- americans, who realize more than many voters how great an impact the supreme court can have on freedom.'' ____ [from the new york times, feb. 24, 2016] senate republicans lose their minds on a supreme court seat (by the editorial board) following the death of justice antonin scalia, senate republicans apparently believe they can profit by creating a political crisis that the nation has never seen before. on tuesday, the leadership doubled down on its refusal to take any action on any nominee from president obama to replace justice scalia. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader who seems to have lost touch with reality and the constitution, accused mr. obama of plunging the nation into a ``bitter and avoidable struggle'' should he name anyone to the court. forget an up-or-down vote on the senate floor. top republicans are pledging not to hold hearings or even to meet with a nominee. in a statement dripping with sarcasm, mr. mcconnell said that mr. obama ``has every right to nominate someone,'' and ``even if doing so will inevitably plunge our nation into another bitter and avoidable struggle, that is his right. even if he never expects that nominee to actually be confirmed but rather to wield as an electoral cudgel, that is his right.'' senator john cornyn of texas, the majority whip, said, ``we believe the american people need to decide who is going to make this appointment rather than a lame-duck president.'' these statements are so twisted that it's hard to know where to begin. let's take them one by one. first, mr. obama is not a ``lame-duck president.'' the lame-duck period is broadly understood to run from after the november election until a new president is inaugurated in january. november is more than eight months off. based on the average number of days it has taken the senate to act on previous supreme court nominees, the seat could be filled by this spring. second, no matter how often republicans repeat the phrase ``let the people decide,'' that's not how the system works. the constitution vests the power to make nominations to the court in the president, not ``the people.'' in any case, the people have already decided who should make this appointment: they elected mr. obama twice, by large margins. third, it is preposterous to accuse mr. obama of causing a ``bitter struggle'' by nominating someone who will not be confirmed. the only reason a nominee would not be confirmed is that the senate has pre-emptively decided to block any nominee sight unseen. mr. obama is once again the only adult in the room, carrying out his constitutional obligation while senate republicans scramble to dig up examples of democrats trying to block nominees. but those examples show only that democratic senators have pushed hard for republican presidents to pick ideologically moderate nominees. until now, neither party has ever vowed to shut down the nomination process entirely, even before it has begun. only two republican senators, mark kirk of illinois and susan collins of maine, were brave enough to say that they would vote on president obama's nominee. this is what passes for moderation in today's g.o.p.: simply stating a willingness to do the job you were elected to do. unfortunately, for too many republicans moderation now equals apostasy. these republicans have stubbornly parked themselves so far to the right for so many years that it is hard to tell whether they can hear how deranged they sound. the truth is they are afraid--and they should be. they know mr. obama has a large pool of extremely smart and thoroughly mainstream candidates from which to choose a nominee. they know that if the american people were allowed to hear such a person answer questions in a senate hearing, they would wonder what all the fuss was about. so mr. mcconnell and his colleagues plan to shut their doors, plug their ears and hope the public doesn't notice. the republican spin machine is working overtime to rationalize this behavior. don't be fooled. it is panic masquerading as strength. ms. lee. one of the titles of these articles is ``blacks see bias in delay on a scalia successor.'' the other is the new york times article, ``senate republicans lose their minds on a supreme court seat.'' likewise, judiciary committee chair charles grassley of iowa led a letter to the majority leader signed by all the republican committee members confirming their resolve to not have hearings or a vote on the nominee. [[page h1042]] this is downright ludicrous. republicans cannot and should not use the supreme court to push their radical political agenda. the constitution is clear, mr. speaker. article ii, section 2, ``he shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the senate . . . shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme court.'' nowhere in the constitution does it say, ``except in an election year'' or ``except when the president is a democrat'' or ``when republicans have spent the last 7 years actively working to subvert every policy proposed by a president elected by nearly 70 million americans.'' the constitution doesn't say that. this is simply unacceptable, and the american people deserve better. for more than a century, every single supreme court nominee has received a vote on the floor of the united states senate. just like all the presidents before him, president obama should nominate a supreme court justice, and the senate should determine if he or she is fit to serve on this nation's high court. instead, republicans are holding the supreme court and the american people hostage. their action, in the words of the new york times, is simply, ``panic masquerading as strength.'' the senate has a responsibility to at least consider the president's supreme court nominee, and by refusing to do so, they are failing their constituents and their nation. so, mr. speaker, it is really past time for majority leader mcconnell and the rest of the republican leadership to do their jobs and work together to get a new supreme court justice. the supreme court is way too important to be used as a political bargaining chip. enough is enough. so, once again, i join my colleagues, congressman jeffries, congresswoman beatty, members of the congressional black caucus, and the american people in saying, ``do your job.'' once again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join with you tonight. mr. jeffries. i thank the distinguished gentlewoman from california for making several important points as it relates to the absence of any partisanship exception in the united states constitution, the absence of any exception whereby the senate will do its job unless, of course, president barack obama happens to occupy 1600 pennsylvania avenue. i see that nowhere within the four corners of the united states constitution. i don't see an election year exception in the united states constitution. so i am perplexed as to what is the situation we find ourselves in right now. i thought that i may ask the distinguished gentlewoman, my colleague, my coanchor from ohio, to reflect upon, if you might, a few comments that could shed light on the situation we find ourselves in right now as it relates to the supreme court vacancy made by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell over the years during his time here in congress. in 1986, mitch mcconnell said: ``i believe that a heavy burden must be met by those who would have this nominee rejected. under the constitution, our duty is to provide advice and consent to judicial nominations, not to substitute our judgment for what are reasonable views for a judicial nominee to hold.'' that was in 1986. then in 1990, he said: ``it is clear under our form of government that the advice and consent role of the senate in judicial nominations should not be politicized.'' that was mitch mcconnell in 1990. in 2005, he said: ``our job is to react to that nomination in a respectful and dignified way, and at the end of the process, to give that person an up-or-down vote as all nominees who have majority support have gotten throughout the history of the country.'' i am trying to figure out what has changed, representative beatty. mrs. beatty. thank you so much, congressman jeffries. hearing you quote those things, three things come to mind. first, let me say that congressman steny hoyer was absolutely right when he says that this issue of not filling the vacancy is not related to only one group. so i want to say, after hearing what you said and many others of our members of the congressional black caucus, it is important for us to know why we are calling on the senate republicans to do their job, and that is because we are the voice for those who are not often represented. we are the voice for those when you talk about issues related to women and women's rights, when you talk about issues that are related to things that affect you and me, and when you talk about the article that congresswoman barbara lee entered into the record, ``blacks see bias in delay on a scalia successor.'' now, that article says it all. that article specifically states that many folks believe, in this wonderful america that we live in, that it is also because of the color of his skin. i think that is another reason that we come as a strong 46 members of the congressional black caucus, because the facts work against them. think about it. when we look at the number of people who have been appointed, when we look at the number of days, if you look at since 1975, it has only taken an average of 67 days to confirm a president's nominee to the supreme court. the senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a supreme court nominee, and there are 325 days left in president obama's term. {time} 2000 since the early 1900s, six supreme court justices have been confirmed in an election year. when i think about your question and i think about your sharing with us some of the comments that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said, let me add this one to the record. and it is something he got right. he said that the american people should have the right to choose the president who will pick the next supreme court justice deciding the future balance of the nation's highest court. well, he got that right. because you know what. the people did pick the president when they picked president barack obama in 2012, who won the election by 5 million votes. i am calling on him and the senate republicans to do their job, to allow the president to do what the constitution tells us, to allow the president, who has already said that he is going to bring somebody who is full of scholarship, he is going to bring someone who is committed and capable to doing the people's work--i wanted to add that to your statement and share with everyone tonight that is why we are here. mr. jeffries. i really appreciate that. as we are simply trying to point out, all we are asking for is for the senate to adhere to its constitutional responsibilities and, when the president sends forth a nominee, to conduct a rigorous hearing process before the american people and then, at the end of that process, provide that nominee with an up-or-down vote before the judiciary committee and then, ultimately, the floor of the united states senate. now, i have been in this institution for a little over 3 years. if i had a dollar for every time some of my colleagues mentioned strict adherence to the united states constitution, i would be a billionaire right now. for the life of me, i can't understand what is so complicated about this particular issue. as representative beatty so ably pointed out, from this moment, there are 325 days remaining in the presidency of barack obama. as this chart illustrates, if you just take a look at the current occupants of the supreme court, justice roberts, the chief justice, the most important position on the supreme court, a 23-day confirmation process; justice scalia, confirmed in 85 days; justice kagan, 87 days; justice sotomayor, 66 days; justice ruth bader ginsburg, a/k/a the notorious rbg--one of my personal favorites--50 days; justice clarence thomas, 99 days. you can add some of these confirmation periods together and you still wouldn't get to 325. so what is the problem? mr. speaker, how much time do i have remaining on my special order today? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new york has 12 minutes remaining. [[page h1043]] general leave mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? there was no objection. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, one of the concerns that i think we in the congressional black caucus have as it relates to the presidency of president obama--and representative beatty pointed this out--is that there is a feeling in many corners of america that this president is treated differently. i am not sure if it is because there are some people here in the capitol who have something against folks from hawaii. i am not sure if it is his kansas roots. i don't know if they dislike the fact that he was a community organizer in terms of one of the jobs that he held after school. i don't know if they dislike the fact that he is so well educated from columbia and harvard law schools. i don't know if it is the fact that he was the president of the harvard law review or a constitutional law professor at the university of chicago law school, one of the top five law schools in this country. i don't really know what it is about barack obama that they want to treat him differently than almost any other president who has served at 1600 pennsylvania avenue. i am trying to figure it out. what is it about barack obama that he has to be treated with such disrespect? the amazing thing to me is that they have actually failed to stop this president. they gave him no assistance as it relates to trying to turn the economy around. he inherited a train wreck from george w. bush and has gotten the economy back on track. not a single member from the other side of the aisle voted for the stimulus package, which was necessary to stabilize the economy and then build it up. there was 71 consecutive months of private sector job creation, and 14 million-plus private sector jobs were created under this presidency. the unemployment rate has gone from over 10 percent to under 5 percent. the stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. the deficit has been reduced by more than $1 trillion. gas prices are below $2 per gallon. more than 18 million previously uninsured americans now have health coverage. not a single one of those accomplishments occurred with a vote from the other side of the aisle. what is it about this president that they don't like? now, in his final term--and, by the way, speaking to strict constructionists--when you look at the united states constitution, i can't find a 3-year term. i can't find it. it is a 4-year term with 325 days left. all we are asking is that they just do their job. it is pretty simple. give whoever the president puts forth a fair hearing. they have the votes to defeat any of his nominees. let me ask my colleague from ohio. what i haven't been able to understand is this justice who i have disagreed with on many issues. although he was strong--justice scalia--on the privacy rights of the american people, the fourth amendment--was concerned about the criminalization of politics, these are areas where there is some common ground. and certainly he was a giant in terms of legal thought. the news of his demise was barely out for public consumption when mitch mcconnell issued a statement saying: we are not considering anyone that president obama puts forth. how do you explain that? how do you interpret that reaction? we couldn't even respect the death of justice scalia before the vacancy was politicized, before he was even buried and funeralized. mrs. beatty. congressman jeffries, i think you answered that question for me when you gave the long list of successes that this president has done without their help. that gave me pause to think: what is it that is keeping them from doing their job? why is it that they are so threatened? maybe it is the success that this president has brought forth not for you and i, not for the 435 members of us, but he has done this for this nation. he has made it a better place. when we look at what the justices do and represent, when we think about liberties and freedoms and the economy and our rights, i think they are afraid that he will appoint someone who will have that same scholarship, who will have that same success, someone who will bring balance. i think they are afraid of the balance. in the words of another one of our colleagues, i might add, from the great state of ohio, congresswoman marcia fudge, former chair of the congressional black caucus--she has words that she is entering, but i would like to quote from her words to remind us why we are saying: senate republicans, do your job. she reminds us, as members of congress, we made a promise to our constituents that we would faithfully discharge the duties and the oath of office which we took, which we were elected to. she reminded me in her words that it is so important for us to say tonight to the senate: do your job. do your job. i think they are afraid. so i am going to issue a challenge. congresswoman barbara lee said that you are here tonight initiating this topic because we are sounding the alarm, we are ringing the bell. i challenge them to answer that question. i challenge them to share with not only the congressional black caucus, not only the members of congress, not only the members of the senate, but they have an obligation to america, to the citizens of these united states, mr. speaker, for them to tell us why they are not doing their job. mr. jeffries. i thank the distinguished gentlewoman for those very powerful words. i can only hope, as we close this special order hour, that our colleagues from across this capitol will see fit simply to adhere to their constitutional responsibilities to consider any nominee put forth by president obama comprehensively and fairly and to faithfully execute those obligations consistent with their oath of office, not for the good of this president, not for the good of this article i congress, but for the good of the united states of america. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",55323

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1063-6,CREC-2016-02-29,114,PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1063-S1064] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there is an epidemic sweeping across our Nation, ripping through communities, tearing families apart, striking at the vulnerable--even babies who have yet to take their first breath. The prescription opioid and heroin epidemic does not discriminate by demographic or socioeconomic status, by age or by gender. It touches parents and children, neighbors and coworkers in all 50 States. It is ending lives at recordbreaking rates, and it is getting worse. Deaths from opioids have surged by 200 percent over the last decade and a half alone. In my home State of Kentucky, drug overdoses continue to outpace the number of fatalities from traffic accidents. This is an issue we have been combating for some time, and we have made some important strides along the way, but there is a lot more to do. This week we have an opportunity to take an important step forward. One of the most painful aspects of this epidemic, as I mentioned, is the increasing number of infants who are born dependent on opioids such as prescription pain killers and heroin. These children start their lives suffering from drug dependence, which is nearly as hard to imagine as it is heartbreaking. Last year, I sponsored a bipartisan measure designed to help address this specific issue. I appreciate the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, for working across the aisle with me to advance the Protecting Our Infants Act through Congress, and I am proud to say it was signed into law just a few months ago. It is an example of one of the many steps we have already begun to take as we address this epidemic. We took another step forward last week when the Senate voted to confirm a new FDA Commissioner. I have been very clear that the FDA must take a stronger approach in regard to this epidemic and its prevention efforts, which is why I appreciated Dr. Califf's expressed vision for positive change at the agency. I voted for his nomination last week, but as I told him, he should know that we will continue to ensure oversight over his agency's response going forward. This week, we have another opportunity to take a step forward--an important step forward. Before us today is bipartisan legislation that would help combat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic at every level. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, is the product of a lot of hard work and bipartisan work by a number of Senators. I would like to recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from Iowa, and the ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, for acting swiftly to pass this bill through committee on a voice vote. I appreciate the assistance and cooperation of other leaders on this important issue, such as the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the ranking member from the State of Washington. I also want to thank the sponsors of this bill, the junior Senators from Ohio, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, and the senior Senator from Minnesota. These leaders understand the toll this epidemic is taking on our communities. They have studied the issue closely in their home States, and [[Page S1064]] they have worked with Senators from across the aisle to advance this legislation through the legislative process. It is thanks to their hard work that we are debating this bipartisan bill today. The junior Senator from Ohio has called CARA the only bipartisan legislation that includes a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to help communities combat this epidemic. It would strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs, it would improve treatment initiatives, it would expand prevention and education, and it would give law enforcement more of the tools it needs to fight back against this epidemic. It is no wonder this bipartisan legislation is supported by more than 130 national anti-drug groups. In a recent letter, they noted the only way to ``stop and reverse current trends'' was with a comprehensive approach, such as that included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, that leverages evidence-based law enforcement and health care services, including treatment. So this bill takes the kind of comprehensive approach that is needed and at the same time, as these groups also noted in their letter, ``the cost of the bill is kept low'' with ``no impact on mandatory spending.'' I ask colleagues to join with us in working to pass this bipartisan authorization bill. We will also have opportunities through the appropriations process this spring to continue important funding, just as we did last year. Indeed, just a few months ago we appropriated $400 million to opioid-specific programs--nearly one-third more than what the Senate appropriated the preceding year--and we understand that all $400 million of those funds still remains available to be spent today. That is right. All $400 million remains available to be spent. I sincerely hope our friends across the aisle will join us in supporting this legislation to address our national crisis. This is an important bill for each of us in this Chamber, and I look forward to taking action today to get us closer to seeing it become law. I have talked about the urgency and the multifaceted complexity associated with this epidemic, and I want to underline the hard work being done in the Senate to address it. The chairs of the Judiciary Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, whom I recognized earlier, have been looking at ways to both improve law enforcement tools and increase education and awareness respectively. The chair of the Committee on Finance has, as his committee explored in a hearing last week, been focused on how this issue affects our child welfare system. And of course, we again recognize the cooperation of Members of both parties-- chairs and ranking members and a bipartisan list of sponsors on both sides of the aisle. Working together across the aisle--with State and local governments, agencies and law enforcement--we can help end this crisis once and for all. I look forward to taking the next step toward that objective later today. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1063-S1064] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE Mr. McCONNELL.

They have studied the issue closely in their home States, and [[Page S1064]] they have worked with Senators from across the aisle to advance this legislation through the legislative process. It is thanks to their hard work that we are debating this bipartisan bill today. The junior Senator from Ohio has called CARA the only bipartisan legislation that includes a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to help communities combat this epidemic. It would strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs, it would improve treatment initiatives, it would expand prevention and education, and it would give law enforcement more of the tools it needs to fight back against this epidemic. It is no wonder this bipartisan legislation is supported by more than 130 national anti-drug groups. In a recent letter, they noted the only way to ``stop and reverse current trends'' was with a comprehensive approach, such as that included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, that leverages evidence-based law enforcement and health care services, including treatment. So this bill takes the kind of comprehensive approach that is needed and at the same time, as these groups also noted in their letter, ``the cost of the bill is kept low'' with ``no impact on mandatory spending.'' I ask colleagues to join with us in working to pass this bipartisan authorization bill. We will also have opportunities through the appropriations process this spring to continue important funding, just as we did last year. Indeed, just a few months ago we appropriated $400 million to opioid-specific programs--nearly one-third more than what the Senate appropriated the preceding year--and we understand that all $400 million of those funds still remains available to be spent today. That is right. All $400 million remains available to be spent. I sincerely hope our friends across the aisle will join us in supporting this legislation to address our national crisis. This is an important bill for each of us in this Chamber, and I look forward to taking action today to get us closer to seeing it become law. I have talked about the urgency and the multifaceted complexity associated with this epidemic, and I want to underline the hard work being done in the Senate to address it. The chairs of the Judiciary Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, whom I recognized earlier, have been looking at ways to both improve law enforcement tools and increase education and awareness respectively. The chair of the Committee on Finance has, as his committee explored in a hearing last week, been focused on how this issue affects our child welfare system. And of course, we again recognize the cooperation of Members of both parties-- chairs and ranking members and a bipartisan list of sponsors on both sides of the aisle. Working together across the aisle--with State and local governments, agencies and law enforcement--we can help end this crisis once and for all. I look forward to taking the next step toward that objective later today. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,6398,6398,6468,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1063-s1064] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] prescription drug abuse mr. mcconnell. madam president, there is an epidemic sweeping across our nation, ripping through communities, tearing families apart, striking at the vulnerable--even babies who have yet to take their first breath. the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic does not discriminate by demographic or socioeconomic status, by age or by gender. it touches parents and children, neighbors and coworkers in all 50 states. it is ending lives at recordbreaking rates, and it is getting worse. deaths from opioids have surged by 200 percent over the last decade and a half alone. in my home state of kentucky, drug overdoses continue to outpace the number of fatalities from traffic accidents. this is an issue we have been combating for some time, and we have made some important strides along the way, but there is a lot more to do. this week we have an opportunity to take an important step forward. one of the most painful aspects of this epidemic, as i mentioned, is the increasing number of infants who are born dependent on opioids such as prescription pain killers and heroin. these children start their lives suffering from drug dependence, which is nearly as hard to imagine as it is heartbreaking. last year, i sponsored a bipartisan measure designed to help address this specific issue. i appreciate the senior senator from pennsylvania, mr. casey, for working across the aisle with me to advance the protecting our infants act through congress, and i am proud to say it was signed into law just a few months ago. it is an example of one of the many steps we have already begun to take as we address this epidemic. we took another step forward last week when the senate voted to confirm a new fda commissioner. i have been very clear that the fda must take a stronger approach in regard to this epidemic and its prevention efforts, which is why i appreciated dr. califf's expressed vision for positive change at the agency. i voted for his nomination last week, but as i told him, he should know that we will continue to ensure oversight over his agency's response going forward. this week, we have another opportunity to take a step forward--an important step forward. before us today is bipartisan legislation that would help combat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic at every level. the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, or cara, is the product of a lot of hard work and bipartisan work by a number of senators. i would like to recognize the chairman of the judiciary committee, the senator from iowa, and the ranking member, the senator from vermont, for acting swiftly to pass this bill through committee on a voice vote. i appreciate the assistance and cooperation of other leaders on this important issue, such as the chairman of the committee on health, education, labor, and pensions and the ranking member from the state of washington. i also want to thank the sponsors of this bill, the junior senators from ohio, new hampshire, and rhode island, and the senior senator from minnesota. these leaders understand the toll this epidemic is taking on our communities. they have studied the issue closely in their home states, and [[page s1064]] they have worked with senators

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1064-2,CREC-2016-02-29,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1064-S1065] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID. Madam President, ``History won't forget this misstep by Grassley,'' this poster says. ``History won't forget this misstep by Grassley.'' That is from the Burlington Hawk Eye, Iowa's oldest newspaper. That is what they said. It is the headline from the oldest newspaper, as I indicated--the Burlington Hawk Eye. The misstep referenced here is the unprecedented statement by the senior Senator from Iowa and the Republican leader to deny the President the right to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy. The article ends with this declaration: A few weeks back, when the longest-tenured U.S. Senator from Iowa passed a vote that gave him the record of most consecutive votes in the Senate, we lauded his service to us. We noted in casting votes on matters before the Senate, he was doing what Iowans elected him to do. We gave Grassley an attaboy for that. We take it back. ``We take it back.'' That is a blistering statement, a revealing statement, a substantive statement. ``We take it back.'' There is a lesson that Senator Grassley and my Republican colleagues should learn from this editorial. By refusing to give President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a meeting, a hearing or a vote, they are abandoning the oath of office they swore when they became Senators. This abdication of their constitutional responsibilities will epitomize their work as Senators. Whatever they may have accomplished during their careers will be secondary to their decision to place electoral politics over their job. Remember that our job here is to vote. That is what we swore to do-- to follow the Constitution. And the Constitution couldn't be clearer on this issue. So the stakes should even be higher for Senator Grassley and the other Republican Senators. Why? Because as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley presides over one of the most important and prestigious committees in the entire Senate. This has been the case for 200 years--200 years. The Senate Judiciary Committee was established 200 years ago. In 1816, it was one of the original 11 standing committees. Twenty decades have passed. That is how long the committee has been in operation. Throughout history, Judiciary Committee chairs have traditionally wielded immense power--from President Martin Van Buren, when he was in the Senate, to Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator Arlen Specter, and Senator Joe Biden. Judiciary Committee chairmen have historically prized their independence and guarded it at all costs from being manhandled for partisan purposes. It was so independent, in fact, that past chairmen have stood firm in the face of opposition from Presidents and Senate leadership. At crucial times in American history, the Senate and the Nation have looked to the Judiciary Committee to do the right thing. During the Civil War, Chairman Lyman Trumbull of Illinois and his committee authored the Thirteenth Amendment. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery during the Civil War. We know that during that period of time there was great consternation as to what should be done. Even the great President Lincoln had trouble deciding what should be done during the early days of the Civil War. In 1889, Chairman George Hoar of Massachusetts and his committee drafted the Sherman Antitrust Act, refusing to give in to the special interests of Carnegie, Vanderbilt, and the Rockefeller monopolies. That was big-time independence. In 1937, Chairman Henry Ashurst from Arizona, who was born in Winnemucca, NV, led his committee in standing firm against President Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court. Chairman Ashurst was a Democrat, just like President Roosevelt. Yet Ashurst and his committee maintained their independence, even against the wishes of Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley, a longtime Senator who became Vice President later. Imagine that. He was the Senate majority leader. He was from Kentucky. Imagine that Judiciary Committee chair standing up to a majority leader from Kentucky. The accomplishments of these powerful chairmen and many others are the historic models against which the senior Senator from Iowa will be measured. If he keeps his current obstruction, history will not be kind to his tenure as chairman of the committee. As of today, the chairman has yielded his committee's long-held authority and independence to the Republican leader for the sole purpose of weakening President Obama, of weakening the Presidency of the United States, and obstructing the Senate's work. The chairman has turned the impartial reputation of the Judiciary Committee into an extension of the Trump campaign. Just last month Chairman Grassley spoke at a rally for Donald Trump in Iowa. At that rally, the chairman said: We've had this trend going this way, away from the basic principles that established our government. And so we have an opportunity, once again, to make America great again. [[Page S1065]] Before I close, let's remember what he said: ``We've had this trend going this way, away from the basic principles that established our government.'' My friend from Iowa would do well to look at his own committee as it trends away from--again, the quote, ``away from the basic principles that established our government.'' That is what the Senator from Iowa said at the Trump rally. Even now, he and his committee are wasting millions in taxpayer dollars developing partisan opposition research on Secretary Clinton. It has been going on for many months, more than a year, including asking for maternity leave records for staffers and time sheets from her office--just basic staff people. For months, Senator Grassley blocked the confirmation of vital State Department officials, even career Foreign Service officers who are here, so we could give them a raise after their valiant service all around the world. He held that up, and people couldn't understand it. It had nothing to do with Secretary Clinton. He did it as a way to weaken the Presidency of President Obama. What he has done is damage U.S. diplomacy worldwide. Election day is more than 8 months away, but it is affecting nearly every action taken by the Grassley Judiciary Committee. There is much more at stake than Senator Grassley's reputation. When the committee's independence is threatened by partisan politics, the future of this institution hangs in the balance, and when the Senate is undermined, our democracy is undermined. Future generations will suffer irreparably if the Senator from Iowa continues to do the bidding of the Republican leader and the Donald Trumps of the new Republican Party. Senator Grassley and I have worked together for three decades. I served a couple terms in the House. Then I came here. My seat was way back there. When I gave my maiden speech, my first speech, I talked about the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, an idea I had in the House and I couldn't get past first base. Presiding in the Senate that day was Senator David Pryor from Arkansas, who was chairman of the subcommittee on the Internal Revenue Service. Senator Grassley was also listening. They both contacted me. In fact, I received a note from Senator Pryor and a call from Senator Grassley saying: I like that legislation. I will work to help you. And they did, and we got that passed. So I have nothing personal against Senator Grassley. I like him. He helped me pass something that was landmark legislation as a brandnew freshman Senator, but today, as a U.S. Senator, I have a duty to speak when the Republican Senate refuses to follow its constitutional obligations to provide advice and consent on the President's Supreme Court nomination. As a Senator, I have a duty to demand that the Judiciary Committee considers important judicial nominees, especially--especially--someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. As Senate Judiciary chair, the senior Senator from Iowa has a job to do. I repeat, my criticism is not personal. It is professional and it is substantive. The senior Senator from Iowa outlined that job himself when he assumed the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee. When he took over as chairman, he promised Republicans would ``restore the Senate to the deliberative body that the founders intended.'' Listen to that. That is what he said, to ``restore the Senate to the deliberative body that the founders intended.'' That is a quote. Another quote. He said he took the responsibility of ``vetting of nominees for lifetime appointments to the federal judiciary very seriously.'' The senior Senator from Iowa is failing this commitment that he made to himself. He made it. He made the commitment to ``restore the Senate to the deliberative body that the founders intended.'' The Founders are the people who wrote the Constitution. He is the first chair of this important committee to take the unprecedented step of refusing to meet, conduct hearings or hold a vote on a Supreme Court nomination. He is following the Republican leader's call to refuse the President's nominee a meeting, a hearing or a vote. The senior Senator from Iowa, of all people, should know how important a vote is. My friend has a lot of rollcall votes, 7,545 consecutive votes as of today, but what good are 7,500 consecutive votes if you simply sweep the votes you don't like to take under the rug? It taints this achievement. If he doesn't like President Obama's nominee, then he doesn't have to vote for the nominee, but don't run from a hard vote. Don't hide. What good is a chairmanship if it is just a rubberstamp for partisan politics? What good is a chairmanship if it is used to weaken the Senate and disrupt our Constitution's system of checks and balances? And that is what it does. Last week the Des Moines Register published an open letter from one of Senator Grassley's former employees. It was stunning. He worked in the Senate. This man's words capture what is at stake: The institution of the Senate has managed to perform its constitutional obligations for well over 200 years. Every single nominee for the Supreme Court that has not withdrawn from consideration has received a vote within 125 days. Today, I feel nothing but shame for the fact that my senator, my former friend, will be bringing that unbroken history to an end. That was the headline last week in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper. I hope the chairman of the Judiciary Committee doesn't continue down this path. It will not benefit him, his committee, the Senate, the State of Iowa or this great country. Instead, he should follow the examples of his predecessors and give President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. He simply should do his job. If he doesn't, history will never forget this unprecedented misstep. History will never forget this misstep by Senator Grassley. I yield the floor. Madam President, I ask the Chair to announce the business for the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1064-S1065] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID.

Today, I feel nothing but shame for the fact that my senator, my former friend, will be bringing that unbroken history to an end. That was the headline last week in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper. I hope the chairman of the Judiciary Committee doesn't continue down this path. It will not benefit him, his committee, the Senate, the State of Iowa or this great country. Instead, he should follow the examples of his predecessors and give President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. He simply should do his job. If he doesn't, history will never forget this unprecedented misstep. History will never forget this misstep by Senator Grassley. I yield the floor. Madam President, I ask the Chair to announce the business for the day. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1064-S1065] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID. Madam President, ``History won't forget this misstep by Grassley,'' this poster says. ``History won't forget this misstep by Grassley.'' That is from the Burlington Hawk Eye, Iowa's oldest newspaper. That is what they said. It is the headline from the oldest newspaper, as I indicated--the Burlington Hawk Eye. The misstep referenced here is the unprecedented statement by the senior Senator from Iowa and the Republican leader to deny the President the right to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy. The article ends with this declaration: A few weeks back, when the longest-tenured U.S. Senator from Iowa passed a vote that gave him the record of most consecutive votes in the Senate, we lauded his service to us. We noted in casting votes on matters before the Senate, he was doing what Iowans elected him to do. We gave Grassley an attaboy for that. We take it back. ``We take it back.'' That is a blistering statement, a revealing statement, a substantive statement. ``We take it back.'' There is a lesson that Senator Grassley and my Republican colleagues should learn from this editorial. By refusing to give President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a meeting, a hearing or a vote, they are abandoning the oath of office they swore when they became Senators. This abdication of their constitutional responsibilities will epitomize their work as Senators. Whatever they may have accomplished during their careers will be secondary to their decision to place electoral politics over their job. Remember that our job here is to vote. That is what we swore to do-- to follow the Constitution. And the Constitution couldn't be clearer on this issue. So the stakes should even be higher for Senator Grassley and the other Republican Senators. Why? Because as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley presides over one of the most important and prestigious committees in the entire Senate. This has been the case for 200 years--200 years. The Senate Judiciary Committee was established 200 years ago. In 1816, it was one of the original 11 standing committees. Twenty decades have passed. That is how long the committee has been in operation. Throughout history, Judiciary Committee chairs have traditionally wielded immense power--from President Martin Van Buren, when he was in the Senate, to Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator Arlen Specter, and Senator Joe Biden. Judiciary Committee chairmen have historically prized their independence and guarded it at all costs from being manhandled for partisan purposes. It was so independent, in fact, that past chairmen have stood firm in the face of opposition from Presidents and Senate leadership. At crucial times in American history, the Senate and the Nation have looked to the Judiciary Committee to do the right thing. During the Civil War, Chairman Lyman Trumbull of Illinois and his committee authored the Thirteenth Amendment. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery during the Civil War. We know that during that period of time there was great consternation as to what should be done. Even the great President Lincoln had trouble deciding what should be done during the early days of the Civil War. In 1889, Chairman George Hoar of Massachusetts and his committee drafted the Sherman Antitrust Act, refusing to give in to the special interests of Carnegie, Vanderbilt, and the Rockefeller monopolies. That was big-time independence. In 1937, Chairman Henry Ashurst from Arizona, who was born in Winnemucca, NV, led his committee in standing firm against President Franklin D. Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court. Chairman Ashurst was a Democrat, just like President Roosevelt. Yet Ashurst and his committee maintained their independence, even against the wishes of Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley, a longtime Senator who became Vice President later. Imagine that. He was the Senate majority leader. He was from Kentucky. Imagine that Judiciary Committee chair standing up to a majority leader from Kentucky. The accomplishments of these powerful chairmen and many others are the historic models against which the senior Senator from Iowa will be measured. If he keeps his current obstruction, history will not be kind to his tenure as chairman of the committee. As of today, the chairman has yielded his committee's long-held authority and independence to the Republican leader for the sole purpose of weakening President Obama, of weakening the Presidency of the United States, and obstructing the Senate's work. The chairman has turned the impartial reputation of the Judiciary Committee into an extension of the Trump campaign. Just last month Chairman Grassley spoke at a rally for Donald Trump in Iowa. At that rally, the chairman said: We've had this trend going this way, away from the basic principles that established our government. And so we have an opportunity, once again, to make America great again. [[Page S1065]] Before I close, let's remember what he said: ``We've had this trend going this way, away from the basic principles that established our government.'' My friend from Iowa would do well to look at his own committee as it trends away from--again, the quote, ``away from the basic principles that established our government.'' That is what the Senator from Iowa said at the Trump rally. Even now, he and his committee are wasting millions in taxpayer dollars developing partisan opposition research on Secretary Clinton. It has been going on for many months, more than a year, including asking for maternity leave records for staffers and time sheets from her office--just basic staff people. For months, Senator Grassley blocked the confirmation of vital State Department officials, even career Foreign Service officers who are here, so we could give them a raise after their valiant service all around the world. He held that up, and people couldn't understand it. It had nothing to do with Secretary Clinton. He did it as a way to weaken the Presidency of President Obama. What he has done is damage U.S. diplomacy worldwide. Election day is more than 8 months away, but it is affecting nearly every action taken by the Grassley Judiciary Committee. There is much more at stake than Senator Grassley's reputation. When the committee's independence is threatened by partisan politics, the future of this institution hangs in the balance, and when the Senate is undermined, our democracy is undermined. Future generations will suffer irreparably if the Senator from Iowa continues to do the bidding of the Republican leader and the Donald Trumps of the new Republican Party. Senator Grassley and I have worked together for three decades. I served a couple terms in the House. Then I came here. My seat was way back there. When I gave my maiden speech, my first speech, I talked about the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, an idea I had in the House and I couldn't get past first base. Presiding in the Senate that day was Senator David Pryor from Arkansas, who was chairman of the subcommittee on the Internal Revenue Service. Senator Grassley was also listening. They both contacted me. In fact, I received a note from Senator Pryor and a call from Senator Grassley saying: I like that legislation. I will work to help you. And they did, and we got that passed. So I have nothing personal against Senator Grassley. I like him. He helped me pass something that was landmark legislation as a brandnew freshman Senator, but today, as a U.S. Senator, I have a duty to speak when the Republican Senate refuses to follow its constitutional obligations to provide advice and consent on the President's Supreme Court nomination. As a Senator, I have a duty to demand that the Judiciary Committee considers important judicial nominees, especially--especially--someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. As Senate Judiciary chair, the senior Senator from Iowa has a job to do. I repeat, my criticism is not personal. It is professional and it is substantive. The senior Senator from Iowa outlined that job himself when he assumed the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee. When he took over as chairman, he promised Republicans would ``restore the Senate to the deliberative body that the founders intended.'' Listen to that. That is what he said, to ``restore the Senate to the deliberative body that the founders intended.'' That is a quote. Another quote. He said he took the responsibility of ``vetting of nominees for lifetime appointments to the federal judiciary very seriously.'' The senior Senator from Iowa is failing this commitment that he made to himself. He made it. He made the commitment to ``restore the Senate to the deliberative body that the founders intended.'' The Founders are the people who wrote the Constitution. He is the first chair of this important committee to take the unprecedented step of refusing to meet, conduct hearings or hold a vote on a Supreme Court nomination. He is following the Republican leader's call to refuse the President's nominee a meeting, a hearing or a vote. The senior Senator from Iowa, of all people, should know how important a vote is. My friend has a lot of rollcall votes, 7,545 consecutive votes as of today, but what good are 7,500 consecutive votes if you simply sweep the votes you don't like to take under the rug? It taints this achievement. If he doesn't like President Obama's nominee, then he doesn't have to vote for the nominee, but don't run from a hard vote. Don't hide. What good is a chairmanship if it is just a rubberstamp for partisan politics? What good is a chairmanship if it is used to weaken the Senate and disrupt our Constitution's system of checks and balances? And that is what it does. Last week the Des Moines Register published an open letter from one of Senator Grassley's former employees. It was stunning. He worked in the Senate. This man's words capture what is at stake: The institution of the Senate has managed to perform its constitutional obligations for well over 200 years. Every single nominee for the Supreme Court that has not withdrawn from consideration has received a vote within 125 days. Today, I feel nothing but shame for the fact that my senator, my former friend, will be bringing that unbroken history to an end.

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1069,CREC-2016-02-29,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1069-S1071] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. BROWN. Madam President, in the last 2 minutes I would like to say a few more words about the Supreme Court vacancy. Four former U.S. attorneys from Ohio, Washington State, California, and Virginia published an op-ed that went around the country urging the Senate to promptly consider a Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice Scalia. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the writings of the former U.S. attorneys. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Steve Dettelbach, Jenny Durkan, Melinda Haag and Tim Heaphy are Democratic former U.S. attorneys for, respectively, Northern Ohio, Western Washington, Northern California and Western Virginia. As former U.S. attorneys in diverse districts that are home to more than 20 million Americans, we urge that the president promptly nominate, and the Senate promptly consider, a Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia. Both the plain language of the Constitution and plain truths regarding public safety and national security demand that result. For federal prosecutors, agents and criminal investigations, a year is a lifetime. We have seen real threats, whether it is the heroin epidemic or the threat of ISIS recruitment, facing the people in our communities each day. While law enforcement stands ready to protect the public from those threats, they need to know the rules of the road. Uncertainty about those rules impedes their efforts. Just as with the economy, uncertainty prevents good agents and prosecutors from deciding on investigative strategies and tactics, and making important charging decisions. The Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the hardest and most important questions facing law enforcement and our nation. [[Page S1070]] Even as we write today, unsettled legal questions regarding search and seizure, digital privacy and federal sentencing are either pending before the Supreme Court or headed there. It is unfair and unsafe to expect good federal agents, police and prosecutors to spend more than a year guessing whether their actions will hold up in court. And it is just as unfair to expect citizens whose rights and liberties are at stake to wait for answers while their homes, emails, cell phones, records and activities are investigated. Equally important, as lawyers and former public officials committed to the Constitution and the rule of law, it is incredible to us that anyone who claims fidelity to those ideas can argue that either the president or the Senate should not fulfill their duties. And we should be clear on what those duties are. Announcing ahead of time that the Senate will reject any nominee, or refusing to hold fair hearings, does not fulfill the Senate's duty to provide ``advice and consent'' on court nominees. The ``advice'' called for in the Constitution does not include, ``Just forget it, Mr. President.'' It is ironic that the arguments being made by those urging a year-plus delay are precisely the types of arguments that Scalia abhorred. They are based on politics and some vague notions of Senate ``interpretations'' of the Constitution. As U.S. attorneys we were constantly assessing the strength of constitutional and other legal arguments. And there was no more demanding jurist than Scalia when it came to supporting those arguments with written law. One argument is based on the ``Thurmond rule,'' named for the former senator from South Carolina, which calls for no confirmations in the final months of a president's term. But this ``rule'' has never been applied to the Supreme Court and it finds no home in the text of the Constitution. We would all have bought tickets to see Scalia question a lawyer who dared to raise an argument like that. Few things in the Constitution seem as unambiguous as term length. The president is elected for four years under Article II. There is no clause diminishing the president's duties in the last year, and as even Jeb Bush acknowledged, such notions are dangerous. Should the president stop fighting ISIS in his last year? Should senators facing an election year not be allowed to vote on judicial nominees so that the ``people can decide?'' Certainly not. The people already did decide what would happen from January 2013 to January 2017. They elected President Obama. In both our communities and court system, we don't have more than a year to blithely waste for political reasons. The safety concerns and dangers are pressing, and our leaders in the White House and the Senate do not have built-in vacation time on our dime. Mr. BROWN. I close just begging, urging, imploring, and beseeching my colleagues on the Republican side to move forward on the Supreme Court nominee. We have not had a Supreme Court vacancy for as long as a year since the Civil War because we were at war in the 1860s. The average nomination process for confirming a Supreme Court nominee when there are 8 members of the Supreme Court is only about 6 weeks. The longest, Justice Thomas, took 99 days. The President of the United States is elected for 4 years--not a 3-year term. A 4-year term has 300-plus days in the term. This Senator is disappointed--I will leave it at that--to hear that my colleagues have said there will not be hearings. Then they said that not only will there not be hearings for the President's nomination, they will not even meet with a nominee. This Senator finds it rather shameful for an institution with this kind of heritage and this kind of reputation that we don't do better than that. I urge my colleagues to do our jobs, do what we were elected to do, what we were sworn in to do, and do what we are paid to do to bring this nominee--vote against them if you like but bring up this nominee for real Senate consideration. I yield the floor, and I thank Senator Grassley for allowing me more time. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, Madam President, it is another day and another tantrum from the minority leader, but it doesn't matter how much the minority leader jumps up and down or how much the minority leader stomps his feet, we aren't going to let liberals get away with denying the American people an opportunity to be heard. Letting the American people decide this question is a reasonable approach, it is a fair approach, and it is the historical approach. It is the approach the other side advocated when the shoe was on the other foot, and it is what the American people deserve. They deserve an opportunity and responsibility that we do it right instead of rushing to judgment. Voters deserve the right to be heard. The American people want a reasonable justice, a person who will make the right decisions. As the American people continue voting during the Presidential election, they face a choice: Do they want just another Justice who will look to her heart and apply her own ethics and perspective when deciding important constitutional questions that impact every American or do they want a Justice who, like Justice Scalia, adheres to the Constitution and the rule of law and decides cases based on wherever the text takes him or her. We can't overstate how critical it is for the American people to understand what is at stake in this debate. Today take a little bit of time to discuss the impact that these two different visions would have on everyday Americans. Many leading Court observers believe that adding yet another liberal Justice to the Court whose decisions are unmoored from the constitutional text would lead to major changes in the Court's jurisprudence. As a recent New York Times article put it, adding another liberal to the Supreme Court ``would be the most consequential ideological shift on the Court . . . creating a liberal majority that would almost certainly reshape American law and American life.'' So it will impact all of us. According to the same article, a host of Supreme Court precedents on free speech, freedom of religion, the right to keep and bear arms, the death penalty, and abortion would be overturned. The article speculates that ``abortion rights would become more secure, and gun rights less so. . . . First Amendment arguments in cases on campaign finance, public unions, and commercial speech would meet a more skeptical reception.'' In that same article, one law school dean noted that with another liberal on the Court, ``the judicial debate over the fundamental possibility of ObamaCare would likely draw to an end.'' So let's consider just a few of the Supreme Court precedents that would likely be overturned with another liberal Justice on the Court. First and foremost, it is our Second Amendment rights that would fall squarely within the liberals' sights. The Heller decision, authored by Justice Scalia, recognized, based on the intent of the Framers, that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual constitutional right to gun ownership. Again, as one law professor noted in the New York Times, with another liberal in the Court, ``The five would narrow Heller to the point of irrelevancy.'' Another said: ``If we got a fifth liberal on the court, the pendulum would swing pretty quickly on gun control. . . . I expect that we'd see a major shift in the kind of gun control laws that get approved by the court.'' In other words, Heller and the individual constitutional rights it guarantees would be turned into a relic. It would be an ornament without any practical limiting effect on the government's infringement upon the constitutional right of an individual to have gun ownership. Once this happens, all bets are off on the right to keep and bear arms. Next, the First Amendment right of the American people to make their voices heard would be drastically curtailed if the Court overturns Citizens United. In fact, as a University of Chicago Law School professor said in the New York Times, ``Citizens United is on every liberal's list of opinions that ought to go.'' Freedom of religion protections under the First Amendment wouldn't be far behind. Another liberal Justice could allow the government to force Americans to comply with laws that violate their deeply held religious views. For example, a new Justice could provide the fifth vote to overturn the Hobby Lobby decision, which recognized the right of the owners of a closely held corporation to resist laws on religious grounds, such as ObamaCare's contraception mandate. Of course, we all know free speech protections are being eroded and diluted in this country. On college campuses across the country, speech isn't being protected because of the speaker's viewpoint. Rather than debate openly with opponents as Justice Scalia did, too many people today want to shut down debate and muzzle anybody who disagrees with them. [[Page S1071]] What other rights are at stake in this election? Incredibly important precedents under the First Amendment's establishment clause would be at risk. Of course, I am talking about Supreme Court cases allowing prayer at townhall meetings or permitting low-income parents to receive public school vouchers to defray the cost of the child's private school, including religious schools. Of course, while yet another liberal Justice could read narrowly the First and Second Amendments that are in the Constitution, he or she could read broadly those rights that are not in the Constitution at all. If yet another liberal is nominated to the Court, even reasonable restrictions on abortion enacted into law through the democratic process would be swept away. Just a few years ago the Court upheld the ban on partial birth abortion by a 5-to-4 vote in the case of Carhart. Partial birth abortion is a horrific practice that crushes an unborn baby's skull, killing it while its head is still in the womb. It is one very small step short of infanticide. If the American people elect a liberal during this Presidential election, and that President nominates another liberal to replace Justice Scalia, we can all expect a constitutional right to abortion on demand without limitation. In the words of one law professor, ``At-risk precedents run from campaign finance to commerce, from race to religion, and they include some signature Scalia projects, such as the Second Amendment. . . . Some would go quickly, like Citizens United, and some would go slower . . . but they'll go.'' The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRASSLEY. That leads me to a broader point. There is more at stake than the results of any particular case as important as those cases are. The American people need to consider whether they want their next Justice to decide cases based on the text of the Constitution as it was understood at the time it was adopted or whether Justices are free to update the Constitution according to their own moral and political philosophies. Should Justices apply accepted legal principles through sound reasoning of new facts or should they do legal back flips to reach their desired public policy goals? Of course, this second approach is not law. Instead, it is what Justice Scalia called ``legalistic argle-bargle'' and ``jiggery- pokery.'' Justice Scalia knew the rule of law was a law of rules. The rule of law is not a law of whatever is in the Justice's heart. When a Justice believes, as President Obama does, that any time he views the Constitution as unclear, he can apply his own life experience and empathy for his or her favorite causes. The Justice has a clear incentive to think the Constitution is unclear, but a Justice isn't entitled to read those views into the Constitution and impose them on the American people. Our Constitution sets up a Republic, not a government by judiciary. Unless the Constitution specifically prohibits the democratic process from reflecting the will of the people, the decisions are made by elected individuals who are accountable to the voters. The Supreme Court plays a very important role in keeping the branches of the Federal Government within constitutional powers, keeping the Federal and State governments within their constitutional sphere, and it ensures the government complies with the Bill of Rights. That is the basis for its legitimacy. When the Court reads the Constitution in ways that reflect the Justice's personal policy views rather than the text, it does not act legitimately. Instead, it denies the people the legal right to govern themselves. Justice Scalia understood this better than anyone. The more the Court reaches out and grabs power it is not entitled to hold, the more it legislates from the bench, the more decisions it robs from the American people. As a direct result, step-by-step and inch-by-inch, liberty is lost. As John Adams observed, ``Liberty, once lost, is lost forever.'' Since the days of the Warren Court, this is what liberal Justices have done. Under the guise of constitutional interpretation, they have imposed liberalism on the American people. They have done it on issues and in ways they couldn't achieve through the ballot box. This is the decision facing the American people during this Presidential election. If the American people elect a liberal as their next President, and he or she nominates a like-minded judge to replace Justice Scalia, liberalism will be imposed on the American people to a degree this country has never before witnessed. I hope anyone who cares about these important issues will take very serious note. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1069-S1071] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. BROWN. Madam President, in the last 2 minutes I would like to say a few more words about the Supreme Court vacancy. Four former U.S. attorneys from Ohio, Washington State, California, and Virginia published an op-ed that went around the country urging the Senate to promptly consider a Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice Scalia. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the writings of the former U.S. attorneys. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Steve Dettelbach, Jenny Durkan, Melinda Haag and Tim Heaphy are Democratic former U.S. attorneys for, respectively, Northern Ohio, Western Washington, Northern California and Western Virginia. As former U.S. attorneys in diverse districts that are home to more than 20 million Americans, we urge that the president promptly nominate, and the Senate promptly consider, a Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia. Both the plain language of the Constitution and plain truths regarding public safety and national security demand that result. For federal prosecutors, agents and criminal investigations, a year is a lifetime. We have seen real threats, whether it is the heroin epidemic or the threat of ISIS recruitment, facing the people in our communities each day. While law enforcement stands ready to protect the public from those threats, they need to know the rules of the road. Uncertainty about those rules impedes their efforts. Just as with the economy, uncertainty prevents good agents and prosecutors from deciding on investigative strategies and tactics, and making important charging decisions. The Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the hardest and most important questions facing law enforcement and our nation. [[Page S1070]] Even as we write today, unsettled legal questions regarding search and seizure, digital privacy and federal sentencing are either pending before the Supreme Court or headed there. It is unfair and unsafe to expect good federal agents, police and prosecutors to spend more than a year guessing whether their actions will hold up in court. And it is just as unfair to expect citizens whose rights and liberties are at stake to wait for answers while their homes, emails, cell phones, records and activities are investigated. Equally important, as lawyers and former public officials committed to the Constitution and the rule of law, it is incredible to us that anyone who claims fidelity to those ideas can argue that either the president or the Senate should not fulfill their duties. And we should be clear on what those duties are. Announcing ahead of time that the Senate will reject any nominee, or refusing to hold fair hearings, does not fulfill the Senate's duty to provide ``advice and consent'' on court nominees. The ``advice'' called for in the Constitution does not include, ``Just forget it, Mr. President.'' It is ironic that the arguments being made by those urging a year-plus delay are precisely the types of arguments that Scalia abhorred. They are based on politics and some vague notions of Senate ``interpretations'' of the Constitution. As U.S. attorneys we were constantly assessing the strength of constitutional and other legal arguments. And there was no more demanding jurist than Scalia when it came to supporting those arguments with written law. One argument is based on the ``Thurmond rule,'' named for the former senator from South Carolina, which calls for no confirmations in the final months of a president's term. But this ``rule'' has never been applied to the Supreme Court and it finds no home in the text of the Constitution. We would all have bought tickets to see Scalia question a lawyer who dared to raise an argument like that. Few things in the Constitution seem as unambiguous as term length. The president is elected for four years under Article II. There is no clause diminishing the president's duties in the last year, and as even Jeb Bush acknowledged, such notions are dangerous. Should the president stop fighting ISIS in his last year? Should senators facing an election year not be allowed to vote on judicial nominees so that the ``people can decide?'' Certainly not. The people already did decide what would happen from January 2013 to January 2017. They elected President Obama. In both our communities and court system, we don't have more than a year to blithely waste for political reasons. The safety concerns and dangers are pressing, and our leaders in the White House and the Senate do not have built-in vacation time on our dime. Mr. BROWN. I close just begging, urging, imploring, and beseeching my colleagues on the Republican side to move forward on the Supreme Court nominee. We have not had a Supreme Court vacancy for as long as a year since the Civil War because we were at war in the 1860s. The average nomination process for confirming a Supreme Court nominee when there are 8 members of the Supreme Court is only about 6 weeks. The longest, Justice Thomas, took 99 days. The President of the United States is elected for 4 years--not a 3-year term. A 4-year term has 300-plus days in the term. This Senator is disappointed--I will leave it at that--to hear that my colleagues have said there will not be hearings. Then they said that not only will there not be hearings for the President's nomination, they will not even meet with a nominee. This Senator finds it rather shameful for an institution with this kind of heritage and this kind of reputation that we don't do better than that. I urge my colleagues to do our jobs, do what we were elected to do, what we were sworn in to do, and do what we are paid to do to bring this nominee--vote against them if you like but bring up this nominee for real Senate consideration. I yield the floor, and I thank Senator Grassley for allowing me more time. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, Madam President, it is another day and another tantrum from the minority leader, but it doesn't matter how much the minority leader jumps up and down or how much the minority leader stomps his feet, we aren't going to let liberals get away with denying the American people an opportunity to be heard. Letting the American people decide this question is a reasonable approach, it is a fair approach, and it is the historical approach. It is the approach the other side advocated when the shoe was on the other foot, and it is what the American people deserve. They deserve an opportunity and responsibility that we do it right instead of rushing to judgment. Voters deserve the right to be heard. The American people want a reasonable justice, a person who will make the right decisions. As the American people continue voting during the Presidential election, they face a choice: Do they want just another Justice who will look to her heart and apply her own ethics and perspective when deciding important constitutional questions that impact every American or do they want a Justice who, like Justice Scalia, adheres to the Constitution and the rule of law and decides cases based on wherever the text takes him or her.

Of course, this second approach is not law. Instead, it is what Justice Scalia called ``legalistic argle-bargle'' and ``jiggery- pokery.'' Justice Scalia knew the rule of law was a law of rules. The rule of law is not a law of whatever is in the Justice's heart. When a Justice believes, as President Obama does, that any time he views the Constitution as unclear, he can apply his own life experience and empathy for his or her favorite causes. The Justice has a clear incentive to think the Constitution is unclear, but a Justice isn't entitled to read those views into the Constitution and impose them on the American people. Our Constitution sets up a Republic, not a government by judiciary. Unless the Constitution specifically prohibits the democratic process from reflecting the will of the people, the decisions are made by elected individuals who are accountable to the voters. The Supreme Court plays a very important role in keeping the branches of the Federal Government within constitutional powers, keeping the Federal and State governments within their constitutional sphere, and it ensures the government complies with the Bill of Rights. That is the basis for its legitimacy. When the Court reads the Constitution in ways that reflect the Justice's personal policy views rather than the text, it does not act legitimately. Instead, it denies the people the legal right to govern themselves. Justice Scalia understood this better than anyone. The more the Court reaches out and grabs power it is not entitled to hold, the more it legislates from the bench, the more decisions it robs from the American people. As a direct result, step-by-step and inch-by-inch, liberty is lost. As John Adams observed, ``Liberty, once lost, is lost forever.'' Since the days of the Warren Court, this is what liberal Justices have done. Under the guise of constitutional interpretation, they have imposed liberalism on the American people. They have done it on issues and in ways they couldn't achieve through the ballot box. This is the decision facing the American people during this Presidential election. If the American people elect a liberal as their next President, and he or she nominates a like-minded judge to replace Justice Scalia, liberalism will be imposed on the American people to a degree this country has never before witnessed. I hope anyone who cares about these important issues will take very serious note. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,15917,15917,15987,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1069-s1071] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] filling the supreme court vacancy mr. brown. madam president, in the last 2 minutes i would like to say a few more words about the supreme court vacancy. four former u.s. attorneys from ohio, washington state, california, and virginia published an op-ed that went around the country urging the senate to promptly consider a supreme court nominee to replace justice scalia. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the writings of the former u.s. attorneys. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: steve dettelbach, jenny durkan, melinda haag and tim heaphy are democratic former u.s. attorneys for, respectively, northern ohio, western washington, northern california and western virginia. as former u.s. attorneys in diverse districts that are home to more than 20 million americans, we urge that the president promptly nominate, and the senate promptly consider, a supreme court nominee to replace justice antonin scalia. both the plain language of the constitution and plain truths regarding public safety and national security demand that result. for federal prosecutors, agents and criminal investigations, a year is a lifetime. we have seen real threats, whether it is the heroin epidemic or the threat of isis recruitment, facing the people in our communities each day. while law enforcement stands ready to protect the public from those threats, they need to know the rules of the road. uncertainty about those rules impedes their efforts. just as with the economy, uncertainty prevents good agents and prosecutors from deciding on investigative strategies and tactics, and making important charging decisions. the supreme court is the ultimate arbiter of the hardest and most important questions facing law enforcement and our nation. [[page s1070]] even as we write today, unsettled legal questions regarding search and seizure, digital privacy and federal sentencing are either pending before the supreme court or headed there. it is unfair and unsafe to expect good federal agents, police and prosecutors to spend more than a year guessing whether their actions will hold up in court. and it is just as unfair to expect citizens whose rights and liberties are at stake to wait for answers while their homes, emails, cell phones, records and activities are investigated. equally important, as lawyers and former public officials committed to the constitution and the rule of law, it is incredible to us that anyone who claims fidelity to those ideas can argue that either the president or the senate should not fulfill their duties. and we should be clear on what those duties are. announcing ahead of time that the senate will reject any nominee, or refusing to hold fair hearings, does not fulfill the senate's duty to provide ``advice and consent'' on court nominees. the ``advice'' called for in the constitution does not include, ``just forget it, mr. president.'' it is ironic that the arguments being made by those urging a year-plus delay are precisely the types of arguments that scalia abhorred. they are based on politics and some vague notions of senate ``interpretations'' of the constitution. as u.s. attorneys we were constantly assessing the strength of constitutional and other legal arguments. and there was no more demanding jurist than scalia when it came to supporting those arguments with written law. one argument is based on the ``thurmond rule,'' named for the former senator from south carolina, which calls for no confirmations in the final months of a president's term. but this ``rule'' has never been applied to the supreme court and it finds no home in the text of the constitution. we would all have bought tickets to see scalia question a lawyer who dared to raise an argument like that. few things in the constitution seem as unambiguous as term length. the president is elected for four years under article ii. there is no clause diminishing the president's duties in the last year, and as even jeb bush acknowledged, such notions are dangerous. should the president stop fighting isis in his last year? should senators facing an election year not be allowed to vote on judicial nominees so that the ``people can decide?'' certainly not. the people already did decide what would happen from january 2013 to january 2017. they elected president obama. in both our communities and court system, we don't have more than a year to blithely waste for political reasons. the safety concerns and dangers are pressing, and our leaders in the white house and the senate do not have built-in vacation time on our dime. mr. brown. i close just begging, urging, imploring, and beseeching my colleagues on the republican side to move forward on the supreme court nominee. we have not had a supreme court vacancy for as long as a year since the civil war because we were at war in the 1860s. the average nomination process for confirming a supreme court nominee when there are 8 members of the supreme court is only about 6 weeks. the longest, justice thomas, took 99 days. the president of the united states is elected for 4 years--not a 3-year term. a 4-year term has 300-plus days in the term. this senator is disappointed--i will leave it at that--to hear that my colleagues have said there will not be hearings. then they said that not only will there not be hearings for the president's nomination, they will not even meet with a nominee. this senator finds it rather shameful for an institution with this kind of heritage and this kind of reputation that we don't do better than that. i urge my colleagues to do our jobs, do what we were elected to do, what we were sworn in to do, and do what we are paid to do to bring this nominee--vote against them if you like but bring up this nominee for real senate consideration. i yield the floor, and i thank senator grassley for allowing me more time. the acting president pro tempore. the senator from iowa. mr. grassley. well, madam president, it is another day and another tantrum from the minority leader, but it doesn't matter how much the minority leader jumps up and down or how much the minority leader stomps his feet, we aren't going to let liberals get away with denying the american people an opportunity to be heard. letting the american people decide this question is a reasonable approach, it is a fair approach, and it is the historical approach. it is the approach the other side advocated when the shoe was on the other foot, and it is what the american people deserve. they deserve an opportunity and responsibility that we do it right instead of rushing to judgment. voters deserve the right to be heard. the american people want a reasonable justice, a person who will make the right decisions. as the american people continue voting during the presidential election, they face a choice: do they want just another justice who will look to her heart and apply her own ethics and perspective when deciding important constitutional questions that impact every american or do they want a justice who, like justice scalia, adheres to the constitution and the rule of law and decides cases based on wherever the text takes him or her. we can't overstate how critical it is for the american people to understand what is at stake in this debate. today take a little bit of time to discuss the impact that these two different visions would have on everyday americans. many leading court observers believe that adding yet another liberal justice to the court whose decisions are unmoored from the constitutional text would lead to major changes in the court's jurisprudence. as a recent new york times article put it, adding another liberal to the supreme court ``would be the most consequential ideological shift on the court . . . creating a liberal majority that would almost certainly reshape american law and american life.'' so it will impact all of us. according to the same article, a host of supreme court precedents on free speech, freedom of religion, the right to keep and bear arms, the death penalty, and abortion would be overturned. the article speculates that ``abortion rights would become more secure, and gun rights less so. . . . first amendment arguments in cases on campaign finance, public unions, and commercial speech would meet a more skeptical reception.'' in that same article, one law school dean noted that with another liberal on the court, ``the judicial debate over the fundamental possibility of obamacare would likely draw to an end.'' so let's consider just a few of the supreme court precedents that would likely be overturned with another liberal justice on the court. first and foremost, it is our second amendment rights that would fall squarely within the liberals' sights. the heller decision, authored by justice scalia, recognized, based on the intent of the framers, that the second amendment guarantees an individual constitutional right to gun ownership. again, as one law professor noted in the new york times, with another liberal in the court, ``the five would narrow heller to the point of irrelevancy.'' another said: ``if we got a fifth liberal on the court, the pendulum would swing pretty quickly on gun control. . . . i expect that we'd see a major shift in the kind of gun control laws that get approved by the court.'' in other words, heller and the individual constitutional rights it guarantees would be turned into a relic. it would be an ornament without any practical limiting effect on the government's infringement upon the constitutional right of an individual to have gun ownership. once this happens, all bets are off on the right to keep and bear arms. next, the first amendment right of the american people to make their voices heard would be drastically curtailed if the court overturns citizens united. in fact, as a university of chicago law school professor said in the new york times, ``citizens united is on every liberal's list of opinions that ought to go.'' freedom of religion protections under the first amendment wouldn't be far behind. another liberal justice could allow the government to force americans to comply with laws that violate their deeply held religious views. for example, a new justice could provide the fifth vote to overturn the hobby lobby decision, which recognized the right of the owners of a closely held corporation to resist laws on religious grounds, such as obamacare's contraception mandate. of course, we all know free speech protections are being eroded and diluted in this country. on college campuses across the country, speech isn't being protected because of the speaker's viewpoint. rather than debate openly with opponents as justice scalia did, too many people today want to shut down debate and muzzle anybody who disagrees with them. [[page s1071]] what other rights are at stake in this election? incredibly important precedents under the first amendment's establishment clause would be at risk. of course, i am talking about supreme court cases allowing prayer at townhall meetings or permitting low-income parents to receive public school vouchers to defray the cost of the child's private school, including religious schools. of course, while yet another liberal justice could read narrowly the first and second amendments that are in the constitution, he or she could read broadly those rights that are not in the constitution at all. if yet another liberal is nominated to the court, even reasonable restrictions on abortion enacted into law through the democratic process would be swept away. just a few years ago the court upheld the ban on partial birth abortion by a 5-to-4 vote in the case of carhart. partial birth abortion is a horrific practice that crushes an unborn baby's skull, killing it while its head is still in the womb. it is one very small step short of infanticide. if the american people elect a liberal during this presidential election, and that president nominates another liberal to replace justice scalia, we can all expect a constitutional right to abortion on demand without limitation. in the words of one law professor, ``at-risk precedents run from campaign finance to commerce, from race to religion, and they include some signature scalia projects, such as the second amendment. . . . some would go quickly, like citizens united, and some would go slower . . . but they'll go.'' the acting president pro tempore. the senator's time has expired. mr. grassley. i ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes. the acting president pro tempore. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. grassley. that leads me to a broader point. there is more at stake than the results of any particular case as important as those cases are. the american people need to consider whether they want their next justice to decide cases based on the text of the constitution as it was understood at the time it was adopted or whether justices are free to update the constitution according to their own moral and political philosophies. should justices apply accepted legal principles through sound reasoning of new facts or should they do legal back flips to reach their desired public policy goals? of course, this second approach is not law. instead, it is what justice scalia called ``legalistic argle-bargle'' and ``jiggery- pokery.'' justice scalia knew the rule of law was a law of rules. the rule of law is not a law of whatever is in the justice's heart. when a justice believes, as president obama does, that any time he views the constitution as unclear, he can apply his own life experience and empathy for his or her favorite causes. the justice has a clear incentive to think the constitution is unclear, but a justice isn't entitled to read those views into the constitution and impose them on the american people. our constitution sets up a republic, not a government by judiciary. unless the constitution specifically prohibits the democratic process from reflecting the will of the people, the decisions are made by elected individuals who are accountable to the voters. the supreme court plays a very important role in keeping the branches of the federal government within constitutional powers, keeping the federal and state governments within their constitutional sphere, and it ensures the government complies with the bill of rights. that is the basis for its legitimacy. when the court reads the constitution in ways that reflect the justice's personal policy views rather than the text, it does not act legitimately. instead, it denies the people the legal right to govern themselves. justice scalia understood this better than anyone. the more the court reaches out and grabs power it is not entitled to hold, the more it legislates from the bench, the more decisions it robs from the american people. as a direct result, step-by-step and inch-by-inch, liberty is lost. as john adams observed, ``liberty, once lost, is lost forever.'' since the days of the warren court, this is what liberal justices have done. under the guise of constitutional interpretation, they have imposed liberalism on the american people. they have done it on issues and in ways they couldn't achieve through the ballot box. this is the decision facing the american people during this presidential election. if the american people elect a liberal as their next president, and he or she nominates a like-minded judge to replace justice scalia, liberalism will be imposed on the american people to a degree this country has never before witnessed. i hope anyone who cares about these important issues will take very serious note. i yield the floor. the acting president pro tempore. the senator from nebraska. ____________________",15917
CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1065-3,CREC-2016-02-29,114,COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1065-S1068] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, as we are all sadly aware, the United States is experiencing an epidemic of drug overdose deaths. The statistics are just startling. Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137 percent, including a 200-percent increase in overdose deaths attributed to the use of opioids. West Virginia has the unfortunate distinction of leading the Nation in drug-related overdose deaths--more than twice the national average. As I travel across the State, I hear constantly about the devastation caused by this epidemic. West Virginia communities are grappling with the seriousness and pain of addiction. No family or community--mine included--is immune from this pain. As one of my constituents put it, ``We must give our young people a reason not to start using something that robs them of everything they have.'' Other West Virginians have bravely shared their family's stories of addiction's pain with me. In the powerful words of one of my constituents, ``It only takes a few seconds to use drugs--but a lifetime to fight.'' Drug addiction is a diseases that knows no boundaries, and West Virginia is certainly not alone in this fight. My colleagues in the Senate--including, I am sure, the Acting President pro tempore--return each week with similar stories. No matter our political party, we should all agree on one thing, we must act to change these horrifying statistics and to save lives. Some steps have already been taken to address this drug epidemic. The appropriations bill we passed last December included funding to expand prevention efforts. It included improved data collection and new treatment services, training for our servicemembers who [[Page S1066]] are battling addiction, and training for the first responders who are responding to these drug overdoses. Today we hope to begin debate on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I thank my colleagues Senator Portman, Senator Ayotte, and Senator Whitehouse for their leadership on this important legislation. This bipartisan bill, known as CARA, addresses the opioid epidemic by expanding prevention and education. It also promotes the resources needed for treatment and recovery. It includes reforms to help law enforcement respond to the drug epidemic, and it supports long-term recovery efforts--which, as we see in my State of West Virginia, we don't have enough treatment options, particularly in the long-term recovery area. The legislation also expands the availability of naloxone, a lifesaving drug that helps to reverse the effects of an overdose, and we are also creating disposal sites for unwanted prescriptions. CARA provides resources for treatment alternatives to incarceration, such as the successful and expanding drug court programs that operate in West Virginia and many other States. We just had a graduation the other day with some great success stories included in that from the drug court. According to the Beckley Register Herald, counties with drug courts have already seen cost savings and deep declines of recidivism rates among graduates. CARA also provides a provision to improve treatment programs for pregnant women and mothers who have substance abuse disorder. Another startling statistic is the number of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome that has increased fivefold from the years 2000 to the year 2012. Last fall, I introduced the Improving Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women Act, with Senators Ayotte, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar. The CARA act provides a provision that could play a critical role in preventing neonatal abstinence syndrome and getting treatment to pregnant women and new mothers. Also, last fall I worked with Senator Markey and others to help restore drug take-back days and keep medications out of the wrong hands. We all probably have some medication in our own medicine chests that are no longer necessary and that we don't need to have. It might have been for a family member. It is time to clean out those medicine chests. I participated in last year's program in Charleston, WV, and was pleased to see the overwhelming response. CARA focuses on the programs that work and will streamline efforts across multiple Federal agencies. In order to further address the needs of our communities, I am working on several bipartisan amendments on this bill. These amendments include solutions to improve prescribing practices and prevent overprescribing. Too many stories of addiction start with patients taking painkillers after a minor surgery or a minor injury. That is why I am pleased to be working with Senator Gillibrand on an effort that would require clear CDC guidelines for prescribing opioids for acute pain--a tooth extraction, maybe a broken arm, something that doesn't last forever, but the pain is acute in the beginning but fades rather quickly. I also am pleased to be working with Senator Warren on an amendment that allows doctors to partially fill certain opioid prescriptions. These will reduce the number of unused painkillers sitting in our medicine cabinets and help to prevent future cases of drug abuse and addiction. In order to reduce the number of overdose deaths, I am working with Senator Kaine to allow doctors to coprescribe the lifesaving drug naloxone when they prescribe an opioid. This would make naloxone more widely available in Federal health care settings, such as community health centers, VA clinics, and DOD facilities. I am also focused on tackling one of the saddest realities of this epidemic. In my State of West Virginia, babies born exposed to opioids during pregnancy are approximately three times the national average. Every 25 minutes in this country a baby is born with addiction. Nationwide, this condition has increased fivefold from the years 2000 to 2012. This amendment will provide clear guidelines to encourage the creation of residential pediatric recovery centers, like the wonderful Lily's Place in Huntington, WV. I am pleased to be working with Senator King from Maine and Congressman Evan Jenkins from West Virginia on this effort. CARA represents a positive step forward in addressing the opioid crisis. The four amendments that I have outlined, I believe, will strengthen the bill. They would prevent addiction, promote recovery, and curb the scourge of drug addiction in my State and in others across this country. There is much work ahead for all of us in this area. The actions we are hopefully taking here this week in Washington are simply first steps. This bill builds on the tireless work being done at the State and local levels by communities, law enforcement, and health professionals all across this country. They are working together. By working together, we can change these statistics and stop more tragedies from occurring--stop the human tragedy of losing a loved one, of losing a mother or father. I urge my colleagues to begin debate on CARA this evening and to support this important legislation. I am concerned we are in jeopardy of losing the next generation. So we have much work to do. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as we have heard from the Senator from West Virginia, this week the Senate will begin consideration of a bipartisan bill that targets an epidemic that is raging across the country, but apparently it is especially hard-hitting in places such as West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the like. But this abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin is not just isolated to those areas, even though the leaders of this particular legislation come from places such as Minnesota, Rhode Island, Ohio, and New Hampshire. Sadly, Texas has been no exception. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in Texas opioid-related drug deaths have increased by 30 percent since 2002. Houston is widely recognized by the DEA and law enforcement officials as a key hub for the trafficking of illicit prescription drugs. In South Texas, right next to the U.S.-Mexico border, the transnational criminal organizations are exploiting our porous border to import increasingly large amounts of hard narcotics like heroin, which ultimately wreaks havoc in towns and cities across America. In 2014 alone, drug cartels successfully smuggled more than 250,000 pounds of heroin across our borders and into the United States at a street value of approximately $25 billion. These are the same criminals who traffic in human beings, including young girls and boys. These are the same people who traffic in illegal immigrants. These are the same people who traffic in illegal drugs. Indeed, this has become such big business and the network so large that these transnational criminal organizations are basically in on everything and anything that will make them money, including transporting these terrible drugs like heroin across the border. As we all know and have heard, this epidemic destroys families, it increases the crime rate, and it robs millions of Americans of their future. As I mentioned a moment ago, thousands are dying every year. That is why the bill we are voting on this afternoon, called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, is so important. It will help give families and law enforcement additional resources to beat drug addiction through proven treatment programs. I am proud to cosponsor the legislation. The reason we have been able to move this bill forward so far--and it passed unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago-- is because it reflects bipartisan input as well as bipartisan concern with this epidemic. As I mentioned earlier, I wish to particularly recognize the junior Senators from Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Ohio--Senators Whitehouse, Portman, and Ayotte--for their laserlike focus on this legislation and making sure that it is at the top of our list of things we need to do this legislative session. By highlighting how bad the problem is in our country and providing legislation to address it, they [[Page S1067]] are helping us attack this epidemic head-on. I must say that while so far this legislation has moved forward on a strong bipartisan basis, there are some signals on the horizon that indicate some potential trouble. At a press conference after the Judiciary Committee unanimously passed the bill, several of our friends on the other side of the aisle were explicit. They said that if the Senate did not add hundreds of millions of dollars in duplicative funding, they might withhold their support. This legislation is an authorization bill, and it does not appropriate funds. Our friends across the aisle know that if an appropriation is added to this legislation, particularly if it is duplicative, it causes a number of problems. First of all, a spending bill can't originate here in the Senate. So it raises a so-called blue- slip problem. But perhaps just as importantly, this is not an orderly process by which we determine what is actually needed and to make sure that we are appropriating money in a fiscally responsible sort of way. I don't have to remind the Acting President pro tempore or anybody else who is listening that we have a $19 trillion debt in our country, and recklessly throwing money at a problem rather than carefully targeting it in a fiscally responsible way is simply irresponsible. It seems to be part of the message: Give us what we want or we might hijack a bipartisan bill that would literally save lives. I hope I am wrong, and I hope the signals on the horizon don't prove to ultimately be true. But it does seem like this is part of a new political strategy. Earlier this month, we know that our Democrat colleagues blocked a bipartisan Energy bill from moving forward on an unrelated issue-- something on which Senator Murkowski has shown the patience of Job, trying to work through this process so we can get back on the Energy bill rather than having it hijacked by an extraneous subject that could well and should well be handled in a different way, certainly separately. This is not the way the Senate gets anything accomplished. As I have said before, playing political games with important issues like fighting drug addiction is what lost our friends the majority in 2014. I urge the Democratic leadership to listen to those in their own caucus who have worked alongside Republicans in a responsible fashion to draft and put forward this bill that is so clearly needed in this country. This afternoon I hope we will move forward on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I hope we will consider it and consider amendments that are being offered in good faith on both sides to try to improve the legislation. But what we should not do is allow anyone to hijack this important legislation for partisan purposes. I think we should restrain ourselves from any impulse to do so. It happened, unfortunately, on the bipartisan Energy bill. It has been threatened on this legislation. But my hope is that cooler heads will prevail. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, also known as the CARA Act. Our country is facing a prescription drug epidemic, and today is a good step toward addressing this crisis. This is a crisis I have been dealing with since my days as Governor of the great State of West Virginia. Opioid abuse is not only ravaging my State, it is ravaging the country. Drug overdose deaths have soared by more than 700 percent since 1999. We lost 600 West Virginians to opioids last year alone. But our State is not unique; every day in our country, 51 Americans die from opioid abuse, and since 1999 we have lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse. Think about that. That is more people than we have in any city in the State of West Virginia. This bill is an important first step. First of all, it will authorize $77.9 million in grant funding for prevention and recovery efforts. It will expand prevention and educational efforts--particularly aimed at teens, parents and other caretakers, and aging populations--to prevent the abuse of opioids and heroin and to promote treatment and recovery. It will expand the availability of naloxone to law enforcement agencies and other first responders to help in the reversal of overdoses to save lives. It will expand disposable sites for unwanted prescription medications to keep them out of the hands of our children and adolescents. It will launch an evidence-based opioid and heroin treatment and intervention program to expand best practices throughout the country. It will also strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs to help States monitor and track prescription drug diversion. While this bill is a good start and addresses critical problems, there is more that needs to be done. I will be offering several amendments to improve the bill by changing the FDA's mission, providing grants for consumer education, and requiring prescriber training. I firmly believe we need cultural change at the FDA, and that is why I introduced Changing the Culture of the FDA Act. It simply does exactly what it says--it changes that culture. My amendment to CARA, based on the Changing the Culture of the FDA Act, would amend the FDA's mission statement to include language that will require the agency to take into account the public health impact of the Nation's opioid epidemic when approving and regulating opioid medications and will hold the agency responsible for addressing the opioid epidemic. It is hard to believe that right now as all of these new drugs are coming to the market and all of these pharmaceutical manufacturers are producing this new product, basically the mission statement has never taken into account the impact of the opioid epidemic on the public's health in this Nation. Now that we see it is truly an epidemic, we think this is a much needed change, and hopefully it will be approved. This builds on and solidifies the FDA's recently stated goal to fundamentally reexamine the risk-benefit calculations for opioids and ensures that the agency considers the wider public health effects. We need a change in the culture of the FDA, but we also need to make sure the advocacy groups that fight this battle every day are armed with the resources they need to stem this tide. I am also submitting an amendment that will establish consumer education grants through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to raise awareness about the risk of opioid addiction and overdose. This epidemic is one that needs to be fought on all fronts, but most importantly, we need to fight it on the frontlines with the prescribers, those people whom we trust to get the training they need. That is why I will also submit an amendment that will require that medical practitioners receive the needed training on the safe prescribing of opioids prior to renewing their DEA registration to prescribe controlled substances. If you talk to any of our medical physicians throughout the country, they get very little training as far as the effects of these drugs, and we think it is well past time that they get the needed education, as well as continuing education, so that we can keep ahead of the prescriptions they are putting on the markets and basically keep them from harming people every day. According to the National Institutes of Health, in 2012, more than 250 million prescriptions were written in the United States for opioid painkillers. That equals one bottle of pain pills for every U.S. adult. Can you imagine one bottle of pain pills for every U.S. adult in this country? It is unbelievable. We are the most addictive Nation on Earth. Five percent of the population in the United States of America--there are 330 million of us and 700 billion humans on the planet Earth-- consumes 80 percent of the opioids in the world. It is just unheard of. Until we ensure that every prescriber has a strong understanding of safe opioid prescribing practices and the very great risk of opioid addiction, abuse, and overdose deaths, we will continue to see too many people prescribed too many of these dangerous [[Page S1068]] drugs which can lead them down a tragic path, and that is why we need to educate people. There is one other subject I wanted to address, and I hope the FDA and this administration will look at it very seriously, and that is the professionals on advisory committees. When an opioid is coming to market, I believe and I believe a lot of Americans believe that this goes through a review process. These professionals basically are looking at this, and they make a recommendation as to whether this drug should be on the market, the need for this drug, and the effect this drug will have on people's lives. If they rule against this drug--and let's say they have an 11-to-2 ruling, such as Zohydro did--then the request for that drug to come to market should have to come before Congress. The FDA--the director and the staff--needs to basically come and explain to Congress why this potent drug needs to come on the market when basically their advisory committee and those people who are the professionals basically agree not to let it come to market. This is a conversation that has to be had. We have to make sure we understand why we are putting all of these products on the market and the effect they are going to have on the public. That is another topic we hope to address also as this bill comes to the floor. The bottom line is that I am pleased the Senate is working in a bipartisan manner. This is how we need to work to solve the major challenges our country faces. By working in a bipartisan way, we will have, as I understand, an open amendment process which is so needed and critical to move this legislation through. I appreciate that. I believe my amendments will strengthen this bill, but I also believe more needs to be done. We must provide the critical resources needed to stem this tide. I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen this bill and to begin to address this crisis head-on. This country has faced every crisis we have ever had, and we have overcome it. This is one we haven't attempted. For some reason, it is a silent killer--out of sight, out of mind. It will take all of us being Americans and basically using our faith that we have that we can fix these problems, to save Democrats, save Republicans, save Independents, and save everybody. This cannot be a partisan issue because I can tell my colleagues that opiates and the addiction of opiates have no partisan home. It is truly bipartisan. It attacks us all. I appreciate my colleagues, and I look forward to working with them to work through this important piece of legislation. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1065-S1068] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, as we are all sadly aware, the United States is experiencing an epidemic of drug overdose deaths. The statistics are just startling. Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137 percent, including a 200-percent increase in overdose deaths attributed to the use of opioids. West Virginia has the unfortunate distinction of leading the Nation in drug-related overdose deaths--more than twice the national average. As I travel across the State, I hear constantly about the devastation caused by this epidemic. West Virginia communities are grappling with the seriousness and pain of addiction. No family or community--mine included--is immune from this pain. As one of my constituents put it, ``We must give our young people a reason not to start using something that robs them of everything they have.'' Other West Virginians have bravely shared their family's stories of addiction's pain with me. In the powerful words of one of my constituents, ``It only takes a few seconds to use drugs--but a lifetime to fight.'' Drug addiction is a diseases that knows no boundaries, and West Virginia is certainly not alone in this fight. My colleagues in the Senate--including, I am sure, the Acting President pro tempore--return each week with similar stories. No matter our political party, we should all agree on one thing, we must act to change these horrifying statistics and to save lives. Some steps have already been taken to address this drug epidemic. The appropriations bill we passed last December included funding to expand prevention efforts. It included improved data collection and new treatment services, training for our servicemembers who [[Page S1066]] are battling addiction, and training for the first responders who are responding to these drug overdoses. Today we hope to begin debate on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I thank my colleagues Senator Portman, Senator Ayotte, and Senator Whitehouse for their leadership on this important legislation. This bipartisan bill, known as CARA, addresses the opioid epidemic by expanding prevention and education. It also promotes the resources needed for treatment and recovery. It includes reforms to help law enforcement respond to the drug epidemic, and it supports long-term recovery efforts--which, as we see in my State of West Virginia, we don't have enough treatment options, particularly in the long-term recovery area. The legislation also expands the availability of naloxone, a lifesaving drug that helps to reverse the effects of an overdose, and we are also creating disposal sites for unwanted prescriptions. CARA provides resources for treatment alternatives to incarceration, such as the successful and expanding drug court programs that operate in West Virginia and many other States. We just had a graduation the other day with some great success stories included in that from the drug court. According to the Beckley Register Herald, counties with drug courts have already seen cost savings and deep declines of recidivism rates among graduates. CARA also provides a provision to improve treatment programs for pregnant women and mothers who have substance abuse disorder. Another startling statistic is the number of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome that has increased fivefold from the years 2000 to the year 2012. Last fall, I introduced the Improving Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women Act, with Senators Ayotte, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar. The CARA act provides a provision that could play a critical role in preventing neonatal abstinence syndrome and getting treatment to pregnant women and new mothers. Also, last fall I worked with Senator Markey and others to help restore drug take-back days and keep medications out of the wrong hands. We all probably have some medication in our own medicine chests that are no longer necessary and that we don't need to have. It might have been for a family member. It is time to clean out those medicine chests. I participated in last year's program in Charleston, WV, and was pleased to see the overwhelming response. CARA focuses on the programs that work and will streamline efforts across multiple Federal agencies. In order to further address the needs of our communities, I am working on several bipartisan amendments on this bill. These amendments include solutions to improve prescribing practices and prevent overprescribing. Too many stories of addiction start with patients taking painkillers after a minor surgery or a minor injury. That is why I am pleased to be working with Senator Gillibrand on an effort that would require clear CDC guidelines for prescribing opioids for acute pain--a tooth extraction, maybe a broken arm, something that doesn't last forever, but the pain is acute in the beginning but fades rather quickly. I also am pleased to be working with Senator Warren on an amendment that allows doctors to partially fill certain opioid prescriptions. These will reduce the number of unused painkillers sitting in our medicine cabinets and help to prevent future cases of drug abuse and addiction. In order to reduce the number of overdose deaths, I am working with Senator Kaine to allow doctors to coprescribe the lifesaving drug naloxone when they prescribe an opioid. This would make naloxone more widely available in Federal health care settings, such as community health centers, VA clinics, and DOD facilities. I am also focused on tackling one of the saddest realities of this epidemic. In my State of West Virginia, babies born exposed to opioids during pregnancy are approximately three times the national average. Every 25 minutes in this country a baby is born with addiction. Nationwide, this condition has increased fivefold from the years 2000 to 2012. This amendment will provide clear guidelines to encourage the creation of residential pediatric recovery centers, like the wonderful Lily's Place in Huntington, WV. I am pleased to be working with Senator King from Maine and Congressman Evan Jenkins from West Virginia on this effort. CARA represents a positive step forward in addressing the opioid crisis. The four amendments that I have outlined, I believe, will strengthen the bill. They would prevent addiction, promote recovery, and curb the scourge of drug addiction in my State and in others across this country. There is much work ahead for all of us in this area. The actions we are hopefully taking here this week in Washington are simply first steps. This bill builds on the tireless work being done at the State and local levels by communities, law enforcement, and health professionals all across this country. They are working together. By working together, we can change these statistics and stop more tragedies from occurring--stop the human tragedy of losing a loved one, of losing a mother or father. I urge my colleagues to begin debate on CARA this evening and to support this important legislation. I am concerned we are in jeopardy of losing the next generation. So we have much work to do. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as we have heard from the Senator from West Virginia, this week the Senate will begin consideration of a bipartisan bill that targets an epidemic that is raging across the country, but apparently it is especially hard-hitting in places such as West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the like. But this abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin is not just isolated to those areas, even though the leaders of this particular legislation come from places such as Minnesota, Rhode Island, Ohio, and New Hampshire. Sadly, Texas has been no exception. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in Texas opioid-related drug deaths have increased by 30 percent since 2002. Houston is widely recognized by the DEA and law enforcement officials as a key hub for the trafficking of illicit prescription drugs. In South Texas, right next to the U.S.-Mexico border, the transnational criminal organizations are exploiting our porous border to import increasingly large amounts of hard narcotics like heroin, which ultimately wreaks havoc in towns and cities across America. In 2014 alone, drug cartels successfully smuggled more than 250,000 pounds of heroin across our borders and into the United States at a street value of approximately $25 billion. These are the same criminals who traffic in human beings, including young girls and boys. These are the same people who traffic in illegal immigrants. These are the same people who traffic in illegal drugs. Indeed, this has become such big business and the network so large that these transnational criminal organizations are basically in on everything and anything that will make them money, including transporting these terrible drugs like heroin across the border. As we all know and have heard, this epidemic destroys families, it increases the crime rate, and it robs millions of Americans of their future. As I mentioned a moment ago, thousands are dying every year. That is why the bill we are voting on this afternoon, called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, is so important. It will help give families and law enforcement additional resources to beat drug addiction through proven treatment programs. I am proud to cosponsor the legislation. The reason we have been able to move this bill forward so far--and it passed unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago-- is because it reflects bipartisan input as well as bipartisan concern with this epidemic. As I mentioned earlier, I wish to particularly recognize the junior Senators from Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Ohio--Senators Whitehouse, Portman, and Ayotte--for their laserlike focus on this legislation and making sure that it is at the top of our list of things we need to do this legislative session. By highlighting how bad the problem is in our country and providing legislation to address it, they [[Page S1067]] are helping us attack this epidemic head-on. I must say that while so far this legislation has moved forward on a strong bipartisan basis, there are some signals on the horizon that indicate some potential trouble. At a press conference after the Judiciary Committee unanimously passed the bill, several of our friends on the other side of the aisle were explicit. They said that if the Senate did not add hundreds of millions of dollars in duplicative funding, they might withhold their support. This legislation is an authorization bill, and it does not appropriate funds. Our friends across the aisle know that if an appropriation is added to this legislation, particularly if it is duplicative, it causes a number of problems. First of all, a spending bill can't originate here in the Senate. So it raises a so-called blue- slip problem. But perhaps just as importantly, this is not an orderly process by which we determine what is actually needed and to make sure that we are appropriating money in a fiscally responsible sort of way. I don't have to remind the Acting President pro tempore or anybody else who is listening that we have a $19 trillion debt in our country, and recklessly throwing money at a problem rather than carefully targeting it in a fiscally responsible way is simply irresponsible. It seems to be part of the message: Give us what we want or we might hijack a bipartisan bill that would literally save lives. I hope I am wrong, and I hope the signals on the horizon don't prove to ultimately be true. But it does seem like this is part of a new political strategy. Earlier this month, we know that our Democrat colleagues blocked a bipartisan Energy bill from moving forward on an unrelated issue-- something on which Senator Murkowski has shown the patience of Job, trying to work through this process so we can get back on the Energy bill rather than having it hijacked by an extraneous subject that could well and should well be handled in a different way, certainly separately. This is not the way the Senate gets anything accomplished. As I have said before, playing political games with important issues like fighting drug addiction is what lost our friends the majority in 2014. I urge the Democratic leadership to listen to those in their own caucus who have worked alongside Republicans in a responsible fashion to draft and put forward this bill that is so clearly needed in this country. This afternoon I hope we will move forward on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I hope we will consider it and consider amendments that are being offered in good faith on both sides to try to improve the legislation. But what we should not do is allow anyone to hijack this important legislation for partisan purposes. I think we should restrain ourselves from any impulse to do so. It happened, unfortunately, on the bipartisan Energy bill. It has been threatened on this legislation. But my hope is that cooler heads will prevail. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015, also known as the CARA Act. Our country is facing a prescription drug epidemic, and today is a good step toward addressing this crisis. This is a crisis I have been dealing with since my days as Governor of the great State of West Virginia. Opioid abuse is not only ravaging my State, it is ravaging the country. Drug overdose deaths have soared by more than 700 percent since 1999. We lost 600 West Virginians to opioids last year alone. But our State is not unique; every day in our country, 51 Americans die from opioid abuse, and since 1999 we have lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse. Think about that. That is more people than we have in any city in the State of West Virginia. This bill is an important first step. First of all, it will authorize $77.9 million in grant funding for prevention and recovery efforts. It will expand prevention and educational efforts--particularly aimed at teens, parents and other caretakers, and aging populations--to prevent the abuse of opioids and heroin and to promote treatment and recovery. It will expand the availability of naloxone to law enforcement agencies and other first responders to help in the reversal of overdoses to save lives. It will expand disposable sites for unwanted prescription medications to keep them out of the hands of our children and adolescents. It will launch an evidence-based opioid and heroin treatment and intervention program to expand best practices throughout the country. It will also strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs to help States monitor and track prescription drug diversion. While this bill is a good start and addresses critical problems, there is more that needs to be done. I will be offering several amendments to improve the bill by changing the FDA's mission, providing grants for consumer education, and requiring prescriber training. I firmly believe we need cultural change at the FDA, and that is why I introduced Changing the Culture of the FDA Act. It simply does exactly what it says--it changes that culture. My amendment to CARA, based on the Changing the Culture of the FDA Act, would amend the FDA's mission statement to include language that will require the agency to take into account the public health impact of the Nation's opioid epidemic when approving and regulating opioid medications and will hold the agency responsible for addressing the opioid epidemic. It is hard to believe that right now as all of these new drugs are coming to the market and all of these pharmaceutical manufacturers are producing this new product, basically the mission statement has never taken into account the impact of the opioid epidemic on the public's health in this Nation. Now that we see it is truly an epidemic, we think this is a much needed change, and hopefully it will be approved. This builds on and solidifies the FDA's recently stated goal to fundamentally reexamine the risk-benefit calculations for opioids and ensures that the agency considers the wider public health effects. We need a change in the culture of the FDA, but we also need to make sure the advocacy groups that fight this battle every day are armed with the resources they need to stem this tide. I am also submitting an amendment that will establish consumer education grants through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to raise awareness about the risk of opioid addiction and overdose. This epidemic is one that needs to be fought on all fronts, but most importantly, we need to fight it on the frontlines with the prescribers, those people whom we trust to get the training they need. That is why I will also submit an amendment that will require that medical practitioners receive the needed training on the safe prescribing of opioids prior to renewing their DEA registration to prescribe controlled substances. If you talk to any of our medical physicians throughout the country, they get very little training as far as the effects of these drugs, and we think it is well past time that they get the needed education, as well as continuing education, so that we can keep ahead of the prescriptions they are putting on the markets and basically keep them from harming people every day. According to the National Institutes of Health, in 2012, more than 250 million prescriptions were written in the United States for opioid painkillers. That equals one bottle of pain pills for every U.S. adult. Can you imagine one bottle of pain pills for every U.S. adult in this country? It is unbelievable. We are the most addictive Nation on Earth. Five percent of the population in the United States of America--there are 330 million of us and 700 billion humans on the planet Earth-- consumes 80 percent of the opioids in the world. It is just unheard of. Until we ensure that every prescriber has a strong understanding of safe opioid prescribing practices and the very great risk of opioid addiction, abuse, and overdose deaths, we will continue to see too many people prescribed too many of these dangerous [[Page S1068]] drugs which can lead them down a tragic path, and that is why we need to educate people. There is one other subject I wanted to address, and I hope the FDA and this administration will look at it very seriously, and that is the professionals on advisory committees. When an opioid is coming to market, I believe and I believe a lot of Americans believe that this goes through a review process. These professionals basically are looking at this, and they make a recommendation as to whether this drug should be on the market, the need for this drug, and the effect this drug will have on people's lives. If they rule against this drug--and let's say they have an 11-to-2 ruling, such as Zohydro did--then the request for that drug to come to market should have to come before Congress. The FDA--the director and the staff--needs to basically come and explain to Congress why this potent drug needs to come on the market when basically their advisory committee and those people who are the professionals basically agree not to let it come to market. This is a conversation that has to be had. We have to make sure we understand why we are putting all of these products on the market and the effect they are going to have on the public. That is another topic we hope to address also as this bill comes to the floor. The bottom line is that I am pleased the Senate is working in a bipartisan manner.

I believe my amendments will strengthen this bill, but I also believe more needs to be done. We must provide the critical resources needed to stem this tide.

That is more people than we have in any city in the State of West Virginia. This bill is an important first step. First of all, it will authorize $77.9 million in grant funding for prevention and recovery efforts. It will expand prevention and educational efforts--particularly aimed at teens, parents and other caretakers, and aging populations--to prevent the abuse of opioids and heroin and to promote treatment and recovery. It will expand the availability of naloxone to law enforcement agencies and other first responders to help in the reversal of overdoses to save lives. It will expand disposable sites for unwanted prescription medications to keep them out of the hands of our children and adolescents. It will launch an evidence-based opioid and heroin treatment and intervention program to expand best practices throughout the country. It will also strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs to help States monitor and track prescription drug diversion. While this bill is a good start and addresses critical problems, there is more that needs to be done. I will be offering several amendments to improve the bill by changing the FDA's mission, providing grants for consumer education, and requiring prescriber training. I firmly believe we need cultural change at the FDA, and that is why I introduced Changing the Culture of the FDA Act. It simply does exactly what it says--it changes that culture. My amendment to CARA, based on the Changing the Culture of the FDA Act, would amend the FDA's mission statement to include language that will require the agency to take into account the public health impact of the Nation's opioid epidemic when approving and regulating opioid medications and will hold the agency responsible for addressing the opioid epidemic. It is hard to believe that right now as all of these new drugs are coming to the market and all of these pharmaceutical manufacturers are producing this new product, basically the mission statement has never taken into account the impact of the opioid epidemic on the public's health in this Nation. Now that we see it is truly an epidemic, we think this is a much needed change, and hopefully it will be approved. This builds on and solidifies the FDA's recently stated goal to fundamentally reexamine the risk-benefit calculations for opioids and ensures that the agency considers the wider public health effects. We need a change in the culture of the FDA, but we also need to make sure the advocacy groups that fight this battle every day are armed with the resources they need to stem this tide. I am also submitting an amendment that will establish consumer education grants through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to raise awareness about the risk of opioid addiction and overdose. This epidemic is one that needs to be fought on all fronts, but most importantly, we need to fight it on the frontlines with the prescribers, those people whom we trust to get the training they need. That is why I will also submit an amendment that will require that medical practitioners receive the needed training on the safe prescribing of opioids prior to renewing their DEA registration to prescribe controlled substances. If you talk to any of our medical physicians throughout the country, they get very little training as far as the effects of these drugs, and we think it is well past time that they get the needed education, as well as continuing education, so that we can keep ahead of the prescriptions they are putting on the markets and basically keep them from harming people every day. According to the National Institutes of Health, in 2012, more than 250 million prescriptions were written in the United States for opioid painkillers. That equals one bottle of pain pills for every U.S. adult. Can you imagine one bottle of pain pills for every U.S. adult in this country? It is unbelievable. We are the most addictive Nation on Earth. Five percent of the population in the United States of America--there are 330 million of us and 700 billion humans on the planet Earth-- consumes 80 percent of the opioids in the world. It is just unheard of. Until we ensure that every prescriber has a strong understanding of safe opioid prescribing practices and the very great risk of opioid addiction, abuse, and overdose deaths, we will continue to see too many people prescribed too many of these dangerous [[Page S1068]] drugs which can lead them down a tragic path, and that is why we need to educate people. There is one other subject I wanted to address, and I hope the FDA and this administration will look at it very seriously, and that is the professionals on advisory committees. When an opioid is coming to market, I believe and I believe a lot of Americans believe that this goes through a review process. These professionals basically are looking at this, and they make a recommendation as to whether this drug should be on the market, the need for this drug, and the effect this drug will have on people's lives. If they rule against this drug--and let's say they have an 11-to-2 ruling, such as Zohydro did--then the request for that drug to come to market should have to come before Congress. The FDA--the director and the staff--needs to basically come and explain to Congress why this potent drug needs to come on the market when basically their advisory committee and those people who are the professionals basically agree not to let it come to market. This is a conversation that has to be had. We have to make sure we understand why we are putting all of these products on the market and the effect they are going to have on the public. That is another topic we hope to address also as this bill comes to the floor. The bottom line is that I am pleased the Senate is working in a bipartisan manner. This is how we need to work to solve the major challenges our country faces. By working in a bipartisan way, we will have, as I understand, an open amendment process which is so needed and critical to move this legislation through. I appreciate that. I believe my amendments will strengthen this bill, but I also believe more needs to be done. We must provide the critical resources needed to stem this tide. I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen this bill and to begin to address this crisis head-on. This country has faced every crisis we have ever had, and we have overcome it. This is one we haven't attempted. For some reason, it is a silent killer--out of sight, out of mind. It will take all of us being Americans and basically using our faith that we have that we can fix these problems, to save Democrats, save Republicans, save Independents, and save everybody. This cannot be a partisan issue because I can tell my colleagues that opiates and the addiction of opiates have no partisan home. It is truly bipartisan. It attacks us all. I appreciate my colleagues, and I look forward to working with them to work through this important piece of legislation. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,21718,21718,21788,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1065-s1068] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] comprehensive addiction and recovery bill mrs. capito. madam president, as we are all sadly aware, the united states is experiencing an epidemic of drug overdose deaths. the statistics are just startling. since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137 percent, including a 200-percent increase in overdose deaths attributed to the use of opioids. west virginia has the unfortunate distinction of leading the nation in drug-related overdose deaths--more than twice the national average. as i travel across the state, i hear constantly about the devastation caused by this epidemic. west virginia communities are grappling with the seriousness and pain of addiction. no family or community--mine included--is immune from this pain. as one of my constituents put it, ``we must give our young people a reason not to start using something that robs them of everything they have.'' other west virginians have bravely shared their family's stories of addiction's pain with me. in the powerful words of one of my constituents, ``it only takes a few seconds to use drugs--but a lifetime to fight.'' drug addiction is a diseases that knows no boundaries, and west virginia is certainly not alone in this fight. my colleagues in the senate--including, i am sure, the acting president pro tempore--return each week with similar stories. no matter our political party, we should all agree on one thing, we must act to change these horrifying statistics and to save lives. some steps have already been taken to address this drug epidemic. the appropriations bill we passed last december included funding to expand prevention efforts. it included improved data collection and new treatment services, training for our servicemembers who [[page s1066]] are battling addiction, and training for the first responders who are responding to these drug overdoses. today we hope to begin debate on the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. i thank my colleagues senator portman, senator ayotte, and senator whitehouse for their leadership on this important legislation. this bipartisan bill, known as cara, addresses the opioid epidemic by expanding prevention and education. it also promotes the resources needed for treatment and recovery. it includes reforms to help law enforcement respond to the drug epidemic, and it supports long-term recovery efforts--which, as we see in my state of west virginia, we don't have enough treatment options, particularly in the long-term recovery area. the legislation also expands the availability of naloxone, a lifesaving drug that helps to reverse the effects of an overdose, and we are also creating disposal sites for unwanted prescriptions. cara provides resources for treatment alternatives to incarceration, such as the successful and expanding drug court programs that operate in west virginia and many other states. we just had a graduation the other day with some great success stories included in that from the drug court. according to the beckley register herald, counties with drug courts have already seen cost savings and deep declines of recidivism rates among graduates. cara also provides a provision to improve treatment programs for pregnant women and mothers who have substance abuse disorder. another startling statistic is the number of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome that has increased fivefold from the years 2000 to the year 2012. last fall, i introduced the improving treatment for pregnant and postpartum women act, with senators ayotte, whitehouse, and klobuchar. the cara act provides a provision that could play a critical role in preventing neonatal abstinence syndrome and getting treatment to pregnant women and new mothers. also, last fall i worked with senator markey and others to help restore drug take-back days and keep medications out of the wrong hands. we all probably have some medication in our own medicine chests that are no longer necessary and that we don't need to have. it might have been for a family member. it is time to clean out those medicine chests. i participated in last year's program in charleston, wv, and was pleased to see the overwhelming response. cara focuses on the programs that work and will streamline efforts across multiple federal agencies. in order to further address the needs of our communities, i am working on several bipartisan amendments on this bill. these amendments include solutions to improve prescribing practices and prevent overprescribing. too many stories of addiction start with patients taking painkillers after a minor surgery or a minor injury. that is why i am pleased to be working with senator gillibrand on an effort that would require clear cdc guidelines for prescribing opioids for acute pain--a tooth extraction, maybe a broken arm, something that doesn't last forever, but the pain is acute in the beginning but fades rather quickly. i also am pleased to be working with senator warren on an amendment that allows doctors to partially fill certain opioid prescriptions. these will reduce the number of unused painkillers sitting in our medicine cabinets and help to prevent future cases of drug abuse and addiction. in order to reduce the number of overdose deaths, i am working with senator kaine to allow doctors to coprescribe the lifesaving drug naloxone when they prescribe an opioid. this would make naloxone more widely available in federal health care settings, such as community health centers, va clinics, and dod facilities. i am also focused on tackling one of the saddest realities of this epidemic. in my state of west virginia, babies born exposed to opioids during pregnancy are approximately three times the national average. every 25 minutes in this country a baby is born with addiction. nationwide, this condition has increased fivefold from the years 2000 to 2012. this amendment will provide clear guidelines to encourage the creation of residential pediatric recovery centers, like the wonderful lily's place in huntington, wv. i am pleased to be working with senator king from maine and congressman evan jenkins from west virginia on this effort. cara represents a positive step forward in addressing the opioid crisis. the four amendments that i have outlined, i believe, will strengthen the bill. they would prevent addiction, promote recovery, and curb the scourge of drug addiction in my state and in others across this country. there is much work ahead for all of us in this area. the actions we are hopefully taking here this week in washington are simply first steps. this bill builds on the tireless work being done at the state and local levels by communities, law enforcement, and health professionals all across this country. they are working together. by working together, we can change these statistics and stop more tragedies from occurring--stop the human tragedy of losing a loved one, of losing a mother or father. i urge my colleagues to begin debate on cara this evening and to support this important legislation. i am concerned we are in jeopardy of losing the next generation. so we have much work to do. the acting president pro tempore. the senator from texas. mr. cornyn. madam president, as we have heard from the senator from west virginia, this week the senate will begin consideration of a bipartisan bill that targets an epidemic that is raging across the country, but apparently it is especially hard-hitting in places such as west virginia, ohio, pennsylvania, and the like. but this abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin is not just isolated to those areas, even though the leaders of this particular legislation come from places such as minnesota, rhode island, ohio, and new hampshire. sadly, texas has been no exception. the centers for disease control and prevention found that in texas opioid-related drug deaths have increased by 30 percent since 2002. houston is widely recognized by the dea and law enforcement officials as a key hub for the trafficking of illicit prescription drugs. in south texas, right next to the u.s.-mexico border, the transnational criminal organizations are exploiting our porous border to import increasingly large amounts of hard narcotics like heroin, which ultimately wreaks havoc in towns and cities across america. in 2014 alone, drug cartels successfully smuggled more than 250,000 pounds of heroin across our borders and into the united states at a street value of approximately $25 billion. these are the same criminals who traffic in human beings, including young girls and boys. these are the same people who traffic in illegal immigrants. these are the same people who traffic in illegal drugs. indeed, this has become such big business and the network so large that these transnational criminal organizations are basically in on everything and anything that will make them money, including transporting these terrible drugs like heroin across the border. as we all know and have heard, this epidemic destroys families, it increases the crime rate, and it robs millions of americans of their future. as i mentioned a moment ago, thousands are dying every year. that is why the bill we are voting on this afternoon, called the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, is so important. it will help give families and law enforcement additional resources to beat drug addiction through proven treatment programs. i am proud to cosponsor the legislation. the reason we have been able to move this bill forward so far--and it passed unanimously out of the senate judiciary committee 2 weeks ago-- is because it reflects bipartisan input as well as bipartisan concern with this epidemic. as i mentioned earlier, i wish to particularly recognize the junior senators from rhode island, new hampshire, and ohio--senators whitehouse, portman, and ayotte--for their laserlike focus on this legislation and making sure that it is at the top of our list of things we need to do this legislative session. by highlighting how bad the problem is in our country and providing legislation to address it, they [[page s1067]] are helping us attack this epidemic head-on. i must say that while so far this legislation has moved forward on a strong bipartisan basis, there are some signals on the horizon that indicate some potential trouble. at a press conference after the judiciary committee unanimously passed the bill, several of our friends on the other side of the aisle were explicit. they said that if the senate did not add hundreds of millions of dollars in duplicative funding, they might withhold their support. this legislation is an authorization bill, and it does not appropriate funds. our friends across the aisle know that if an appropriation is added to this legislation, particularly if it is duplicative, it causes a number of problems. first of all, a spending bill can't originate here in the senate. so it raises a so-called blue- slip problem. but perhaps just as importantly, this is not an orderly process by which we determine what is actually needed and to make sure that we are appropriating money in a fiscally responsible sort of way. i don't have to remind the acting president pro tempore or anybody else who is listening that we have a $19 trillion debt in our country, and recklessly throwing money at a problem rather than carefully targeting it in a fiscally responsible way is simply irresponsible. it seems to be part of the message: give us what we want or we might hijack a bipartisan bill that would literally save lives. i hope i am wrong, and i hope the signals on the horizon don't prove to ultimately be true. but it does seem like this is part of a new political strategy. earlier this month, we know that our democrat colleagues blocked a bipartisan energy bill from moving forward on an unrelated issue-- something on which senator murkowski has shown the patience of job, trying to work through this process so we can get back on the energy bill rather than having it hijacked by an extraneous subject that could well and should well be handled in a different way, certainly separately. this is not the way the senate gets anything accomplished. as i have said before, playing political games with important issues like fighting drug addiction is what lost our friends the majority in 2014. i urge the democratic leadership to listen to those in their own caucus who have worked alongside republicans in a responsible fashion to draft and put forward this bill that is so clearly needed in this country. this afternoon i hope we will move forward on the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. i hope we will consider it and consider amendments that are being offered in good faith on both sides to try to improve the legislation. but what we should not do is allow anyone to hijack this important legislation for partisan purposes. i think we should restrain ourselves from any impulse to do so. it happened, unfortunately, on the bipartisan energy bill. it has been threatened on this legislation. but my hope is that cooler heads will prevail. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the acting president pro tempore. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. manchin. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the acting president pro tempore. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. manchin. madam president, i rise today to speak in support of the comprehensive addiction and recovery act of 2015, also known as the cara act. our country is facing a prescription drug epidemic, and today is a good step toward addressing this crisis. this is a crisis i have been dealing with since my days as governor of the great state of west virginia. opioid abuse is not only ravaging my state, it is ravaging the country. drug overdose deaths have soared by more than 700 percent since 1999. we lost 600 west virginians to opioids last year alone. but our state is not unique; every day in our country, 51 americans die from opioid abuse, and since 1999 we have lost almost 200,000 americans to prescription opioid abuse. think about that. that is more people than we have in any city in the state of west virginia. this bill is an important first step. first of all, it will authorize $77.9 million in grant funding for prevention and recovery efforts. it will expand prevention and educational efforts--particularly aimed at teens, parents and other caretakers, and aging populations--to prevent the abuse of opioids and heroin and to promote treatment and recovery. it will expand the availability of naloxone to law enforcement agencies and other first responders to help in the reversal of overdoses to save lives. it will expand disposable sites for unwanted prescription medications to keep them out of the hands of our children and adolescents. it will launch an evidence-based opioid and heroin treatment and intervention program to expand best practices throughout the country. it will also strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs to help states monitor and track prescription drug diversion. while this bill is a good start and addresses critical problems, there is more that needs to be done. i will be offering several amendments to improve the bill by changing the fda's mission, providing grants for consumer education, and requiring prescriber training. i firmly believe we need cultural change at the fda, and that is why i introduced changing the culture of the fda act. it simply does exactly what it says--it changes that culture. my amendment to cara, based on the changing the culture of the fda act, would amend the fda's mission statement to include language that will require the agency to take into account the public health impact of the nation's opioid epidemic when approving and regulating opioid medications and will hold

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1068,CREC-2016-02-29,114,WOMEN'S RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1068-S1069] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WOMEN'S RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this week the Supreme Court--which is lacking a ninth Justice for the foreseeable future for reasons that most of the American public doesn't understand since my fellow Senators--my Republican colleagues--simply refuse to do their job--will hear arguments on yet another case that threatens women's right to health care. The case the Supreme Court will hear on Wednesday--Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt--originated in Texas, but, as all Supreme Court cases do, this case has implications for the entire country. It is part of a sustained, coordinated attack on women's right to make personal, private health care decisions for themselves. It is Big Government reaching into women's homes and bedrooms, getting between the women and their health care providers, between the women and their religious counselors; it is reaching into women's homes, telling women that they no longer have the right to make personal, private health care decisions for themselves and to access safe and affordable care. If the Court rules in favor of the Texas law, which has closed health clinics across the State--imagine that. You are a legislator taking an oath of office in Austin, TX, to do the best you can for your State, and you pass legislation that closes health clinics not for financial reasons but for ideological reasons. So if the Court rules in favor of this Texas law, which, as I said, closes health clinics across the State, it will set a dangerous precedent that could lead to more clinic closures across this country. My interest is especially Ohio. Ohio will be weakened by this too. These clinics are often the only place women and men have to turn for their basic health services. Most of the health care women are getting at these clinics has nothing to do with abortions, but it is the kind of care that women need in these clinics. Millions of women rely on Planned Parenthood and other clinics like it for lifesaving screenings, for testing, for preventive care, and for treatment. In Ohio, Planned Parenthood centers provide health care services to 100,000 men and women each year. Many of them have nowhere else to turn. Many of them are moderate-income women. Many of them are women working two jobs. Many of them go to Planned Parenthood because, first, it gives good care; second, it takes care of them in kind, decent, empathetic ways; and third, it is what they can afford. They either cannot afford health care elsewhere or they live too far away to have access to health care. A new law in Ohio threatens that access. The bill was passed by the Ohio Legislature and signed by Governor Kasich--that is Governor Kasich of Presidential primary fame, Presidential Republican debate fame. The bill, which was signed by Governor Kasich a week ago, will strip Federal funding not only from Planned Parenthood--why they would want to do that is all about ideology and playing to their far-right political base--will strip Federal funding not only from Planned Parenthood but any health care facility that could be perceived as ``promoting'' safe and legal abortion. But these health care clinics are mostly not about abortion; they are about providing health care to women--mostly to women. This includes health clinics that simply work with other providers to refer women to other facilities so that women can make decisions that should be between them and their doctors. Now, I repeat, so many of my colleagues love to talk about Big Government, but when Big Government--mostly a bunch of privileged--if I may, privileged, White men on the other side of the aisle, mostly--when they want to inject themselves between women and their doctors, between women and their families, between women and their religious counselors, it strikes me as--let's just say hypocritical. We are talking about a rule that is far, far more sweeping than just defunding--that is what they like to say, ``defunding''--Planned Parenthood. If you are watching the Republican debates week after week, even when they sound like food fights, which it did last week--when you are watching these debates, you can see that whenever one of these White, privileged men--candidates running for President and one other privileged African-American man running for President on the Republican side--whenever they say ``defund Planned Parenthood,'' the crowd goes wild. They play to that base to defund Planned Parenthood, that base that for whatever reason, with their ideological agenda, doesn't seem to care much about women's health. Let's be clear. This isn't about defunding abortion. The Federal Government doesn't provide funding for abortion, period. I will say that again. The Federal Government does not provide funding for abortion, period. Health officials in Ohio--health officials that play it straight, which is 99-point-something percent of providers--real doctors, real health providers, real health care officials are scared that the new law could take funding away from local health departments, if we can imagine that. The director of public health policy in Columbus--the State's capital--told the Columbus Dispatch that the law would have a ``significant impact'' on their department's ability to coordinate with hospitals and insurance companies. [[Page S1069]] So stand back for a second and see what they are doing. A bunch of rightwing, privileged, mostly White men in the legislature have decided that their political agenda trumps everything else, and they are willing to follow their--so that they can play to their far-right base, they are willing to jeopardize women's health. They are willing to go right up against what the Columbus Dispatch says--few papers in America are more conservative--when they talk about a significant impact on the department's ability to coordinate with hospitals and insurance companies. Why would they do that? They do it because they are playing to this far-right base who votes overwhelmingly in primaries. The director said that because the bill is so broadly written, ``we wouldn't be able to work with any hospital in our jurisdiction.'' This Ohio law explicitly targets critical health and health education services for women. Don't take my word for it; all you have to do is read the bill. This chart shows that it prohibits Ohio clinics and hospitals from using Federal dollars--and I am quoting directly from the bill--for any of the programs established by the Violence Against Women Act, the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Infertility Prevention Project, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, and the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act. Think about that--the Mortality Prevention Act. This bill prohibits Ohio clinics and hospitals from using Federal dollars to implement these laws. It means no Federal dollars for the program administered by the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services to educate adolescents on abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. So this legislation that Governor Kasich signed that these privileged, mostly White men in the State legislature--politically far to the right, the majority of the State legislature--the bill they passed and Governor Kasich signed would mean that we wouldn't be able to use the Federal dollars we have to educate adolescents on abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. So what are they doing? The extremists on the other side are saying no Federal dollars for abortion. There aren't Federal dollars for abortion. But they are saying no Federal dollars to preach abstinence and to educate young people about abstinence and sexually transmitted diseases. So what are they doing and why are they doing this to the women in Ohio? This law bars women from accessing cancer screenings, fertility services, AIDS prevention, and help coping with abuse and violence. Do these far-right members of the legislature know no low-income or moderate-income young women? Do they know no teenagers, no female teenagers and young male teenagers, too, who maybe could benefit from some of these programs, including abstinence education, learning about contraceptives, and learning about how sexually transmitted diseases are in fact transmitted? I support a woman's right to make personal, private health care decisions for herself with her doctor. But no matter your personal feelings about abortion, surely we can agree--although the legislature can't in my State--surely we can agree that cancer screenings and programs that have helped bring Ohio's teen pregnancy and STD rates down are a good thing. I would say that Ohio right now--and this is embarrassing for me to say on the Senate floor in front of colleagues--my State is 50th for Black babies and infant mortality and 47th overall in infant mortality. We are 47th overall, 50th for Black infant mortality. The legislature underfunds public health, and they then undercut-- because of this legislature's action with Governor Kasich's signature-- they undercut the Violence Against Women Act, they undercut minority HIV and AIDS education, they undercut the personal responsibility education program, they undercut breast and cervical cancer mortality prevention, and they undercut infertility prevention projects. I just don't get it. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BROWN. A woman in New Carlisle wrote to me saying: There was a time when I could not find full-time employment, I did not have health insurance, and I also was not eligible for any assistance from the government. My husband and I were newly married and trying to build a responsible life together. I was 21. I had a family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, so access to healthcare was crucial for me. Planned Parenthood was the only place that would help me look after my health and plan my own family and lifestyle in a way that I could afford. Another woman went on to say: ``Planned Parenthood made an impoverished young woman feel safe and comfortable and valued.'' Another woman in Boardman, OH, wrote: ``Along with many other women, I was treated at Planned Parenthood, and I received a referral to a specialist, which saved my reproduction.'' Another woman wrote saying that she had a child at 13 and gave up the child for adoption. After that she made the choice to get educated about family planning and birth control. She couldn't afford to go to a family doctor, so Planned Parenthood was where she turned to make sure she never had to go through that experience again. A young woman from Columbus told the Canton Repository newspaper that while she was speaking at the statehouse. Half of the lawmakers looked like they were about to fall asleep. Many were looking at their cell phones. They didn't want to listen to a young, low-income woman talk about her personal life and what Planned Parenthood meant to her. What is happening is not all that different in Ohio than across the country. There is an organized attack on women's rights to make health care decisions for themselves. It is not about health or safety. Look at these examples. It is about politicians thinking they know better than women and their doctors. It is happening as we speak. These so- called TRAP laws in Ohio and in dozens of other States have created gaps in care that threaten women's ability to see the providers of their choice. Health clinics in Texas have shut their doors. If the Supreme Court upholds the Texas law being challenged, the remaining clinics in the State may be forced to turn their patients away for good. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1068-S1069] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WOMEN'S RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this week the Supreme Court--which is lacking a ninth Justice for the foreseeable future for reasons that most of the American public doesn't understand since my fellow Senators--my Republican colleagues--simply refuse to do their job--will hear arguments on yet another case that threatens women's right to health care. The case the Supreme Court will hear on Wednesday--Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt--originated in Texas, but, as all Supreme Court cases do, this case has implications for the entire country. It is part of a sustained, coordinated attack on women's right to make personal, private health care decisions for themselves. It is Big Government reaching into women's homes and bedrooms, getting between the women and their health care providers, between the women and their religious counselors; it is reaching into women's homes, telling women that they no longer have the right to make personal, private health care decisions for themselves and to access safe and affordable care. If the Court rules in favor of the Texas law, which has closed health clinics across the State--imagine that. You are a legislator taking an oath of office in Austin, TX, to do the best you can for your State, and you pass legislation that closes health clinics not for financial reasons but for ideological reasons. So if the Court rules in favor of this Texas law, which, as I said, closes health clinics across the State, it will set a dangerous precedent that could lead to more clinic closures across this country. My interest is especially Ohio. Ohio will be weakened by this too. These clinics are often the only place women and men have to turn for their basic health services. Most of the health care women are getting at these clinics has nothing to do with abortions, but it is the kind of care that women need in these clinics. Millions of women rely on Planned Parenthood and other clinics like it for lifesaving screenings, for testing, for preventive care, and for treatment. In Ohio, Planned Parenthood centers provide health care services to 100,000 men and women each year. Many of them have nowhere else to turn. Many of them are moderate-income women. Many of them are women working two jobs. Many of them go to Planned Parenthood because, first, it gives good care; second, it takes care of them in kind, decent, empathetic ways; and third, it is what they can afford. They either cannot afford health care elsewhere or they live too far away to have access to health care. A new law in Ohio threatens that access. The bill was passed by the Ohio Legislature and signed by Governor Kasich--that is Governor Kasich of Presidential primary fame, Presidential Republican debate fame. The bill, which was signed by Governor Kasich a week ago, will strip Federal funding not only from Planned Parenthood--why they would want to do that is all about ideology and playing to their far-right political base--will strip Federal funding not only from Planned Parenthood but any health care facility that could be perceived as ``promoting'' safe and legal abortion. But these health care clinics are mostly not about abortion; they are about providing health care to women--mostly to women. This includes health clinics that simply work with other providers to refer women to other facilities so that women can make decisions that should be between them and their doctors. Now, I repeat, so many of my colleagues love to talk about Big Government, but when Big Government--mostly a bunch of privileged--if I may, privileged, White men on the other side of the aisle, mostly--when they want to inject themselves between women and their doctors, between women and their families, between women and their religious counselors, it strikes me as--let's just say hypocritical. We are talking about a rule that is far, far more sweeping than just defunding--that is what they like to say, ``defunding''--Planned Parenthood. If you are watching the Republican debates week after week, even when they sound like food fights, which it did last week--when you are watching these debates, you can see that whenever one of these White, privileged men--candidates running for President and one other privileged African-American man running for President on the Republican side--whenever they say ``defund Planned Parenthood,'' the crowd goes wild. They play to that base to defund Planned Parenthood, that base that for whatever reason, with their ideological agenda, doesn't seem to care much about women's health. Let's be clear. This isn't about defunding abortion. The Federal Government doesn't provide funding for abortion, period. I will say that again. The Federal Government does not provide funding for abortion, period. Health officials in Ohio--health officials that play it straight, which is 99-point-something percent of providers--real doctors, real health providers, real health care officials are scared that the new law could take funding away from local health departments, if we can imagine that. The director of public health policy in Columbus--the State's capital--told the Columbus Dispatch that the law would have a ``significant impact'' on their department's ability to coordinate with hospitals and insurance companies. [[Page S1069]] So stand back for a second and see what they are doing. A bunch of rightwing, privileged, mostly White men in the legislature have decided that their political agenda trumps everything else, and they are willing to follow their--so that they can play to their far-right base, they are willing to jeopardize women's health. They are willing to go right up against what the Columbus Dispatch says--few papers in America are more conservative--when they talk about a significant impact on the department's ability to coordinate with hospitals and insurance companies. Why would they do that? They do it because they are playing to this far-right base who votes overwhelmingly in primaries. The director said that because the bill is so broadly written, ``we wouldn't be able to work with any hospital in our jurisdiction.'' This Ohio law explicitly targets critical health and health education services for women. Don't take my word for it; all you have to do is read the bill. This chart shows that it prohibits Ohio clinics and hospitals from using Federal dollars--and I am quoting directly from the bill--for any of the programs established by the Violence Against Women Act, the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Infertility Prevention Project, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, and the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act. Think about that--the Mortality Prevention Act. This bill prohibits Ohio clinics and hospitals from using Federal dollars to implement these laws. It means no Federal dollars for the program administered by the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services to educate adolescents on abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. So this legislation that Governor Kasich signed that these privileged, mostly White men in the State legislature--politically far to the right, the majority of the State legislature--the bill they passed and Governor Kasich signed would mean that we wouldn't be able to use the Federal dollars we have to educate adolescents on abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. So what are they doing? The extremists on the other side are saying no Federal dollars for abortion. There aren't Federal dollars for abortion. But they are saying no Federal dollars to preach abstinence and to educate young people about abstinence and sexually transmitted diseases. So what are they doing and why are they doing this to the women in Ohio? This law bars women from accessing cancer screenings, fertility services, AIDS prevention, and help coping with abuse and violence. Do these far-right members of the legislature know no low-income or moderate-income young women? Do they know no teenagers, no female teenagers and young male teenagers, too, who maybe could benefit from some of these programs, including abstinence education, learning about contraceptives, and learning about how sexually transmitted diseases are in fact transmitted? I support a woman's right to make personal, private health care decisions for herself with her doctor. But no matter your personal feelings about abortion, surely we can agree--although the legislature can't in my State--surely we can agree that cancer screenings and programs that have helped bring Ohio's teen pregnancy and STD rates down are a good thing.

i support a woman's right to make personal, private health care decisions for herself with her doctor. but no matter your personal feelings about abortion, surely we can agree--although the legislature can't in my state--surely we can agree that cancer screenings and programs that have helped bring ohio's teen pregnancy and std rates down are a good thing. i would say that ohio right now--and this is embarrassing for me to say on the senate floor in front of colleagues--my state is 50th for black babies and infant mortality and 47th overall in infant mortality. we are 47th overall, 50th for black infant mortality. the legislature underfunds public health, and they then undercut-- because of this legislature's action with governor kasich's signature-- they undercut the violence against women act, they undercut minority hiv and aids education, they undercut the personal responsibility education program, they undercut breast and cervical cancer mortality prevention, and they undercut infertility prevention projects. i just don't get it. the acting president pro tempore. the senator's time has expired. mr. brown. madam president, i ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes. the acting president pro tempore. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. brown. a woman in new carlisle wrote to me saying: there was a time when i could not find full-time employment, i did not have health insurance, and i also was not eligible for any assistance from the government. my husband and i were newly married and trying to build a responsible life together. i was 21. i had a family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, so access to healthcare was crucial for me. planned parenthood was the only place that would help me look after my health and plan my own family and lifestyle in a way that i could afford. another woman went on to say: ``planned parenthood made an impoverished young woman feel safe and comfortable and valued.'' another woman in boardman, oh, wrote: ``along with many other women, i was treated at planned parenthood, and i received a referral to a specialist, which saved my reproduction.'' another woman wrote saying that she had a child at 13 and gave up the child for adoption. after that she made the choice to get educated about family planning and birth control. she couldn't afford to go to a family doctor, so planned parenthood was where she turned to make sure she never had to go through that experience again. a young woman from columbus told the canton repository newspaper that while she was speaking at the statehouse. half of the lawmakers looked like they were about to fall asleep. many were looking at their cell phones. they didn't want to listen to a young, low-income woman talk about her personal life and what planned parenthood meant to her. what is happening is not all that different in ohio than across the country. there is an organized attack on women's rights to make health care decisions for themselves. it is not about health or safety. look at these examples. it is about politicians thinking they know better than women and their doctors. it is happening as we speak. these so- called trap laws in ohio and in dozens of other states have created gaps in care that threaten women's ability to see the providers of their choice. health clinics in texas have shut their doors. if the supreme court upholds the texas law being challenged, the remaining clinics in the state may be forced to turn their patients away for good. ____________________",12096

Madam President, I rise to congratulate Nebraska's beef producers for continuing to reach new areas of the world with our very high-quality American beef. Earlier this month it was announced that WR Reserve, a beef-processing plant in Hastings, NE, will have the honor of delivering the first U.S. shipments to Israel in nearly 13 years. In December 2003, Israel was one of many countries to suspend imports of U.S. beef, following a confirmed case of BSE in the United States. Because of this, America's beef producers have been unable to ship their products to this close friend and ally. However, during my visit to Israel last fall, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro asked me to begin a dialogue with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and find a way to bring Nebraska beef to Israel. The Ambassador was especially interested in serving that Nebraska beef at the Embassy's annual 4th of July celebration. Over the last few months, I have worked with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service and with officials at the Nebraska Department of Agriculture in a concerted effort to find a solution. I am extremely pleased to inform this body that an agreement was achieved, the ban was lifted, and Nebraska will supply the first shipments of beef to Israel in over a decade. Ambassador Shapiro was quick to praise this breakthrough, noting: This agreement gives Israeli consumers access to the world's highest-quality beef. At the same time, it creates and supports jobs in the great state of Nebraska. I couldn't agree with the Ambassador more. Israel is a critical ally of the United States, and I was pleased to work with the USDA and the Israeli Government to supply the first American beef shipments to Israel in over a decade. Nebraska's beef producers are the best in the world, and this agreement is a testament to their tireless commitment to delivering safe and high-quality beef to millions of dinner tables around the world. In Nebraska, cattle outnumber people more than 3 to 1. With nearly $7.2 billion in annual cash receipts, our beef production is the largest sector of the State's economy, and Nebraska leads the Nation in every aspect of beef production. I would also like to note that this agreement shows that science-based trade can overcome myth and misinformation. By ending this ban, Israel becomes one of the last countries to reopen its market to U.S. beef and abide by international trade regulations. In doing so, this agreement reinforces the progress made by the U.S. beef industry to eliminate BSE-related trade restrictions. I also join the Nebraska Agriculture Department director, Greg Ibach, in congratulating WR Reserve. Their hard work made this agreement possible after complying with a rigorous inspection process that included regular visits from the Israeli Government. Prior to this agreement, according to the USDA, Israel imported beef products from other nations worth $405 million in 2014. Ninety-five percent of these imports originated in Latin America with smaller volumes coming from Australia and the European Union. Now the United States will have the opportunity to showcase our world-famous beef to a new global market, and Nebraska is very proud to lead that charge. I was honored to work collaboratively with State, Federal, and international officials to ensure that Nebraska's beef producers achieved those necessary approvals. [[Page S1072]] I am proud to represent the people of Nebraska. Through this agreement, new markets are now open to Nebraska's producers, businesses, and to the communities that rely on them for economic progress.

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1072,CREC-2016-02-29,114,TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1072-S1073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES Phil Nowak Mr. CARPER. Madam President, last month I came to the floor--in fact, I come to the floor just about every month--to highlight the great work being done by the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. Last month I focused on the folks who work at FEMA, which is one of 22 agencies that collectively make up the Department of Homeland Security--the newest, youngest Department in the Federal Government. Just a few days before my speech, much of the east coast was inundated, as you may recall, by one of the largest snowstorms we have had in a long time, and on that day FEMA was working around the clock to prepare for and respond to what could have been a much more devastating storm. We were hit hard, but we would have been a lot worse off if not for the preparation and the training FEMA had done in not just the days, weeks, and months, but literally years ahead leading up to the storm in order to make us better prepared. For more than a year now, I have come to the floor and I have focused on a different agency within the Department of Homeland Security. It will take about 2 years to knock them all out, but we are making some progress, and I have done so to highlight the exemplary and important work done by more than some 200,000 people who comprise the Department of Homeland Security. They work around the country, and they work outside our country--in Mexico, Central America, South America, Europe, and all over the place in order to make us safer in this country. These men and women perform a wide range of vitally important work, and they do it every day. They inspect the fruit and vegetables that arrive at our ports of entry, much like the Port of Wilmington in my State. It is the top banana port in the country. They patrol our borders, like the Border Patrol agents dealing with increased migration from Central America. They defend our computer networks in cyber space, responding to a new and growing 21st-century threat. They keep our Presidents and Vice Presidents and their families and former Presidents and their families, as well as candidates for those positions, along with visiting foreign dignitaries, safe from harm. They have a lot of work to do. The work of these DHS personnel deployed at the frontlines is made possible in part because of the dedicated work of the men and women behind the scenes at the Department of Homeland Security's Management Directorate. As my colleagues have often heard me say, management really does matter. I will say it again: Management really does matter. And there are few places where that is more true than at the Department of Homeland Security. The Management Directorate works to support the missions and employees of all 22 component agencies which together comprise the Department of Homeland Security. They rent field offices, they buy essential equipment and vehicles, and they help to ensure that Department employees receive the paychecks and benefits they have worked for and earned. Within the Management Directorate, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer works to ensure that the Department is doing what is best for its employees, while providing the Department managers with the guidance and resources they need to help DHS take care of their own. One member of the Management Directorate is an especially committed fellow whose name is Phil Nowak. He is committed to DHS employees--his fellow colleagues. He is the Chief of Staff in the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. Phil grew up not in Iowa or Delaware, he grew up in San Francisco, not far from where I served in the Navy for a while. He joined the U.S. Coast Guard right after college. After serving in the Coast Guard for 20 years, he retired as a commander. I was once a commander--my favorite rank. Both of us served and exchange salutes all the time, Madam President. But Phil retired as a commander in 2007 and joined the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help coordinate disaster response. In 2010 Phil moved to the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, and in 2013 he took over as Chief of Staff. As Chief of Staff, Phil supports the work of the Chief Human Capital Officer in managing the workforce of the third largest Cabinet agency in our Federal Government--the third largest. With 22 component agencies and DHS employees stationed literally around the world, Phil and his team of 200 men and women certainly have their work cut out for them. Supporting the Department employees and providing them with the resources they need to excel and grow in their work is critical to maintaining a motivated, effective, and capable Department. With some notable exceptions, we know many of the components of this relatively young Department have struggled with employee morale almost from its inception. Each year the Partnership for Public Service releases its ``Best Places to Work in the Federal Government'' survey, and each year the Department of Homeland Security ranks at or near the bottom of all the agencies when it comes to overall employee morale. With Congress imposing shortsighted budget cuts across government, imposing pay freezes, and just last week threatening a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security in the middle of our fight against ISIS, it is no wonder that sometimes DHS employees feel unappreciated. We probably would too. Despite these setbacks, leaders such as Phil Nowak are working every day and every night to right the ship and improve morale at DHS. And a bunch of us here in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, are trying to be helpful in that regard. In providing leadership and direction for human capital management for the Department, Phil Nowak makes sure that the Department's efforts to improve morale translate to each of the 22 different component agencies of the Department of Homeland Security and are felt by each of its 240,000 employees. To help do this, Secretary Jeh Johnson has created what he calls a Unity of Effort Initiative to bring the Department of Homeland Security components together and make the Department greater than the sum of its parts. Phil leads one of the Unity of Effort Initiatives. It is called the Human Capital Leadership Council, which brings together human resources managers from across the Department. Through this coordination and other Unity of Effort Initiatives, Phil's team works hard to better ensure that the Department's 240,000 employees feel like part of a larger DHS family. In such a large agency, with so many people with diverse talents and backgrounds spread around the world, it is easy to focus on the broader mission and lose sight of the individuals who help the Department achieves its many missions, but Phil, I am happy to say, hasn't lost sight of them. Phil and his team do yeomen's work, and they focus on the value that each and every employee adds to the Department's mission. It is fitting, then, that Phil's colleagues describe him as caring deeply for them and for other employees throughout the Department. His commitment to them is clear, it is welcome, and it is unwavering. In his own life, Phil values professional resilience, and in a job that is sometimes overlooked, yet incredibly important, I think that is a necessary trait. It is also a fitting quality for a runner, and Phil is an avid runner. I like to run, but this man, Madam President is the real deal. He has completed both the Marine Corps Marathon and the JFK 50 Mile ultra-marathon [[Page S1073]] twice. I am not fit to carry his running shoes. When he isn't running, Phil is building or fixing something around the house, cheering on those San Francisco 49ers and the San Francisco Giants--I hope it is not when they are playing my Detroit Tigers--and spending time with his wife of 26 years, Cristy, and their three children, Sam, Elizabeth, and Andrew. We are grateful to them for sharing their husband and their dad. Phil Nowak is just one example of the thousands of men and women at the Department of Homeland Security who work behind the scenes every day to support their colleagues and make our country safer for all of us. Phil and his team focus on individuals, they bring together components through a unity of effort, and they work tirelessly to improve employee morale. Management really does matter, and without Phil and his colleagues at the Management Directorate, the Department's mission to protect our homeland would suffer. To Phil Nowak and to his team in the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, to every other hard-working employee at the Department of Homeland Security and at the Directorate for Management, I want to say a couple of words: Thank you. Let me say them again: Thank you. This past week I was doing some traveling and going through some airports. We usually try to use the TSA precheck, which goes a little more smoothly because people have been prescreened. At one place we were flying out of, they advertised TSA precheck was open, but it wasn't, so we had to be regular, ordinary people. At each of those places, the folks at TSA--right there at the frontline trying to protect us as we fly around the country, around the world in these airplanes--they were doing their job. It is a hard job, and I would say probably a thankless job. Everyone wants to get through. They do not want to take their shoes off or their belts off or have to take their toiletries out. They want to get through there, get on the plane, and go someplace, but not get harmed and arrive safely. When I fly, a lot of times I will tell the folks at TSA who I am and the committee I serve on just to let them know we appreciate the work they do for all of us. Every now and then--including over the weekend-- a TSA officer will say to me: Nobody has ever thanked me before. How about that. Nobody has ever thanked me before. So I say: Well, let me thank you again. And keep doing your job well, and hopefully you will get a lot of thanks. But to all the folks at DHS who are taking on a hard job and doing it well, we thank you for what you do every day to protect our country, the land of the free and the home of the brave. And may God bless you. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1072-S1073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES Phil Nowak Mr. CARPER.

With some notable exceptions, we know many of the components of this relatively young Department have struggled with employee morale almost from its inception. Each year the Partnership for Public Service releases its ``Best Places to Work in the Federal Government'' survey, and each year the Department of Homeland Security ranks at or near the bottom of all the agencies when it comes to overall employee morale. With Congress imposing shortsighted budget cuts across government, imposing pay freezes, and just last week threatening a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security in the middle of our fight against ISIS, it is no wonder that sometimes DHS employees feel unappreciated. We probably would too. Despite these setbacks, leaders such as Phil Nowak are working every day and every night to right the ship and improve morale at DHS. And a bunch of us here in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, are trying to be helpful in that regard. In providing leadership and direction for human capital management for the Department, Phil Nowak makes sure that the Department's efforts to improve morale translate to each of the 22 different component agencies of the Department of Homeland Security and are felt by each of its 240,000 employees. To help do this, Secretary Jeh Johnson has created what he calls a Unity of Effort Initiative to bring the Department of Homeland Security components together and make the Department greater than the sum of its parts. Phil leads one of the Unity of Effort Initiatives. It is called the Human Capital Leadership Council, which brings together human resources managers from across the Department. Through this coordination and other Unity of Effort Initiatives, Phil's team works hard to better ensure that the Department's 240,000 employees feel like part of a larger DHS family. In such a large agency, with so many people with diverse talents and backgrounds spread around the world, it is easy to focus on the broader mission and lose sight of the individuals who help the Department achieves its many missions, but Phil, I am happy to say, hasn't lost sight of them. Phil and his team do yeomen's work, and they focus on the value that each and every employee adds to the Department's mission. It is fitting, then, that Phil's colleagues describe him as caring deeply for them and for other employees throughout the Department. His commitment to them is clear, it is welcome, and it is unwavering. In his own life, Phil values professional resilience, and in a job that is sometimes overlooked, yet incredibly important, I think that is a necessary trait. It is also a fitting quality for a runner, and Phil is an avid runner. I like to run, but this man, Madam President is the real deal. He has completed both the Marine Corps Marathon and the JFK 50 Mile ultra-marathon [[Page S1073]] twice. I am not fit to carry his running shoes. When he isn't running, Phil is building or fixing something around the house, cheering on those San Francisco 49ers and the San Francisco Giants--I hope it is not when they are playing my Detroit Tigers--and spending time with his wife of 26 years, Cristy, and their three children, Sam, Elizabeth, and Andrew. We are grateful to them for sharing their husband and their dad. Phil Nowak is just one example of the thousands of men and women at the Department of Homeland Security who work behind the scenes every day to support their colleagues and make our country safer for all of us. Phil and his team focus on individuals, they bring together components through a unity of effort, and they work tirelessly to improve employee morale. Management really does matter, and without Phil and his colleagues at the Management Directorate, the Department's mission to protect our homeland would suffer. To Phil Nowak and to his team in the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, to every other hard-working employee at the Department of Homeland Security and at the Directorate for Management, I want to say a couple of words: Thank you. Let me say them again: Thank you. This past week I was doing some traveling and going through some airports. We usually try to use the TSA precheck, which goes a little more smoothly because people have been prescreened. At one place we were flying out of, they advertised TSA precheck was open, but it wasn't, so we had to be regular, ordinary people. At each of those places, the folks at TSA--right there at the frontline trying to protect us as we fly around the country, around the world in these airplanes--they were doing their job. It is a hard job, and I would say probably a thankless job. Everyone wants to get through. They do not want to take their shoes off or their belts off or have to take their toiletries out. They want to get through there, get on the plane, and go someplace, but not get harmed and arrive safely. When I fly, a lot of times I will tell the folks at TSA who I am and the committee I serve on just to let them know we appreciate the work they do for all of us. Every now and then--including over the weekend-- a TSA officer will say to me: Nobody has ever thanked me before. How about that. Nobody has ever thanked me before. So I say: Well, let me thank you again. And keep doing your job well, and hopefully you will get a lot of thanks. But to all the folks at DHS who are taking on a hard job and doing it well, we thank you for what you do every day to protect our country, the land of the free and the home of the brave. And may God bless you. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1072-S1073] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES Phil Nowak Mr. CARPER. Madam President, last month I came to the floor--in fact, I come to the floor just about every month--to highlight the great work being done by the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. Last month I focused on the folks who work at FEMA, which is one of 22 agencies that collectively make up the Department of Homeland Security--the newest, youngest Department in the Federal Government. Just a few days before my speech, much of the east coast was inundated, as you may recall, by one of the largest snowstorms we have had in a long time, and on that day FEMA was working around the clock to prepare for and respond to what could have been a much more devastating storm. We were hit hard, but we would have been a lot worse off if not for the preparation and the training FEMA had done in not just the days, weeks, and months, but literally years ahead leading up to the storm in order to make us better prepared. For more than a year now, I have come to the floor and I have focused on a different agency within the Department of Homeland Security. It will take about 2 years to knock them all out, but we are making some progress, and I have done so to highlight the exemplary and important work done by more than some 200,000 people who comprise the Department of Homeland Security. They work around the country, and they work outside our country--in Mexico, Central America, South America, Europe, and all over the place in order to make us safer in this country. These men and women perform a wide range of vitally important work, and they do it every day. They inspect the fruit and vegetables that arrive at our ports of entry, much like the Port of Wilmington in my State. It is the top banana port in the country. They patrol our borders, like the Border Patrol agents dealing with increased migration from Central America. They defend our computer networks in cyber space, responding to a new and growing 21st-century threat. They keep our Presidents and Vice Presidents and their families and former Presidents and their families, as well as candidates for those positions, along with visiting foreign dignitaries, safe from harm. They have a lot of work to do. The work of these DHS personnel deployed at the frontlines is made possible in part because of the dedicated work of the men and women behind the scenes at the Department of Homeland Security's Management Directorate. As my colleagues have often heard me say, management really does matter. I will say it again: Management really does matter. And there are few places where that is more true than at the Department of Homeland Security. The Management Directorate works to support the missions and employees of all 22 component agencies which together comprise the Department of Homeland Security. They rent field offices, they buy essential equipment and vehicles, and they help to ensure that Department employees receive the paychecks and benefits they have worked for and earned. Within the Management Directorate, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer works to ensure that the Department is doing what is best for its employees, while providing the Department managers with the guidance and resources they need to help DHS take care of their own. One member of the Management Directorate is an especially committed fellow whose name is Phil Nowak. He is committed to DHS employees--his fellow colleagues. He is the Chief of Staff in the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. Phil grew up not in Iowa or Delaware, he grew up in San Francisco, not far from where I served in the Navy for a while. He joined the U.S. Coast Guard right after college. After serving in the Coast Guard for 20 years, he retired as a commander. I was once a commander--my favorite rank. Both of us served and exchange salutes all the time, Madam President. But Phil retired as a commander in 2007 and joined the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help coordinate disaster response. In 2010 Phil moved to the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, and in 2013 he took over as Chief of Staff. As Chief of Staff, Phil supports the work of the Chief Human Capital Officer in managing the workforce of the third largest Cabinet agency in our Federal Government--the third largest. With 22 component agencies and DHS employees stationed literally around the world, Phil and his team of 200 men and women certainly have their work cut out for them. Supporting the Department employees and providing them with the resources they need to excel and grow in their work is critical to maintaining a motivated, effective, and capable Department. With some notable exceptions, we know many of the components of this relatively young Department have struggled with employee morale almost from its inception.

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1073,CREC-2016-02-29,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1073-S1074] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. CARPER. Madam President, this is a day-night double header. That was the day game, and what I want to do now is focus on the second half of the story as long as time will allow me to do that. As the Presiding Officer knows, I come from the State of Delaware. Delaware is noted for a number of things, and one of the things we are noted for is that before any other State ratified the Constitution, we did it. For 1 whole week, Delaware was the entire United States of America. We opened it up and we let in Maryland and New Jersey and Pennsylvania, ultimately Iowa and other States, and I think it has turned out pretty well most days. But we were the first to ratify the Constitution. My family and I live in northern Delaware, and just up the road from us is Philadelphia. That is where the Constitution was first debated, and folks from throughout the 13 Colonies came and argued for and against different provisions and how we should set up the structure of our government. One of the hardest provisions they argued on and debated was whether there should be a legislative branch at all, and if there should be, should it just be unicameral--just one entity, one body within that legislative branch--or should there be two. Should the number of votes and the power that States have be in accordance with the size of their State, how many people they have, or how would they balance things out. Some of them worked out the Connecticut Compromise that said that every State will have two Senators--the same number--and they will be part of the U.S. Senate, and the House of Representatives would be comprised such that the more people who live in a State, the more Representatives they would have. That was the Connecticut Compromise. It was worked out. It was maybe not a perfect compromise in the eyes of some, but it enabled them to move forward, and most people think it is fair and reasonable. Another really tough issue they wrestled with in those days was with respect to the third branch of government. We have the executive and the legislative and the judicial branch. The question was, What are the judges going to do, these Federal judges? How are they going to be appointed? Who is going to pick them? And if it is the Chief Executive Officer, should the President be able to name by himself or herself who the judges are going to be, the Federal judges and the Supreme Court Justices? Should it be left up to the Senate? Should it be left up to the House of Representatives? Should it be a joint effort by the House and the Senate? Should there be some role for the President, the Chief Executive, to play? How should it work out? Time and again they voted on this issue at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Finally, after a number of votes that were just not successful--they couldn't come to a successful conclusion-- they actually called out for clergy to come in and called on Divine intervention to get over this issue on how to pick, how to select Federal judges. I don't know if it was Divine intervention, but at the end of the day the deal said: The President shall nominate--not appoint, not name, but shall nominate--folks to serve as Federal judges, including the Supreme Court, and the Senate would have an opportunity to provide advice and consent to the President. We have argued a lot over the years about what advice and consent should be, but it makes very clear that the President has a job to do with respect to the naming of judges. I believe we have a job to do as well. About 300 yards from the tavern where the Constitution was first ratified on December 1787 in Delaware, with one hand on the Bible I raised my other hand and took an oath to defend the Constitution as Governor of Delaware. I had never thought very much about what kind of qualities I would look for in a judge. With my Republican opponent in the Governor's race, a wonderful guy named B. Gary Scott, in 1992, we had 35 joint appearances together, debates. In all those forums, no one ever asked: What quality would you look for in the people you would nominate to be a supreme court justice for the State of Delaware or a member of the court of chancery, which is a court that has a national and international role to play? The superior court also hears not just Delaware cases but national cases as well. In all those forums, nobody ever asked me: What would you consider? As it turned out, that was a very important part of my job. I am proud to say the Delaware judiciary is one of the highest regarded of any State judiciaries that we have. We have a very unusual system where there has to be an equal balance between Democrats and Republicans on the judiciary. It is not a spoils system. If there is one more Republican than a Democrat and there is a vacancy, you have to name a Democrat. That is the way the system works. When I was Governor, we had a person who had been chancellor of the court of chancery, which is a high honor. He decided he was going to leave. So we had a vacancy to fill. I named a Republican. In that case, I actually had the flexibility to name a Democrat or Republican. I wanted to name the best person that I thought was interested in serving. The criteria I used in nominating people to serve on the judiciary in Delaware was that I wanted people who were really smart. I wanted to nominate folks who knew the law. I sought to nominate people who embraced the Golden Rule, who treat other people the way they want to be treated, so that folks who came before them in a courtroom received [[Page S1074]] fair and equal treatment. I wanted to nominate people who worked hard. I wanted to nominate people who had good judgment. I sought to nominate people who were able to make a decision. Sometimes people can have a lot of those qualities but have a hard time making a decision. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to have people who could do all those things. My hope is that this President will look at Democrats, Republicans, and Independents and find among them the man or woman who meets all that criteria and more. That is the President's job. I was up at the Detroit Auto Show. I know the Presiding Officer has a lot of assembly and supply operations in his State. Delaware used to, until fairly recently, build more cars and trucks per capita than any other State. So I care a lot about who is running GM and Chrysler. We lost both plants a few years ago when they went into bankruptcy. But I still go back to the Detroit Auto Show most years to keep in touch with the industry. This last January, a month ago, I was in Detroit. It was the opening day of the Detroit Auto Show, with tens of thousands of people converging on the Detroit Auto Show, going this way and that way to see the different reviews and different vehicles, concept cars or new production vehicles that are going to be launched maybe later this year. During the afternoon, I was looking for a restroom. I found one and so did hundreds of other people--in and out of this one restroom. I noticed an older gentleman who was a custodian standing with his cart, his mop and bucket, and his broom, outside of the mass of humanity. I walked in. In spite of all of those people, the place was remarkably clean. I figured he was the janitor who had responsibility for this restroom. When I came out, I said to him: I just want to say, sir, that this is a really clean restroom. With all the different kinds of people you have coming in and out of here, I don't know how you do it. I just want to say thank you for doing your job really well. He looked me in the eye and said: That is my job. He said: This is my job. And he said: I try to do my job well. He said: Everybody has a job, and everybody should try to do their job well. I thought to myself: Wow, wow, what insight, what a message. Under the Constitution, the President has a job. Apparently he is moving--not with haste, but I think with dispatch--to try to meet his responsibilities. I know we have had any number of times when Presidents have nominated Supreme Court Justices in a Presidential election year. I know a dozen or more times it has happened. I think every single time we had hearings for that nominee. There has been the opportunity to debate the nominee, question the nominee, meet with the nominee, debate here on the floor, and vote on the nomination up or down. I don't know of any time when we have not done that, even when a nominee came to us during a Presidential election year. I know we are in a crazy election season. It is still 8 months, 9 months before the election. But I hope that, at the end of the day, just like that janitor at the Detroit Auto Show intent on doing his job, the rest of us have the feeling that we have a job to do and that we should be in town doing our job. We have that need. We have that responsibility. I hope we will fulfill it. (Mr. COATS assumed the Chair.) Mr. President, the other thing I want to say is ``baseball.'' When the Presiding Officer and I were House Members together, we used to play baseball. We played in the congressional baseball game maybe 10 years ago--me on the Democratic side, him on the Republican side. For a year or two, I was almost selected as the most valuable Republican player--and I am a Democrat. So I wasn't always a great player, but I gave it my best. I was in Florida for an event over the weekend, and last week in Florida and Arizona something wonderful happened. What happened was that spring training camps opened. Pitchers and catchers reported, and then the full teams started to report. When they start the spring training games in a day or two--maybe tomorrow--teams will take the field and they will take the field with nine players. When Justice Roberts was going through his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee, he was asked: What is the job of the Supreme Court? How would you describe it, in a simple way? He said: Our job basically is to call balls and strikes. When baseball teams take the field, they have nine players in nine positions. When the Supreme Court is in session, they have nine justices--or at least they did until the death of Justice Scalia. Just like you can't have a baseball team take the field without the shortstop or without the catcher or even without the second baseman or the center fielder and play well and do their job, at the end of the day, the Supreme Court is a team. They need nine--not players but nine justices--to be able to do their job well. Let's keep that in mind. The last thing I would say is that the American people are frustrated with us and our inability to get things done. Sometimes I can understand why they would feel that way. We have a great opportunity to get something done. I hope the President will nominate a terrific candidate, and I hope our Republican friends will at least have the courtesy of meeting with that man or woman, give him or her a chance to present themselves and explain what they are about, have a hearing on that person, and then give them the honor of a vote. I think they deserve that. Mr. President, I yield the floor for my friend from Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Leahy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1073-S1074] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. CARPER. Madam President, this is a day-night double header. That was the day game, and what I want to do now is focus on the second half of the story as long as time will allow me to do that. As the Presiding Officer knows, I come from the State of Delaware. Delaware is noted for a number of things, and one of the things we are noted for is that before any other State ratified the Constitution, we did it. For 1 whole week, Delaware was the entire United States of America. We opened it up and we let in Maryland and New Jersey and Pennsylvania, ultimately Iowa and other States, and I think it has turned out pretty well most days. But we were the first to ratify the Constitution. My family and I live in northern Delaware, and just up the road from us is Philadelphia. That is where the Constitution was first debated, and folks from throughout the 13 Colonies came and argued for and against different provisions and how we should set up the structure of our government. One of the hardest provisions they argued on and debated was whether there should be a legislative branch at all, and if there should be, should it just be unicameral--just one entity, one body within that legislative branch--or should there be two. Should the number of votes and the power that States have be in accordance with the size of their State, how many people they have, or how would they balance things out. Some of them worked out the Connecticut Compromise that said that every State will have two Senators--the same number--and they will be part of the U.S. Senate, and the House of Representatives would be comprised such that the more people who live in a State, the more Representatives they would have. That was the Connecticut Compromise. It was worked out. It was maybe not a perfect compromise in the eyes of some, but it enabled them to move forward, and most people think it is fair and reasonable. Another really tough issue they wrestled with in those days was with respect to the third branch of government. We have the executive and the legislative and the judicial branch. The question was, What are the judges going to do, these Federal judges? How are they going to be appointed? Who is going to pick them? And if it is the Chief Executive Officer, should the President be able to name by himself or herself who the judges are going to be, the Federal judges and the Supreme Court Justices? Should it be left up to the Senate? Should it be left up to the House of Representatives? Should it be a joint effort by the House and the Senate? Should there be some role for the President, the Chief Executive, to play? How should it work out? Time and again they voted on this issue at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Finally, after a number of votes that were just not successful--they couldn't come to a successful conclusion-- they actually called out for clergy to come in and called on Divine intervention to get over this issue on how to pick, how to select Federal judges. I don't know if it was Divine intervention, but at the end of the day the deal said: The President shall nominate--not appoint, not name, but shall nominate--folks to serve as Federal judges, including the Supreme Court, and the Senate would have an opportunity to provide advice and consent to the President. We have argued a lot over the years about what advice and consent should be, but it makes very clear that the President has a job to do with respect to the naming of judges. I believe we have a job to do as well. About 300 yards from the tavern where the Constitution was first ratified on December 1787 in Delaware, with one hand on the Bible I raised my other hand and took an oath to defend the Constitution as Governor of Delaware. I had never thought very much about what kind of qualities I would look for in a judge. With my Republican opponent in the Governor's race, a wonderful guy named B. Gary Scott, in 1992, we had 35 joint appearances together, debates. In all those forums, no one ever asked: What quality would you look for in the people you would nominate to be a supreme court justice for the State of Delaware or a member of the court of chancery, which is a court that has a national and international role to play? The superior court also hears not just Delaware cases but national cases as well. In all those forums, nobody ever asked me: What would you consider? As it turned out, that was a very important part of my job. I am proud to say the Delaware judiciary is one of the highest regarded of any State judiciaries that we have. We have a very unusual system where there has to be an equal balance between Democrats and Republicans on the judiciary. It is not a spoils system. If there is one more Republican than a Democrat and there is a vacancy, you have to name a Democrat. That is the way the system works. When I was Governor, we had a person who had been chancellor of the court of chancery, which is a high honor. He decided he was going to leave. So we had a vacancy to fill. I named a Republican. In that case, I actually had the flexibility to name a Democrat or Republican. I wanted to name the best person that I thought was interested in serving. The criteria I used in nominating people to serve on the judiciary in Delaware was that I wanted people who were really smart. I wanted to nominate folks who knew the law. I sought to nominate people who embraced the Golden Rule, who treat other people the way they want to be treated, so that folks who came before them in a courtroom received [[Page S1074]] fair and equal treatment. I wanted to nominate people who worked hard. I wanted to nominate people who had good judgment. I sought to nominate people who were able to make a decision. Sometimes people can have a lot of those qualities but have a hard time making a decision. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to have people who could do all those things. My hope is that this President will look at Democrats, Republicans, and Independents and find among them the man or woman who meets all that criteria and more. That is the President's job. I was up at the Detroit Auto Show. I know the Presiding Officer has a lot of assembly and supply operations in his State. Delaware used to, until fairly recently, build more cars and trucks per capita than any other State. So I care a lot about who is running GM and Chrysler. We lost both plants a few years ago when they went into bankruptcy. But I still go back to the Detroit Auto Show most years to keep in touch with the industry. This last January, a month ago, I was in Detroit. It was the opening day of the Detroit Auto Show, with tens of thousands of people converging on the Detroit Auto Show, going this way and that way to see the different reviews and different vehicles, concept cars or new production vehicles that are going to be launched maybe later this year. During the afternoon, I was looking for a restroom. I found one and so did hundreds of other people--in and out of this one restroom. I noticed an older gentleman who was a custodian standing with his cart, his mop and bucket, and his broom, outside of the mass of humanity. I walked in. In spite of all of those people, the place was remarkably clean. I figured he was the janitor who had responsibility for this restroom. When I came out, I said to him: I just want to say, sir, that this is a really clean restroom. With all the different kinds of people you have coming in and out of here, I don't know how you do it. I just want to say thank you for doing your job really well. He looked me in the eye and said: That is my job. He said: This is my job. And he said: I try to do my job well.

the superior court also hears not just delaware cases but national cases as well. in all those forums, nobody ever asked me: what would you consider? as it turned out, that was a very important part of my job. i am proud to say the delaware judiciary is one of the highest regarded of any state judiciaries that we have. we have a very unusual system where there has to be an equal balance between democrats and republicans on the judiciary. it is not a spoils system. if there is one more republican than a democrat and there is a vacancy, you have to name a democrat. that is the way the system works. when i was governor, we had a person who had been chancellor of the court of chancery, which is a high honor. he decided he was going to leave. so we had a vacancy to fill. i named a republican. in that case, i actually had the flexibility to name a democrat or republican. i wanted to name the best person that i thought was interested in serving. the criteria i used in nominating people to serve on the judiciary in delaware was that i wanted people who were really smart. i wanted to nominate folks who knew the law. i sought to nominate people who embraced the golden rule, who treat other people the way they want to be treated, so that folks who came before them in a courtroom received [[page s1074]] fair and equal treatment. i wanted to nominate people who worked hard. i wanted to nominate people who had good judgment. i sought to nominate people who were able to make a decision. sometimes people can have a lot of those qualities but have a hard time making a decision. i didn't want to do that. i wanted to have people who could do all those things. my hope is that this president will look at democrats, republicans, and independents and find among them the man or woman who meets all that criteria and more. that is the president's job. i was up at the detroit auto show. i know the presiding officer has a lot of assembly and supply operations in his state. delaware used to, until fairly recently, build more cars and trucks per capita than any other state. so i care a lot about who is running gm and chrysler. we lost both plants a few years ago when they went into bankruptcy. but i still go back to the detroit auto show most years to keep in touch with the industry. this last january, a month ago, i was in detroit. it was the opening day of the detroit auto show, with tens of thousands of people converging on the detroit auto show, going this way and that way to see the different reviews and different vehicles, concept cars or new production vehicles that are going to be launched maybe later this year. during the afternoon, i was looking for a restroom. i found one and so did hundreds of other people--in and out of this one restroom. i noticed an older gentleman who was a custodian standing with his cart, his mop and bucket, and his broom, outside of the mass of humanity. i walked in. in spite of all of those people, the place was remarkably clean. i figured he was the janitor who had responsibility for this restroom. when i came out, i said to him: i just want to say, sir, that this is a really clean restroom. with all the different kinds of people you have coming in and out of here, i don't know how you do it. i just want to say thank you for doing your job really well. he looked me in the eye and said: that is my job. he said: this is my job. and he said: i try to do my job well. he said: everybody has a job, and everybody should try to do their job well. i thought to myself: wow, wow, what insight, what a message. under the constitution, the president has a job. apparently he is moving--not with haste, but i think with dispatch--to try to meet his responsibilities. i know we have had any number of times when presidents have nominated supreme court justices in a presidential election year. i know a dozen or more times it has happened. i think every single time we had hearings for that nominee. there has been the opportunity to debate the nominee, question the nominee, meet with the nominee, debate here on the floor, and vote on the nomination up or down. i don't know of any time when we have not done that, even when a nominee came to us during a presidential election year. i know we are in a crazy election season. it is still 8 months, 9 months before the election. but i hope that, at the end of the day, just like that janitor at the detroit auto show intent on doing his job, the rest of us have the feeling that we have a job to do and that we should be in town doing our job. we have that need. we have that responsibility. i hope we will fulfill it. (mr. coats assumed the chair.) mr. president, the other thing i want to say is ``baseball.'' when the presiding officer and i were house members together, we used to play baseball. we played in the congressional baseball game maybe 10 years ago--me on the democratic side, him on the republican side. for a year or two, i was almost selected as the most valuable republican player--and i am a democrat. so i wasn't always a great player, but i gave it my best. i was in florida for an event over the weekend, and last week in florida and arizona something wonderful happened. what happened was that spring training camps opened. pitchers and catchers reported, and then the full teams started to report. when they start the spring training games in a day or two--maybe tomorrow--teams will take the field and they will take the field with nine players. when justice roberts was going through his confirmation hearing before the judiciary committee, he was asked: what is the job of the supreme court? how would you describe it, in a simple way? he said: our job basically is to call balls and strikes. when baseball teams take the field, they have nine players in nine positions. when the supreme court is in session, they have nine justices--or at least they did until the death of justice scalia. just like you can't have a baseball team take the field without the shortstop or without the catcher or even without the second baseman or the center fielder and play well and do their job, at the end of the day, the supreme court is a team. they need nine--not players but nine justices--to be able to do their job well. let's keep that in mind. the last thing i would say is that the american people are frustrated with us and our inability to get things done. sometimes i can understand why they would feel that way. we have a great opportunity to get something done. i hope the president will nominate a terrific candidate, and i hope our republican friends will at least have the courtesy of meeting with that man or woman, give him or her a chance to present themselves and explain what they are about, have a hearing on that person, and then give them the honor of a vote. i think they deserve that. mr. president, i yield the floor for my friend from vermont, the senior democrat on the senate judiciary committee, mr. leahy. ____________________",11459
CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1074-2,CREC-2016-02-29,114,COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1074-S1080] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 524, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 369, S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their designees. The Senator from Vermont. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the senior Senator from Delaware. We have plenty of time to get a nomination to the Supreme Court from the President and to confirm a Justice, just as this body has done 12 times in Presidential election years. I think probably the most recent, of course, was when Democrats controlled the Senate and we confirmed unanimously President Reagan's nomination in an election year, his final year in office. So it can easily be done. Besides, let us just do our job. We get paid to be here and to do our job. We ought to do it. We also have the matter that each one of us has taken a very solemn oath before God to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution says the President shall nominate and the Senate shall advise and consent. We ought to do just what we all have solemnly sworn to do. I take my oath very seriously. I hope other Senators do too. Now, Mr. President, today the full Senate is going to begin a discussion about one of the most challenging public health crises of our time--addiction to prescription painkillers and other opioids. In my home State of Vermont, there are few issues more pressing than opioid addiction. It is tearing apart families and communities-- families and communities I have known all my life. In March 2008, nearly 8 years ago, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I first held a hearing in Rutland, VT, about the challenges this epidemic presents in rural parts of our country. In subsequent field hearings, we learned about how communities like Rutland, VT--a beautiful community--were constructively seeking ways to get ahead of addiction. But we also learned--and I think we knew [[Page S1075]] this--that there are no easy answers, and we need a comprehensive approach. Education, prevention, and treatment are essential if we are to reverse the tide in this fight. Vermont's all-hands-on-deck example serves as a model for other States and communities across the Nation. In fact, just last week an article in the Christian Science Monitor detailed how Vermont's pioneering approach has been embraced well beyond Vermont's borders. So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Christian Science Monitor article entitled ``How one state turned its `heroin crisis' into a national lesson'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. Opioid addiction is not a new issue. It is not new to me, and it is not new to Vermont. But it is about time that the full Congress gave this public health crisis the attention it deserves. The bill we begin to consider today, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, represents a positive step forward, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of it. For decades, the knee-jerk response in Congress to those who struggled with addiction was misguided. We embraced harsh and arbitrary mandatory minimums, we ignored effective treatment options, and we pushed addicts further underground and away from recovery. Such policies reflect a complete misunderstanding of the problem of addiction. At my hearings and everywhere I went, we saw police officers, faith communities, educators, medical professionals, parents, and addicts coming together, saying that no one group had the answer but the community had to come together. Because we know addiction is a disease, we know our tools for combating addiction must be the same as other disease--a commitment to evidence-based education and proven techniques for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. As one who has served in law enforcement, I know that law enforcement is an important element in a comprehensive approach. That is why I worked to include in this bill an authorization for funding to expand State-led anti-heroin task forces. But this legislation is important because it treats addiction as the public health crisis that it is. The bill authorizes a crucial program that I helped create that expands access to medication-assisted treatment programs--programs that have been plagued by massive waiting lists. The clinic in Chittenden County, VT--that is the largest of our 14 counties--has seen its wait list lengthened to nearly a year. What happens when that wait list is long? Several people have overdosed and died while waiting for treatment. Those deaths were probably preventable. We shouldn't die waiting for treatment. We have to do better. The bill also recognizes the devastating impact that opioid abuse has on rural communities. Just as in your State and every other State, we have rural communities. Vermont is predominantly rural communities. My home where my wife and I have lived since we got married is on a dirt road. We know rural America. We know it has been hit hard by addiction. Emergency medical services in rural communities are often limited. I am glad that the bill we reported out of committee includes my provision to support our rural communities for the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Over the last decade, death rates from opioid overdoses have steadily climbed across the country. But there is a real disparity between rural communities and major cities. We found the more rural a location, the higher the death rate. Getting lifesaving drugs into more hands will save lives across the country, especially in our rural communities that are among the hardest hit. This is not a partisan issue. I thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator Grassley for working with me on this legislation in our Judiciary Committee. I hope we will soon see its passage here in the Senate. But one authorization bill by itself is not going to end addiction. It is not going to end the deaths that we are seeing in rural America and in urban America. We need a significant commitment of targeted funding to implement this bill. Senator Shaheen's $600 million emergency supplemental appropriations bill provides those resources, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation, as well. In your State, my State, and the other 48 States right now, we passed larger emergency supplemental bills that addressed swine flu and Ebola. We do not have Ebola in our country, but we passed an emergency supplemental bill to address that. We need to address what we have right here within our country today. Swine flu and Ebola presented far, far fewer dramatic health risks to our communities. We need to take this challenge just as seriously. The bill we are considering today has received strong bipartisan support and deservedly so. But I hope all the Senators supporting CARA today will also support Senator Shaheen's legislation. One goes hand in hand with the other. We need to authorize these advances in dealing with the opioid crisis, but then we actually need to fund them. We cannot pretend that solving a problem as large as opioid addiction costs nothing. We have an opportunity to equip our communities with the support and resources they need to finally get ahead of addiction. Programs will save lives. That is a worthy investment. It is very easy to say we will pass a law to stop opioid addiction. We can all feel good about voting for that. Who is going to vote for legislation to say ``let us continue opioid addiction''? But if we do not put the money in it, then, basically, we are saying we want to feel good but we are not going to do anything for you. We spend money worldwide. Some of it is for good causes, and some of it is totally wasted. Here we have a problem in the United States of America, where our priorities are first and foremost to our country. If you saw some of the people I heard in these hearings all over our beautiful State, some of the families with whom I have talked across their kitchen tables, and a young woman who had been addicted and is now helping to counsel others and the story she told, or if you saw a movie or TV program, you would say it couldn't be that grim. Well, it was. It is. These people go across all income brackets, all brackets of education. It is tearing apart parts of our communities across the country. Fortunately, we have had some very brave people stand up. I hope Senator Shaheen's appropriation goes through because, if it does not, we are saying all the right things, as we should, except for one thing: We are not going to pay for it. This is too important to say the check is in the mail; just wait and wait. We can do better. We can do better. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From The Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 23, 2016] How One State Turned Its `Heroin Crisis' Into a National Lesson (By Gail Russell Chaddock) Paths to Progress: Vermont's pioneering focus on treatment amid an opioid crisis is being embraced by politicians of both parties--well beyond the state. America's opioid addiction crisis, now claiming 78 lives a day, is sweeping aside party lines both at the state level and even in famously gridlocked Washington. The nation's governors, from deep-red Alabama to bluest-of- the-blue Vermont, are moving rapidly to a strategy of treating illegal drug users rather than jailing them. It's a shift that runs deep in public opinion, as well. Some two-thirds of Americans now typically say that they prefer providing treatment to long prison sentences. ``This is an area where I can get agreement from Bernie Sanders and Mitch McConnell,'' President Obama said at a White House meeting with governors on Monday. ``That doesn't happen that often, but this is one. And it indicates the severity of the issue.'' But the governors are, in fact, well ahead of Washington on this issue--as they were on welfare reform in the 1990s and, more recently, sentencing reform. Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) of Vermont, a leader in the pivot from prisons to treatment, says he got into the addiction fight after talking to people in his state. ``I found we were doing almost everything wrong,'' he told a forum on opioid and heroin addiction at The Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington on Friday. The best hope is to get more people into treatment, he said. And the best time to do that is ``when the blue lights are flashing and the handcuffs are on.'' Vermont, like other states in the Northeast, is facing severe opioid challenges. In 2014, Governor Shumlin devoted his annual State of the State address entirely to [[Page S1076]] Vermont's ``full-blown heroin crisis.'' Annual overdose deaths from opioids had nearly doubled since 2004. The number of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction had spiked 770 percent since 2000. what vermont has done And so Vermont has taken a hard look at its approach. Instead of jail, nonviolent offenders are given the option of going into treatment. They start in one of the state's new central clinics (hubs) and move on to a family doctor, counselor, or therapist closer to home (spokes). Vermont law also shields people seeking medical help for an overdose from prosecution for manufacturing or selling drugs, not just for minor crimes. It also was the first state to legalize the sale of naloxone over the counter in pharmacies--a drug aimed at reversing overdoses and saving lives. Other states have moved toward treatment instead of incarceration, but Vermont has done it on a grander scale, experts say. ``You've seen some elected officials support legalizing marijuana, some want to reform sentencing, some talk about overdoses, but very few have tied all these together in a comprehensive narrative,'' says Bill Piper, senior director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance in Washington. ``Vermont's governor is at the forefront, and what makes him unique is that he's one of the few elected officials that has connected the dots on the various issues,'' he adds. As a pioneer state, Vermont has also identified some of the limits of a treatment-centric strategy. ``As you build out treatment, and particularly in rural America, we can't get enough docs who are able to meet the demand of our waiting lists,'' Shumlin told the president at the White House meeting Monday. But the most important issue, he told Mr. Obama, is to ``come up with a more rational approach to prescribing prescription drugs.'' a bid to rein in prescriptions Governors see legal prescriptions for drugs like OxyContin as the gateway to heroin. ``Overprescribing of opioid painkillers has fueled the nation's addiction crisis,'' according to a report from the National Governors Association's Health and Human Services Committee. In a bid to rein in prescriptions, governors on that committee plan to develop a list of protocols to present to the full membership at the next NGA meeting in August. ``The United States represents 5 percent of the world's population and consumes 80 percent of the world's opioids,'' said Gov. Charlie Baker (R) of Massachusetts, who chairs the NGA's Health and Human Services Committee, on Saturday. That's ``fundamentally flawed.'' When prescriptions are too hard to get--or too expensive-- addicts switch to heroin. ``Most of the heroin addicts we treat started by using prescription opiates,'' says Brian McAlister, author of ``Full Recovery'' and CEO of the Full Recovery Wellness Center in Fairfield, N.J. ``Some were prescribed by a doctor or dentist, others were stolen from family or friends' medicine cabinets, and others were purchased illegally just to party--but the party ends very quickly. These drugs are highly addictive, and when the supply runs out, the problems get worse.'' at the national level The prospect of politicians reining in pharmaceutical sales is a stretch in the halls of Congress. In 1993, the GOP- controlled Congress explicitly barred government from negotiating lower drug prices with drug companies. Last year, Big Pharma spent more than $235 million to influence policy outcomes in Washington--the largest budget of any lobby group in Washington. Governors could set protocols on prescribing practices for painkillers on their own, Shumlin told the president. ``But it takes time,'' and ``it doesn't apply to all 50 states.'' Instead, he asked Obama to ``consider a national approach which simply says, for minor procedures, we're going to limit this to 10 pills and after that you've got to come back for more.'' ``To be candid, the docs, the AMA [American Medical Association] are resistant to listening to politicians like us talking about how many pills to prescribe. But is there something you could do on a national level that would help us get out of this tragic mess?'' he added. Obama answered, at length, but in the end deferred to the states. ``A very specific approach to working with the docs, the hospitals, the providers so that they are not overprescribing'' can be done at the national level, he said. ``But it is most profitably done, I think, if we have bipartisan support from the governors so that by the time it gets to the national level, there is consensus and there's not a lot of politics involved in it.'' In a recent blog, AMA president Steven Stack called the opioid epidemic a ``defining moment'' for the profession. ``Our nation is needlessly losing thousands of people to a preventable epidemic, and we must take action for our patients.'' Mr. LEAHY. I see nobody else seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask the time be equally divided. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 369, S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Mitch McConnell, Daniel Coats, Dan Sullivan, Orrin G. Hatch, Shelley Moore Capito, John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, Roy Blunt, Ron Johnson, Chuck Grassley, Rob Portman, Susan M. Collins, Jeff Flake, Cory Gardner, Lamar Alexander, John Barrasso, John McCain. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) would have voted ``yea'', the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan) would have voted ``yea'', and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 89, nays 0, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 27 Leg.] YEAS--89 Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Stabenow Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NOT VOTING--11 Alexander Blunt Boozman Cruz McCaskill Rubio Sanders Shelby Sullivan Toomey Vitter The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays are 0. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, an historic epidemic of drug overdose deaths is gripping our country. Over 47,000 Americans died from overdoses in 2014, an alltime high. Incredibly, that is more deaths than resulted from either car crashes or gun violence. Addiction to opioids, primarily prescription pain killers and heroin, is driving this epidemic. It is destroying lives, families, and communities. It is a crisis. And it demands action. [[Page S1077]] Thankfully, the Senate can act this week, when we consider S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. CARA is a bipartisan bill authored by two Democrats and two Republicans--Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Klobuchar, and Ayotte. These Senators have shown extraordinary leadership on this issue. They deserve credit for crafting a bill that addresses many of the different aspects of this epidemic, through evidence-based solutions and best practices. This is a complex crisis that requires a multifaceted solution. Over the past few months, I have worked hard with the bill's authors to refine it and move it through the Judiciary Committee. I am proud to say that a few weeks ago it passed the committee on a voice vote, with no opposition. CARA is only the latest bipartisan legislative accomplishment by the Judiciary Committee this Congress. We have had 21 bills pass the Committee this Congress, all with bipartisan support. But there are a few major bills that stand out. Last April, the committee passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act unanimously, 19-0. The bill enhances penalties for human trafficking and equips law enforcement with new tools to target predators who traffic innocent young people. The bill passed the Senate 99-0 and was signed into law by the President. In October, the committee passed the landmark Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act with a strong 15-5 bipartisan vote. My bill would recalibrate prison sentences for certain drug offenders, target violent criminals, and grant judges greater discretion at sentencing for lower- level drug crimes. I am working hard to build additional support for the bill so that it can be taken up by the full Senate soon. Then in December, the committee passed my Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act, again without opposition. The bill will ensure that at-risk youth are fairly and effectively served by juvenile justice grant programs. Again, we are working hard to move this bill through the full Senate. The bipartisan reforms enacted by each of these bills address real problems that affect the lives of many people across the nation and in my home state of Iowa. I am proud of the work we have done so far--but there is a lot more to do. And that brings me back to the heroin and prescription drug epidemic. It isn't as bad in Iowa as it is in many areas of the country, but the eastern part of my State has been hit hard recently. The human cost of what is happening across so many of these communities is incalculable. Every life that is lost or changed forever by this epidemic is precious. Especially for many young people who fall victim to addiction early in their lives, there is so much human potential at stake. Many Iowans have heard the story of Kim Brown, a nurse from Davenport, and her son Andy. Andy was prescribed pain pills when he had surgery at age 14. Whether it was connected to abuse of those pain pills or not, he developed a drug problem as a teenager that he couldn't shake. He overdosed on heroin a few times but survived. And finally, at age 33, he died of an overdose, tragically leaving behind two young sons. Ms. Brown now speaks out around the State about the heroin epidemic. Her story reflects a larger pattern. Over the last 20 years or so, doctors have increasingly prescribed opioids to help their patients manage pain. For many, these medicines have been the answer to their prayers. But for others, they have led to a nightmare of addiction. According to numerous studies, prescription opioid addiction is a strong risk factor for heroin addiction. In some cases, those addicted to painkillers turn to heroin to get a similar high, because recently, it has become cheaper and more easily available. And as Ms. Brown's story reflects, this epidemic is a matter of life and death. In fact, nationally, heroin overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014. But Iowans are fighting back. Last year, with the assistance of a new Federal grant, the U.S. Attorney's office and the Cedar Rapids Police Department formed the Eastern Iowa Heroin Initiative. This partnership is focused on stemming the tide of heroin abuse through enforcement, prevention and treatment. I have been invited to participate in a townhall with them to discuss the epidemic, and I plan to do so soon. When I do, I want to tell them that the Senate has acted on this crisis by passing CARA. CARA supports so many of the efforts to help stem the tide of addiction that are underway in Iowa and across the country. As its name reflects, the bill addresses the epidemic comprehensively, supporting prevention, education, treatment, recovery, and law enforcement. CARA starts with prevention and education. It authorizes awareness and education campaigns, so that the public understands the dangers of becoming addicted to prescription painkillers. It creates a national task force to develop best prescribing practices, so that doctors don't expose their patients to unnecessary risks of addiction. The bill encourages the use of prescription drug monitoring programs like Iowa's, which helps detect and deter ``doctor shopping'' behavior by addicts. And the bill authorizes an expansion of the Federal initiative that allows patients to safely dispose of old or unused medications, so that these drugs don't fall into the hands of young people, potentially leading to addiction. In fact, along with a few other committee members, I helped start this ``take back'' program in 2010 through the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act. It has been a highly successful effort. Since 2010, over 2,700 tons of drugs have been collected from medicine cabinets and disposed of safely. Iowa also has a similar ``take back'' program that's expanding rapidly. CARA also focuses on treatment and recovery. The bill authorizes programs to provide first responders with training to use Naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and directly save lives. Naloxone was used hundreds of times by first responders in Iowa in 2014. Importantly, the bill provides that a set portion of Naloxone funding go to rural areas, like much of Iowa that is being affected most acutely. This is critical when someone overdoses and isn't near a hospital. The bill also authorizes an expansion of Drug Free Communities Act grants to those areas that are most dramatically affected by the opioid epidemic. And it also authorizes funds for programs that encourage the use of medication assisted treatment, provide community-based support for those in recovery, and address the unique needs of pregnant and postpartum women who are addicted to opioids. Finally, the bill also bolsters law enforcement efforts as well. Amazingly, in 2007, only 8 percent of State and local law enforcement officials across the country identified heroin as the greatest drug threat in their area. But by 2015, that number rose to 38 percent, more than any other drug. So the bill reauthorizes Federal funding for State task forces that specifically address heroin trafficking. I am also pleased that I was able to include in the bill a reauthorization of the funding for the methamphetamine law enforcement task forces as well. I held a Judiciary Committee field hearing in Des Moines last fall about the ongoing meth problem across Iowa. And one thing the hearing made clear is that our friends in State law enforcement need all the help we can give them on that front, too. All in all, the bill authorizes about $78 million per year to address this crisis. It is no wonder that the bill is supported by a diverse range of stakeholders, including the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, the National District Attorneys Association, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, and so many organizations in the treatment and recovery communities. I urge my colleagues to support it this week, when the Senate has the opportunity to act to address this epidemic. We owe it to those, like Kim Brown, who have lost sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, coworkers and friends to act now. [[Page S1078]] I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley. Many years ago I went to Iowa with Senator Grassley to set up an anti-drug coalition. We had done one in Ohio. I was the chair of that, and Chuck Grassley asked if I would come. This was probably 20 years ago that Senator Grassley--and I was in the House. We had a great visit. We had a couple of townhall meetings. Chuck Grassley is a guy who understands the issue, cares about it, and has devoted a lot of time and resources to it in Iowa. The people of Iowa know he is sincere about it because he has been on the ground setting up these coalitions and dealing with this issue. Frankly, it is a little disappointing--probably to him and to me--to see that some 20 years later we are still facing this issue now and even different issues. He mentioned methamphetamines. He mentioned, of course, the heroin and opiate addiction problems with prescription drugs. Twenty years ago it was more marijuana and cocaine, but I think the lesson we have all learned is these drugs will come and go in terms of their severity and their impact on our communities and our families, but it is always going to be there, and we need to keep up the fight. Right now we have an urgent problem. That urgent problem was outlined by Senator Grassley, but it is this growing use of opiates that leads to a horrible addiction. It has a grip on so many of our constituents, so many of our loved ones. Over the weekend I had a townhall meeting. I asked--after we had talked about taxes, trade, energy, and other issues--if people would just raise their hands if they had been affected by the heroin and prescription drug addiction problem. I said: Has anybody in your family and friends been affected? Half of the hands in the room went up. Unfortunately, that is the reality of this situation. In Ohio last year we lost almost 2,400 just to overdose deaths. That doesn't account for the fact that so many people are being saved now by naloxone--which is something that is encouraged by our legislation and we will talk about it in a second. Narcan is being used, but even those who survive the overdoses, of course, are seeing their families broken apart, their communities devastated. I talked to a prosecutor over the weekend in one of our more rural counties, and he said: Rob, over 80 percent of our crime is directly related to this issue now, heroin and prescription drugs. Often it is people committing crimes to pay for their habit. The people who are the purveyors of these drugs have a business plan; that is, to get you hooked with a relatively low cost at first and then you need more and more to be able to feel the same high. It gets more expensive to the point that it might go from $50 to $100 the first time to $1,000 or $1,500 a day by the end of your addiction. This is how horrible it is and it leads to so many collateral consequences. I am very pleased the Senate voted tonight to proceed to this legislation called CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. CARA is a Federal response to this issue. It is attempting to make the Federal Government a better partner with State and local governments, with nonprofits, to be able to help to reverse this tide to deal with this urgent problem in our communities. I would call it an epidemic. It certainly is at epidemic levels in my State of Ohio. Sadly, we are the top five in the country in terms of overdose deaths, but again it goes well beyond just those deaths. There are so many people who are affected by it negatively and so many who have not been able to fulfill their God-given purpose because of this horrible addiction. This legislation called CARA is bipartisan. It is comprehensive. As Senator Grassley said, he got it through the Judiciary Committee. I appreciate that. He got it through with something very extraordinary around here, which is a unanimous vote--meaning nobody objected. That never happens around here. It just means that every Senator is addressing this issue back home, understands it, and wants to do something about it. This legislation is built on common sense, research, and experts from around the country who have come in. I thank Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who is the lead Democrat on this legislation and my lead cosponsor. He and I are the coauthors of this legislation. I also thank Senators Kelly Ayotte and Amy Klobuchar, who have been terrific partners. Then there are 34 other bipartisan cosponsors. I thank them all for their support. I am excited that if this bill can pass, it will pass in the House as well because there is companion legislation. In fact, the House bill has 88 cosponsors right now--also bipartisan. So the idea is to get this bill passed, get it through the House, and have it signed into law by the President of the United States. It is urgent we do it. This is a bill that not only has a lot of support on both sides of the aisle, but--much more importantly to me--it has the support of people all over the country who are experts in this field: doctors; those in recovery; experts in prevention, treatment, and recovery; and law enforcement. The legislation actually comes--I hope you can see on this chart, the words are kind of small--but it comes from the last few years, putting together these experts from all around the country. We had five different summit meetings in Washington, DC. One was with the criminal justice system. We brought in experts from all around the country to talk about treatment and alternatives to incarceration. As you will see in this legislation, we have ways to divert people from incarceration into treatment programs, which we think is part of the way to solve this problem. We then had one that focused on women, the special interests and needs of women who are facing addiction and how to ensure they get into treatment. As we will talk about later, this has a lot to do with one of the problems that is out there right now, which is more and more babies who are born with addiction and having to take those babies through withdrawal. The care and compassion involved in that is truly impressive, but that was a good forum for us. We had one on the science of addiction and addressing the consequences of addiction. There are a lot of good people around the country who understand the science of this and what medication might work and what future medication might be better to deal with it. We talked about youth drug prevention and developing communities of recovery. This is a very important aspect of our legislation. We don't just talk about treatment, as important as that is, we talked about how you divert people from getting into it in the first place through better prevention and education. Finally, we had a forum on veterans focusing on substance abuse and PTSD and other issues. I recently visited one of our veterans courts in Columbus, OH, and saw the good work they are doing. Most people going through that court have mental health issues. Most also now have, sadly, opioid addiction issues, usually starting with prescription drugs and moving to heroin. As I said, there is strong bipartisan support for this legislation in the House and the Senate. It is endorsed by more than 130 groups nationwide. By the way, those groups include some groups you might not expect normally to be together on something such as this--the Fraternal Order of Police, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the Faces and Voices of Recovery, the Coalition for a Drug Free America, the Children's Hospital Association, the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers, the Partnership for Drug Free Kids, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, groups who are in all of our States, the National Council for Behavioral Health, and, of course, the Major County Sheriffs' Association. So law enforcement, treatment, recovery, education--everybody is coming together on this because we realize this is going to take that kind of comprehensive approach with all sectors of our community being involved and engaged. CARA now has support not only of a lot of these groups from around the country, but because of these groups--they helped us write a better bill. [[Page S1079]] What does the bill do? Here are the basic elements of CARA: First, with regard to prevention and education, it does establish new task forces to develop better practices for prescribers simply because there has been overprescribing, particularly of prescription drugs. These narcotics have been overprescribed to the point that many people end up on heroin as a less expensive alternative to the prescription drugs to which they have become addicted. The task force is an interagency task force that is reporting back to the Congress on how to develop these best practices for the medical community. The bill also establishes a national awareness campaign with regard to prevention and education. That is critical for us to get the word out. It has grants to local coalitions. This is in the Drug-Free Communities Act area. The Drug-Free Communities Act goes back to the 1990s. Since 1998 there has been $1.3 billion spent under the Drug-Free Communities Act. I was the author of that in the House. It is good legislation that helped create over 2,000 community coalitions around America. I chaired ours in Cincinnati, OH, for 9 years and am still very involved with it, and they do great work. But, again, we now have this new issue, this new threat we must address. This helps with regard to specific grants where there is a high degree of opioid addiction and the negative consequences of it, to be able to blend with the drug-free community program. Law enforcement. The bill provides for training for Narcan--what is known as naloxone--for first responders to prevent overdoses. I think everybody in this Chamber has run into this back home. I went to a firehouse recently because we had lost a brave firefighter in a house fire, and I went to talk to his shift about him and to thank them for their service. After talking to them about their fallen comrade, they wanted to talk about this issue. They told me: Rob, we are spending more time administering Narcan than we are fighting fires these days. In other words, they are going out and helping people who are having overdoses and are saving their lives. A friend of mine who is a firefighter in Cincinnati told me just a couple of weeks ago that he was responding to an overdose, saving someone in front of a house, when, in an entirely different group in the back of the house, an overdose occurred. In Toledo last week, there was a response by emergency medical services to somebody who had hit a telephone pole. They found him with a syringe in his arm. He had overdosed. While they were responding to him, there were two other overdose calls in Toledo--one city in Ohio. There were three at the same time. Two of the three were saved by Narcan. The third died. Our folks in law enforcement and our first responders, our firefighters, are doing a terrific job. They need help. They need more Narcan and more training to be sure they can continue to do what they are doing to prevent these overdoses. It is not the answer. Of course, the answer is prevention, education, and better treatment. But in the meantime, we have to provide them the help they need. The law enforcement side also expands these drug prescription take- back programs. They work very well, as Senator Grassley said, in some of our States. We need to do more to expand those, and that is usually done through our law enforcement communities. It also authorizes a task force to combat heroin and methamphetamines. These are the law enforcement task forces we talked about earlier, which will help to coordinate Federal, State, and local law enforcement to deal with this issue. On the treatment and recovery side, it expands medication assisted treatment for opioid and heroin addiction. It creates diversion, education, and treatment programs in the criminal justice system. We talked about that earlier. That is so important. I have been at roundtable discussions all around my State and at a number of treatment centers talking to recovering addicts about how they got into the situation they are in and what advice they have. A young man told me a classic story. He had an injury. He started using prescription drugs. He got addicted. He needed money to buy these expensive pain pills. He actually stole from a family member, and he ended up in the law enforcement system and in jail. It was in jail that he was told for the first time that it was actually cheaper to buy heroin. He got out and bought heroin and became a heroin addict. He is now in treatment. He hit rock bottom, as he said, and I think it was because he had an overdose. This is something where we need to figure out a better way to get people diverted and use the criminal justice system to provide the incentive to get them into the right treatment program. It also supports recovery for youth and building communities of recovery, again focusing on our youth to get them to make the right decisions but also steering our youth who are addicted into the recovery they need. Sadly, this is now necessary in many of our high schools and in our colleges and universities. It also establishes a task force to review some of the recovery and collateral consequences. This is an interagency task force that is going to report back to us on what is truly working and what is not working in order to do a deeper dive to ensure we are using this money most effectively in order to make a difference. It has treatment services for women and veterans included. This is a special interest of ours in this legislation--expanding treatment for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction, again to avoid this horrible situation where babies are born with an addiction. It also supports care for our veterans. Our veterans right now can enter treatment, of course, following discharge with this legislation. This is important. Our veterans have some special needs and special circumstances--often trauma, PTSD, and other things related to their addiction. We find these veterans courts are incredibly helpful, to be able to have them surrounded by fellow veterans in order to make more progress. That is in here as well. Finally, the legislation incentivizes the States themselves to enact comprehensive initiatives to address the opioid and heroin abuse problem--the prescription drug monitoring program, for instance. This is very important. The Federal Government has a big role to play here. Think about it. If you are in one State and you are monitoring someone's prescription drug medications, knowing where they are going and how much they are getting to avoid overprescribing, if that person crosses State lines, it is very difficult. So our legislation expands on what can be done there to ensure that, for instance, my State of Ohio knows whether someone has gone to Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, or Michigan to get prescription drugs. So the prescription drug monitoring program will work better for every State. Prevention and education on heroin abuses--this is to incentivize States to do a better job on the prevention and education side and, of course, to prevent overdose and to improve drug treatment. These are all aspects of this legislation. It is comprehensive because the problem is complex and requires a comprehensive approach. Here are some statistics--we have already talked about some this evening--that are shocking. We know that 28,647 Americans died in the last year for which we had data, which is 2014, from a drug overdose. The 2015 numbers will be higher than that. That is roughly 120 Americans dying every day. There were 27,000 diagnosed cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 2013, the last numbers we have. It is even worse this year. This means babies were born with an addiction. A baby is born dependent on opioids every 19 minutes in America. So while I am speaking today, there will be another baby born who is addicted. I have gone to hospitals in Cincinnati; in Lima, OH, to St. Rita's; to Rainbow Babies Children's Hospital in Cleveland, OH. They are incredible caregivers. My wife Jane was at Nationwide Children's Hospital today, actually, on this very issue. These are babies who are so tiny, you can almost hold them in the palm of your hand. They need caregivers to take them through a process where they go through withdrawal. And we are not [[Page S1080]] sure what the long-term consequences are because we don't have the data yet because this is such a new issue. There has been a substantial increase over the last several years. In Ohio, the same thing I said earlier--750 percent increase in the number of babies diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome since 2004. There has been a 750-percent increase in babies born addicted. These are the issues this legislation gets at. Again, it does so in a way that is not just bipartisan, which is important, and not just House and Senate, which is important--the House has its own companion bill, one the President will be able to sign into law--but most importantly, it is because of the input of people from all over this country, the experts, people who are recovering themselves, and those who are most affected by this, that this legislation makes sense, and not just for my State but for our country. The Judiciary Committee had a number of good witnesses. One was a woman named Tonda DaRe. Tonda DaRe is from Ohio. She had a daughter named Holly. On her 21st birthday, Holly, who had a bright future ahead of her--she was engaged to be married, and she had been very involved in her high school and active in sports--tried heroin for the first time. She became addicted. She went into recovery, and unfortunately, as in many cases, she had a relapse. At age 23 her young life ended in an overdose. Her mom, Tonda DaRe, set up an organization called Holly's Song of Hope. She testified before the Judiciary Committee about the importance of her work--talking to other mothers and fathers and sons and daughters about the devastating consequences of this heroin and prescription drug addiction. This legislation needs to be passed so that we can help Tonda. She testified on behalf of this legislation because she has looked at it and knows it will make a difference in her life and her community. This is an urgent problem, as I said earlier. It is also one we have a lot of bipartisan consensus around. There will be opportunities during this debate to hear from a lot of different people on a lot of different ideas on amendments to the legislation. That is good. It is good to have a debate. But I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will keep focused on the importance of getting this done. It is important to get it done in terms of providing immediate help to our communities and also providing a structure to more effectively spend funds this year--and yes, we have funds to spend this year that have been appropriated consistent with CARA--but also next year and the year after and the year after. Some will support more resources, and that is fine. We need to have that debate. I myself think it is a priority, and we should be providing the resources to be able to deal with this issue. I would also urge my colleagues to ensure that we get this over the finish line. It is too important. We can't play politics with it. This is one of those issues, again, like so few around here, that got out of the committee without a single dissenting vote. We have done the right thing on a bipartisan basis to bring in the experts. We have a good solution to an urgent problem we all face. I am pleased with the vote tonight, and I urge my colleagues to have a good debate on the floor. Let's get this done for the sake of Tonda DaRe and so many other mothers, fathers, and others out there who deserve to have a little help in their fight against opioid addiction. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to congratulate the Senator from Ohio for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. This is an epidemic that affects us all, and he has definitely been at the fore in providing exceptional leadership on this, and I want to commend him for that. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1074-S1080] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 524, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 369, S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their designees. The Senator from Vermont. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the senior Senator from Delaware. We have plenty of time to get a nomination to the Supreme Court from the President and to confirm a Justice, just as this body has done 12 times in Presidential election years. I think probably the most recent, of course, was when Democrats controlled the Senate and we confirmed unanimously President Reagan's nomination in an election year, his final year in office. So it can easily be done. Besides, let us just do our job. We get paid to be here and to do our job. We ought to do it. We also have the matter that each one of us has taken a very solemn oath before God to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution says the President shall nominate and the Senate shall advise and consent. We ought to do just what we all have solemnly sworn to do. I take my oath very seriously. I hope other Senators do too. Now, Mr. President, today the full Senate is going to begin a discussion about one of the most challenging public health crises of our time--addiction to prescription painkillers and other opioids. In my home State of Vermont, there are few issues more pressing than opioid addiction. It is tearing apart families and communities-- families and communities I have known all my life. In March 2008, nearly 8 years ago, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I first held a hearing in Rutland, VT, about the challenges this epidemic presents in rural parts of our country. In subsequent field hearings, we learned about how communities like Rutland, VT--a beautiful community--were constructively seeking ways to get ahead of addiction. But we also learned--and I think we knew [[Page S1075]] this--that there are no easy answers, and we need a comprehensive approach. Education, prevention, and treatment are essential if we are to reverse the tide in this fight. Vermont's all-hands-on-deck example serves as a model for other States and communities across the Nation. In fact, just last week an article in the Christian Science Monitor detailed how Vermont's pioneering approach has been embraced well beyond Vermont's borders. So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Christian Science Monitor article entitled ``How one state turned its `heroin crisis' into a national lesson'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. Opioid addiction is not a new issue. It is not new to me, and it is not new to Vermont. But it is about time that the full Congress gave this public health crisis the attention it deserves. The bill we begin to consider today, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, represents a positive step forward, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of it. For decades, the knee-jerk response in Congress to those who struggled with addiction was misguided. We embraced harsh and arbitrary mandatory minimums, we ignored effective treatment options, and we pushed addicts further underground and away from recovery. Such policies reflect a complete misunderstanding of the problem of addiction. At my hearings and everywhere I went, we saw police officers, faith communities, educators, medical professionals, parents, and addicts coming together, saying that no one group had the answer but the community had to come together. Because we know addiction is a disease, we know our tools for combating addiction must be the same as other disease--a commitment to evidence-based education and proven techniques for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. As one who has served in law enforcement, I know that law enforcement is an important element in a comprehensive approach. That is why I worked to include in this bill an authorization for funding to expand State-led anti-heroin task forces. But this legislation is important because it treats addiction as the public health crisis that it is. The bill authorizes a crucial program that I helped create that expands access to medication-assisted treatment programs--programs that have been plagued by massive waiting lists. The clinic in Chittenden County, VT--that is the largest of our 14 counties--has seen its wait list lengthened to nearly a year. What happens when that wait list is long? Several people have overdosed and died while waiting for treatment. Those deaths were probably preventable. We shouldn't die waiting for treatment. We have to do better. The bill also recognizes the devastating impact that opioid abuse has on rural communities. Just as in your State and every other State, we have rural communities. Vermont is predominantly rural communities. My home where my wife and I have lived since we got married is on a dirt road. We know rural America. We know it has been hit hard by addiction. Emergency medical services in rural communities are often limited. I am glad that the bill we reported out of committee includes my provision to support our rural communities for the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Over the last decade, death rates from opioid overdoses have steadily climbed across the country. But there is a real disparity between rural communities and major cities. We found the more rural a location, the higher the death rate. Getting lifesaving drugs into more hands will save lives across the country, especially in our rural communities that are among the hardest hit. This is not a partisan issue. I thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator Grassley for working with me on this legislation in our Judiciary Committee. I hope we will soon see its passage here in the Senate. But one authorization bill by itself is not going to end addiction. It is not going to end the deaths that we are seeing in rural America and in urban America. We need a significant commitment of targeted funding to implement this bill. Senator Shaheen's $600 million emergency supplemental appropriations bill provides those resources, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation, as well. In your State, my State, and the other 48 States right now, we passed larger emergency supplemental bills that addressed swine flu and Ebola. We do not have Ebola in our country, but we passed an emergency supplemental bill to address that. We need to address what we have right here within our country today. Swine flu and Ebola presented far, far fewer dramatic health risks to our communities. We need to take this challenge just as seriously. The bill we are considering today has received strong bipartisan support and deservedly so. But I hope all the Senators supporting CARA today will also support Senator Shaheen's legislation. One goes hand in hand with the other. We need to authorize these advances in dealing with the opioid crisis, but then we actually need to fund them. We cannot pretend that solving a problem as large as opioid addiction costs nothing. We have an opportunity to equip our communities with the support and resources they need to finally get ahead of addiction. Programs will save lives. That is a worthy investment. It is very easy to say we will pass a law to stop opioid addiction. We can all feel good about voting for that. Who is going to vote for legislation to say ``let us continue opioid addiction''? But if we do not put the money in it, then, basically, we are saying we want to feel good but we are not going to do anything for you. We spend money worldwide. Some of it is for good causes, and some of it is totally wasted. Here we have a problem in the United States of America, where our priorities are first and foremost to our country. If you saw some of the people I heard in these hearings all over our beautiful State, some of the families with whom I have talked across their kitchen tables, and a young woman who had been addicted and is now helping to counsel others and the story she told, or if you saw a movie or TV program, you would say it couldn't be that grim. Well, it was. It is. These people go across all income brackets, all brackets of education. It is tearing apart parts of our communities across the country. Fortunately, we have had some very brave people stand up. I hope Senator Shaheen's appropriation goes through because, if it does not, we are saying all the right things, as we should, except for one thing: We are not going to pay for it. This is too important to say the check is in the mail; just wait and wait. We can do better. We can do better. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From The Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 23, 2016] How One State Turned Its `Heroin Crisis' Into a National Lesson (By Gail Russell Chaddock) Paths to Progress: Vermont's pioneering focus on treatment amid an opioid crisis is being embraced by politicians of both parties--well beyond the state. America's opioid addiction crisis, now claiming 78 lives a day, is sweeping aside party lines both at the state level and even in famously gridlocked Washington. The nation's governors, from deep-red Alabama to bluest-of- the-blue Vermont, are moving rapidly to a strategy of treating illegal drug users rather than jailing them. It's a shift that runs deep in public opinion, as well. Some two-thirds of Americans now typically say that they prefer providing treatment to long prison sentences. ``This is an area where I can get agreement from Bernie Sanders and Mitch McConnell,'' President Obama said at a White House meeting with governors on Monday. ``That doesn't happen that often, but this is one. And it indicates the severity of the issue.'' But the governors are, in fact, well ahead of Washington on this issue--as they were on welfare reform in the 1990s and, more recently, sentencing reform. Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) of Vermont, a leader in the pivot from prisons to treatment, says he got into the addiction fight after talking to people in his state. ``I found we were doing almost everything wrong,'' he told a forum on opioid and heroin addiction at The Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington on Friday. The best hope is to get more people into treatment, he said. And the best time to do that is ``when the blue lights are flashing and the handcuffs are on.'' Vermont, like other states in the Northeast, is facing severe opioid challenges. In 2014, Governor Shumlin devoted his annual State of the State address entirely to [[Page S1076]] Vermont's ``full-blown heroin crisis.'' Annual overdose deaths from opioids had nearly doubled since 2004. The number of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction had spiked 770 percent since 2000. what vermont has done And so Vermont has taken a hard look at its approach. Instead of jail, nonviolent offenders are given the option of going into treatment. They start in one of the state's new central clinics (hubs) and move on to a family doctor, counselor, or therapist closer to home (spokes). Vermont law also shields people seeking medical help for an overdose from prosecution for manufacturing or selling drugs, not just for minor crimes. It also was the first state to legalize the sale of naloxone over the counter in pharmacies--a drug aimed at reversing overdoses and saving lives. Other states have moved toward treatment instead of incarceration, but Vermont has done it on a grander scale, experts say. ``You've seen some elected officials support legalizing marijuana, some want to reform sentencing, some talk about overdoses, but very few have tied all these together in a comprehensive narrative,'' says Bill Piper, senior director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance in Washington. ``Vermont's governor is at the forefront, and what makes him unique is that he's one of the few elected officials that has connected the dots on the various issues,'' he adds. As a pioneer state, Vermont has also identified some of the limits of a treatment-centric strategy. ``As you build out treatment, and particularly in rural America, we can't get enough docs who are able to meet the demand of our waiting lists,'' Shumlin told the president at the White House meeting Monday. But the most important issue, he told Mr. Obama, is to ``come up with a more rational approach to prescribing prescription drugs.'' a bid to rein in prescriptions Governors see legal prescriptions for drugs like OxyContin as the gateway to heroin. ``Overprescribing of opioid painkillers has fueled the nation's addiction crisis,'' according to a report from the National Governors Association's Health and Human Services Committee. In a bid to rein in prescriptions, governors on that committee plan to develop a list of protocols to present to the full membership at the next NGA meeting in August. ``The United States represents 5 percent of the world's population and consumes 80 percent of the world's opioids,'' said Gov. Charlie Baker (R) of Massachusetts, who chairs the NGA's Health and Human Services Committee, on Saturday. That's ``fundamentally flawed.'' When prescriptions are too hard to get--or too expensive-- addicts switch to heroin. ``Most of the heroin addicts we treat started by using prescription opiates,'' says Brian McAlister, author of ``Full Recovery'' and CEO of the Full Recovery Wellness Center in Fairfield, N.J. ``Some were prescribed by a doctor or dentist, others were stolen from family or friends' medicine cabinets, and others were purchased illegally just to party--but the party ends very quickly. These drugs are highly addictive, and when the supply runs out, the problems get worse.'' at the national level The prospect of politicians reining in pharmaceutical sales is a stretch in the halls of Congress. In 1993, the GOP- controlled Congress explicitly barred government from negotiating lower drug prices with drug companies. Last year, Big Pharma spent more than $235 million to influence policy outcomes in Washington--the largest budget of any lobby group in Washington. Governors could set protocols on prescribing practices for painkillers on their own, Shumlin told the president. ``But it takes time,'' and ``it doesn't apply to all 50 states.'' Instead, he asked Obama to ``consider a national approach which simply says, for minor procedures, we're going to limit this to 10 pills and after that you've got to come back for more.'' ``To be candid, the docs, the AMA [American Medical Association] are resistant to listening to politicians like us talking about how many pills to prescribe. But is there something you could do on a national level that would help us get out of this tragic mess?'' he added. Obama answered, at length, but in the end deferred to the states. ``A very specific approach to working with the docs, the hospitals, the providers so that they are not overprescribing'' can be done at the national level, he said. ``But it is most profitably done, I think, if we have bipartisan support from the governors so that by the time it gets to the national level, there is consensus and there's not a lot of politics involved in it.'' In a recent blog, AMA president Steven Stack called the opioid epidemic a ``defining moment'' for the profession. ``Our nation is needlessly losing thousands of people to a preventable epidemic, and we must take action for our patients.'' Mr. LEAHY. I see nobody else seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask the time be equally divided. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 369, S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Mitch McConnell, Daniel Coats, Dan Sullivan, Orrin G. Hatch, Shelley Moore Capito, John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, Roy Blunt, Ron Johnson, Chuck Grassley, Rob Portman, Susan M. Collins, Jeff Flake, Cory Gardner, Lamar Alexander, John Barrasso, John McCain. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN.

Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) would have voted ``yea'', the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan) would have voted ``yea'', and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 89, nays 0, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 27 Leg.] YEAS--89 Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Stabenow Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NOT VOTING--11 Alexander Blunt Boozman Cruz McCaskill Rubio Sanders Shelby Sullivan Toomey Vitter The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays are 0. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, an historic epidemic of drug overdose deaths is gripping our country. Over 47,000 Americans died from overdoses in 2014, an alltime high. Incredibly, that is more deaths than resulted from either car crashes or gun violence. Addiction to opioids, primarily prescription pain killers and heroin, is driving this epidemic. It is destroying lives, families, and communities. It is a crisis. And it demands action. [[Page S1077]] Thankfully, the Senate can act this week, when we consider S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. CARA is a bipartisan bill authored by two Democrats and two Republicans--Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Klobuchar, and Ayotte. These Senators have shown extraordinary leadership on this issue. They deserve credit for crafting a bill that addresses many of the different aspects of this epidemic, through evidence-based solutions and best practices. This is a complex crisis that requires a multifaceted solution. Over the past few months, I have worked hard with the bill's authors to refine it and move it through the Judiciary Committee. I am proud to say that a few weeks ago it passed the committee on a voice vote, with no opposition. CARA is only the latest bipartisan legislative accomplishment by the Judiciary Committee this Congress. We have had 21 bills pass the Committee this Congress, all with bipartisan support. But there are a few major bills that stand out. Last April, the committee passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act unanimously, 19-0. The bill enhances penalties for human trafficking and equips law enforcement with new tools to target predators who traffic innocent young people. The bill passed the Senate 99-0 and was signed into law by the President. In October, the committee passed the landmark Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act with a strong 15-5 bipartisan vote. My bill would recalibrate prison sentences for certain drug offenders, target violent criminals, and grant judges greater discretion at sentencing for lower- level drug crimes. I am working hard to build additional support for the bill so that it can be taken up by the full Senate soon. Then in December, the committee passed my Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act, again without opposition. The bill will ensure that at-risk youth are fairly and effectively served by juvenile justice grant programs. Again, we are working hard to move this bill through the full Senate. The bipartisan reforms enacted by each of these bills address real problems that affect the lives of many people across the nation and in my home state of Iowa. I am proud of the work we have done so far--but there is a lot more to do. And that brings me back to the heroin and prescription drug epidemic. It isn't as bad in Iowa as it is in many areas of the country, but the eastern part of my State has been hit hard recently. The human cost of what is happening across so many of these communities is incalculable. Every life that is lost or changed forever by this epidemic is precious. Especially for many young people who fall victim to addiction early in their lives, there is so much human potential at stake. Many Iowans have heard the story of Kim Brown, a nurse from Davenport, and her son Andy. Andy was prescribed pain pills when he had surgery at age 14. Whether it was connected to abuse of those pain pills or not, he developed a drug problem as a teenager that he couldn't shake. He overdosed on heroin a few times but survived. And finally, at age 33, he died of an overdose, tragically leaving behind two young sons. Ms. Brown now speaks out around the State about the heroin epidemic. Her story reflects a larger pattern. Over the last 20 years or so, doctors have increasingly prescribed opioids to help their patients manage pain. For many, these medicines have been the answer to their prayers. But for others, they have led to a nightmare of addiction. According to numerous studies, prescription opioid addiction is a strong risk factor for heroin addiction. In some cases, those addicted to painkillers turn to heroin to get a similar high, because recently, it has become cheaper and more easily available. And as Ms. Brown's story reflects, this epidemic is a matter of life and death. In fact, nationally, heroin overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014. But Iowans are fighting back. Last year, with the assistance of a new Federal grant, the U.S. Attorney's office and the Cedar Rapids Police Department formed the Eastern Iowa Heroin Initiative. This partnership is focused on stemming the tide of heroin abuse through enforcement, prevention and treatment. I have been invited to participate in a townhall with them to discuss the epidemic, and I plan to do so soon. When I do, I want to tell them that the Senate has acted on this crisis by passing CARA. CARA supports so many of the efforts to help stem the tide of addiction that are underway in Iowa and across the country. As its name reflects, the bill addresses the epidemic comprehensively, supporting prevention, education, treatment, recovery, and law enforcement. CARA starts with prevention and education. It authorizes awareness and education campaigns, so that the public understands the dangers of becoming addicted to prescription painkillers. It creates a national task force to develop best prescribing practices, so that doctors don't expose their patients to unnecessary risks of addiction. The bill encourages the use of prescription drug monitoring programs like Iowa's, which helps detect and deter ``doctor shopping'' behavior by addicts. And the bill authorizes an expansion of the Federal initiative that allows patients to safely dispose of old or unused medications, so that these drugs don't fall into the hands of young people, potentially leading to addiction. In fact, along with a few other committee members, I helped start this ``take back'' program in 2010 through the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act. It has been a highly successful effort. Since 2010, over 2,700 tons of drugs have been collected from medicine cabinets and disposed of safely. Iowa also has a similar ``take back'' program that's expanding rapidly. CARA also focuses on treatment and recovery. The bill authorizes programs to provide first responders with training to use Naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and directly save lives. Naloxone was used hundreds of times by first responders in Iowa in 2014. Importantly, the bill provides that a set portion of Naloxone funding go to rural areas, like much of Iowa that is being affected most acutely. This is critical when someone overdoses and isn't near a hospital. The bill also authorizes an expansion of Drug Free Communities Act grants to those areas that are most dramatically affected by the opioid epidemic. And it also authorizes funds for programs that encourage the use of medication assisted treatment, provide community-based support for those in recovery, and address the unique needs of pregnant and postpartum women who are addicted to opioids. Finally, the bill also bolsters law enforcement efforts as well. Amazingly, in 2007, only 8 percent of State and local law enforcement officials across the country identified heroin as the greatest drug threat in their area. But by 2015, that number rose to 38 percent, more than any other drug. So the bill reauthorizes Federal funding for State task forces that specifically address heroin trafficking. I am also pleased that I was able to include in the bill a reauthorization of the funding for the methamphetamine law enforcement task forces as well. I held a Judiciary Committee field hearing in Des Moines last fall about the ongoing meth problem across Iowa. And one thing the hearing made clear is that our friends in State law enforcement need all the help we can give them on that front, too. All in all, the bill authorizes about $78 million per year to address this crisis. It is no wonder that the bill is supported by a diverse range of stakeholders, including the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, the National District Attorneys Association, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, and so many organizations in the treatment and recovery communities. I urge my colleagues to support it this week, when the Senate has the opportunity to act to address this epidemic. We owe it to those, like Kim Brown, who have lost sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, coworkers and friends to act now. [[Page S1078]] I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley. Many years ago I went to Iowa with Senator Grassley to set up an anti-drug coalition. We had done one in Ohio. I was the chair of that, and Chuck Grassley asked if I would come. This was probably 20 years ago that Senator Grassley--and I was in the House. We had a great visit. We had a couple of townhall meetings. Chuck Grassley is a guy who understands the issue, cares about it, and has devoted a lot of time and resources to it in Iowa. The people of Iowa know he is sincere about it because he has been on the ground setting up these coalitions and dealing with this issue. Frankly, it is a little disappointing--probably to him and to me--to see that some 20 years later we are still facing this issue now and even different issues. He mentioned methamphetamines. He mentioned, of course, the heroin and opiate addiction problems with prescription drugs. Twenty years ago it was more marijuana and cocaine, but I think the lesson we have all learned is these drugs will come and go in terms of their severity and their impact on our communities and our families, but it is always going to be there, and we need to keep up the fight. Right now we have an urgent problem. That urgent problem was outlined by Senator Grassley, but it is this growing use of opiates that leads to a horrible addiction. It has a grip on so many of our constituents, so many of our loved ones. Over the weekend I had a townhall meeting. I asked--after we had talked about taxes, trade, energy, and other issues--if people would just raise their hands if they had been affected by the heroin and prescription drug addiction problem. I said: Has anybody in your family and friends been affected? Half of the hands in the room went up. Unfortunately, that is the reality of this situation. In Ohio last year we lost almost 2,400 just to overdose deaths. That doesn't account for the fact that so many people are being saved now by naloxone--which is something that is encouraged by our legislation and we will talk about it in a second. Narcan is being used, but even those who survive the overdoses, of course, are seeing their families broken apart, their communities devastated. I talked to a prosecutor over the weekend in one of our more rural counties, and he said: Rob, over 80 percent of our crime is directly related to this issue now, heroin and prescription drugs. Often it is people committing crimes to pay for their habit. The people who are the purveyors of these drugs have a business plan; that is, to get you hooked with a relatively low cost at first and then you need more and more to be able to feel the same high. It gets more expensive to the point that it might go from $50 to $100 the first time to $1,000 or $1,500 a day by the end of your addiction. This is how horrible it is and it leads to so many collateral consequences. I am very pleased the Senate voted tonight to proceed to this legislation called CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. CARA is a Federal response to this issue. It is attempting to make the Federal Government a better partner with State and local governments, with nonprofits, to be able to help to reverse this tide to deal with this urgent problem in our communities. I would call it an epidemic. It certainly is at epidemic levels in my State of Ohio. Sadly, we are the top five in the country in terms of overdose deaths, but again it goes well beyond just those deaths. There are so many people who are affected by it negatively and so many who have not been able to fulfill their God-given purpose because of this horrible addiction. This legislation called CARA is bipartisan. It is comprehensive. As Senator Grassley said, he got it through the Judiciary Committee. I appreciate that. He got it through with something very extraordinary around here, which is a unanimous vote--meaning nobody objected. That never happens around here. It just means that every Senator is addressing this issue back home, understands it, and wants to do something about it. This legislation is built on common sense, research, and experts from around the country who have come in. I thank Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who is the lead Democrat on this legislation and my lead cosponsor. He and I are the coauthors of this legislation. I also thank Senators Kelly Ayotte and Amy Klobuchar, who have been terrific partners. Then there are 34 other bipartisan cosponsors. I thank them all for their support. I am excited that if this bill can pass, it will pass in the House as well because there is companion legislation. In fact, the House bill has 88 cosponsors right now--also bipartisan. So the idea is to get this bill passed, get it through the House, and have it signed into law by the President of the United States. It is urgent we do it. This is a bill that not only has a lot of support on both sides of the aisle, but--much more importantly to me--it has the support of people all over the country who are experts in this field: doctors; those in recovery; experts in prevention, treatment, and recovery; and law enforcement. The legislation actually comes--I hope you can see on this chart, the words are kind of small--but it comes from the last few years, putting together these experts from all around the country. We had five different summit meetings in Washington, DC. One was with the criminal justice system. We brought in experts from all around the country to talk about treatment and alternatives to incarceration. As you will see in this legislation, we have ways to divert people from incarceration into treatment programs, which we think is part of the way to solve this problem. We then had one that focused on women, the special interests and needs of women who are facing addiction and how to ensure they get into treatment. As we will talk about later, this has a lot to do with one of the problems that is out there right now, which is more and more babies who are born with addiction and having to take those babies through withdrawal. The care and compassion involved in that is truly impressive, but that was a good forum for us. We had one on the science of addiction and addressing the consequences of addiction. There are a lot of good people around the country who understand the science of this and what medication might work and what future medication might be better to deal with it. We talked about youth drug prevention and developing communities of recovery. This is a very important aspect of our legislation. We don't just talk about treatment, as important as that is, we talked about how you divert people from getting into it in the first place through better prevention and education. Finally, we had a forum on veterans focusing on substance abuse and PTSD and other issues. I recently visited one of our veterans courts in Columbus, OH, and saw the good work they are doing. Most people going through that court have mental health issues. Most also now have, sadly, opioid addiction issues, usually starting with prescription drugs and moving to heroin. As I said, there is strong bipartisan support for this legislation in the House and the Senate. It is endorsed by more than 130 groups nationwide. By the way, those groups include some groups you might not expect normally to be together on something such as this--the Fraternal Order of Police, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the Faces and Voices of Recovery, the Coalition for a Drug Free America, the Children's Hospital Association, the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers, the Partnership for Drug Free Kids, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, groups who are in all of our States, the National Council for Behavioral Health, and, of course, the Major County Sheriffs' Association. So law enforcement, treatment, recovery, education--everybody is coming together on this because we realize this is going to take that kind of comprehensive approach with all sectors of our community being involved and engaged. CARA now has support not only of a lot of these groups from around the country, but because of these groups--they helped us write a better bill. [[Page S1079]] What does the bill do? Here are the basic elements of CARA: First, with regard to prevention and education, it does establish new task forces to develop better practices for prescribers simply because there has been overprescribing, particularly of prescription drugs. These narcotics have been overprescribed to the point that many people end up on heroin as a less expensive alternative to the prescription drugs to which they have become addicted. The task force is an interagency task force that is reporting back to the Congress on how to develop these best practices for the medical community. The bill also establishes a national awareness campaign with regard to prevention and education. That is critical for us to get the word out. It has grants to local coalitions. This is in the Drug-Free Communities Act area. The Drug-Free Communities Act goes back to the 1990s. Since 1998 there has been $1.3 billion spent under the Drug-Free Communities Act. I was the author of that in the House. It is good legislation that helped create over 2,000 community coalitions around America. I chaired ours in Cincinnati, OH, for 9 years and am still very involved with it, and they do great work. But, again, we now have this new issue, this new threat we must address. This helps with regard to specific grants where there is a high degree of opioid addiction and the negative consequences of it, to be able to blend with the drug-free community program. Law enforcement. The bill provides for training for Narcan--what is known as naloxone--for first responders to prevent overdoses. I think everybody in this Chamber has run into this back home. I went to a firehouse recently because we had lost a brave firefighter in a house fire, and I went to talk to his shift about him and to thank them for their service. After talking to them about their fallen comrade, they wanted to talk about this issue. They told me: Rob, we are spending more time administering Narcan than we are fighting fires these days. In other words, they are going out and helping people who are having overdoses and are saving their lives. A friend of mine who is a firefighter in Cincinnati told me just a couple of weeks ago that he was responding to an overdose, saving someone in front of a house, when, in an entirely different group in the back of the house, an overdose occurred. In Toledo last week, there was a response by emergency medical services to somebody who had hit a telephone pole. They found him with a syringe in his arm. He had overdosed. While they were responding to him, there were two other overdose calls in Toledo--one city in Ohio. There were three at the same time. Two of the three were saved by Narcan. The third died. Our folks in law enforcement and our first responders, our firefighters, are doing a terrific job. They need help. They need more Narcan and more training to be sure they can continue to do what they are doing to prevent these overdoses. It is not the answer. Of course, the answer is prevention, education, and better treatment. But in the meantime, we have to provide them the help they need. The law enforcement side also expands these drug prescription take- back programs. They work very well, as Senator Grassley said, in some of our States. We need to do more to expand those, and that is usually done through our law enforcement communities. It also authorizes a task force to combat heroin and methamphetamines. These are the law enforcement task forces we talked about earlier, which will help to coordinate Federal, State, and local law enforcement to deal with this issue. On the treatment and recovery side, it expands medication assisted treatment for opioid and heroin addiction. It creates diversion, education, and treatment programs in the criminal justice system. We talked about that earlier. That is so important. I have been at roundtable discussions all around my State and at a number of treatment centers talking to recovering addicts about how they got into the situation they are in and what advice they have. A young man told me a classic story. He had an injury. He started using prescription drugs. He got addicted. He needed money to buy these expensive pain pills. He actually stole from a family member, and he ended up in the law enforcement system and in jail. It was in jail that he was told for the first time that it was actually cheaper to buy heroin. He got out and bought heroin and became a heroin addict. He is now in treatment. He hit rock bottom, as he said, and I think it was because he had an overdose. This is something where we need to figure out a better way to get people diverted and use the criminal justice system to provide the incentive to get them into the right treatment program. It also supports recovery for youth and building communities of recovery, again focusing on our youth to get them to make the right decisions but also steering our youth who are addicted into the recovery they need. Sadly, this is now necessary in many of our high schools and in our colleges and universities. It also establishes a task force to review some of the recovery and collateral consequences. This is an interagency task force that is going to report back to us on what is truly working and what is not working in order to do a deeper dive to ensure we are using this money most effectively in order to make a difference. It has treatment services for women and veterans included. This is a special interest of ours in this legislation--expanding treatment for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction, again to avoid this horrible situation where babies are born with an addiction. It also supports care for our veterans. Our veterans right now can enter treatment, of course, following discharge with this legislation. This is important. Our veterans have some special needs and special circumstances--often trauma, PTSD, and other things related to their addiction. We find these veterans courts are incredibly helpful, to be able to have them surrounded by fellow veterans in order to make more progress. That is in here as well. Finally, the legislation incentivizes the States themselves to enact comprehensive initiatives to address the opioid and heroin abuse problem--the prescription drug monitoring program, for instance. This is very important. The Federal Government has a big role to play here. Think about it. If you are in one State and you are monitoring someone's prescription drug medications, knowing where they are going and how much they are getting to avoid overprescribing, if that person crosses State lines, it is very difficult. So our legislation expands on what can be done there to ensure that, for instance, my State of Ohio knows whether someone has gone to Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, or Michigan to get prescription drugs. So the prescription drug monitoring program will work better for every State. Prevention and education on heroin abuses--this is to incentivize States to do a better job on the prevention and education side and, of course, to prevent overdose and to improve drug treatment. These are all aspects of this legislation. It is comprehensive because the problem is complex and requires a comprehensive approach. Here are some statistics--we have already talked about some this evening--that are shocking. We know that 28,647 Americans died in the last year for which we had data, which is 2014, from a drug overdose. The 2015 numbers will be higher than that. That is roughly 120 Americans dying every day. There were 27,000 diagnosed cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 2013, the last numbers we have. It is even worse this year. This means babies were born with an addiction. A baby is born dependent on opioids every 19 minutes in America. So while I am speaking today, there will be another baby born who is addicted. I have gone to hospitals in Cincinnati; in Lima, OH, to St. Rita's; to Rainbow Babies Children's Hospital in Cleveland, OH. They are incredible caregivers. My wife Jane was at Nationwide Children's Hospital today, actually, on this very issue. These are babies who are so tiny, you can almost hold them in the palm of your hand. They need caregivers to take them through a process where they go through withdrawal. And we are not [[Page S1080]] sure what the long-term consequences are because we don't have the data yet because this is such a new issue. There has been a substantial increase over the last several years. In Ohio, the same thing I said earlier--750 percent increase in the number of babies diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome since 2004. There has been a 750-percent increase in babies born addicted. These are the issues this legislation gets at. Again, it does so in a way that is not just bipartisan, which is important, and not just House and Senate, which is important--the House has its own companion bill, one the President will be able to sign into law--but most importantly, it is because of the input of people from all over this country, the experts, people who are recovering themselves, and those who are most affected by this, that this legislation makes sense, and not just for my State but for our country. The Judiciary Committee had a number of good witnesses. One was a woman named Tonda DaRe. Tonda DaRe is from Ohio. She had a daughter named Holly. On her 21st birthday, Holly, who had a bright future ahead of her--she was engaged to be married, and she had been very involved in her high school and active in sports--tried heroin for the first time. She became addicted. She went into recovery, and unfortunately, as in many cases, she had a relapse. At age 23 her young life ended in an overdose. Her mom, Tonda DaRe, set up an organization called Holly's Song of Hope. She testified before the Judiciary Committee about the importance of her work--talking to other mothers and fathers and sons and daughters about the devastating consequences of this heroin and prescription drug addiction. This legislation needs to be passed so that we can help Tonda. She testified on behalf of this legislation because she has looked at it and knows it will make a difference in her life and her community. This is an urgent problem, as I said earlier. It is also one we have a lot of bipartisan consensus around. There will be opportunities during this debate to hear from a lot of different people on a lot of different ideas on amendments to the legislation. That is good. It is good to have a debate. But I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will keep focused on the importance of getting this done. It is important to get it done in terms of providing immediate help to our communities and also providing a structure to more effectively spend funds this year--and yes, we have funds to spend this year that have been appropriated consistent with CARA--but also next year and the year after and the year after. Some will support more resources, and that is fine. We need to have that debate. I myself think it is a priority, and we should be providing the resources to be able to deal with this issue. I would also urge my colleagues to ensure that we get this over the finish line. It is too important. We can't play politics with it. This is one of those issues, again, like so few around here, that got out of the committee without a single dissenting vote. We have done the right thing on a bipartisan basis to bring in the experts. We have a good solution to an urgent problem we all face. I am pleased with the vote tonight, and I urge my colleagues to have a good debate on the floor. Let's get this done for the sake of Tonda DaRe and so many other mothers, fathers, and others out there who deserve to have a little help in their fight against opioid addiction. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to congratulate the Senator from Ohio for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. This is an epidemic that affects us all, and he has definitely been at the fore in providing exceptional leadership on this, and I want to commend him for that. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1074-S1080] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 524, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 369, S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their designees. The Senator from Vermont. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the senior Senator from Delaware. We have plenty of time to get a nomination to the Supreme Court from the President and to confirm a Justice, just as this body has done 12 times in Presidential election years. I think probably the most recent, of course, was when Democrats controlled the Senate and we confirmed unanimously President Reagan's nomination in an election year, his final year in office. So it can easily be done. Besides, let us just do our job. We get paid to be here and to do our job. We ought to do it. We also have the matter that each one of us has taken a very solemn oath before God to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution says the President shall nominate and the Senate shall advise and consent. We ought to do just what we all have solemnly sworn to do. I take my oath very seriously. I hope other Senators do too. Now, Mr. President, today the full Senate is going to begin a discussion about one of the most challenging public health crises of our time--addiction to prescription painkillers and other opioids. In my home State of Vermont, there are few issues more pressing than opioid addiction. It is tearing apart families and communities-- families and communities I have known all my life. In March 2008, nearly 8 years ago, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I first held a hearing in Rutland, VT, about the challenges this epidemic presents in rural parts of our country. In subsequent field hearings, we learned about how communities like Rutland, VT--a beautiful community--were constructively seeking ways to get ahead of addiction. But we also learned--and I think we knew [[Page S1075]] this--that there are no easy answers, and we need a comprehensive approach. Education, prevention, and treatment are essential if we are to reverse the tide in this fight. Vermont's all-hands-on-deck example serves as a model for other States and communities across the Nation. In fact, just last week an article in the Christian Science Monitor detailed how Vermont's pioneering approach has been embraced well beyond Vermont's borders. So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Christian Science Monitor article entitled ``How one state turned its `heroin crisis' into a national lesson'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. Opioid addiction is not a new issue. It is not new to me, and it is not new to Vermont. But it is about time that the full Congress gave this public health crisis the attention it deserves. The bill we begin to consider today, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, represents a positive step forward, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of it. For decades, the knee-jerk response in Congress to those who struggled with addiction was misguided. We embraced harsh and arbitrary mandatory minimums, we ignored effective treatment options, and we pushed addicts further underground and away from recovery. Such policies reflect a complete misunderstanding of the problem of addiction. At my hearings and everywhere I went, we saw police officers, faith communities, educators, medical professionals, parents, and addicts coming together, saying that no one group had the answer but the community had to come together. Because we know addiction is a disease, we know our tools for combating addiction must be the same as other disease--a commitment to evidence-based education and proven techniques for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. As one who has served in law enforcement, I know that law enforcement is an important element in a comprehensive approach. That is why I worked to include in this bill an authorization for funding to expand State-led anti-heroin task forces. But this legislation is important because it treats addiction as the public health crisis that it is. The bill authorizes a crucial program that I helped create that expands access to medication-assisted treatment programs--programs that have been plagued by massive waiting lists. The clinic in Chittenden County, VT--that is the largest of our 14 counties--has seen its wait list lengthened to nearly a year. What happens when that wait list is long? Several people have overdosed and died while waiting for treatment. Those deaths were probably preventable. We shouldn't die waiting for treatment. We have to do better. The bill also recognizes the devastating impact that opioid abuse has on rural communities. Just as in your State and every other State, we have rural communities. Vermont is predominantly rural communities. My home where my wife and I have lived since we got married is on a dirt road. We know rural America. We know it has been hit hard by addiction. Emergency medical services in rural communities are often limited. I am glad that the bill we reported out of committee includes my provision to support our rural communities for the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Over the last decade, death rates from opioid overdoses have steadily climbed across the country. But there is a real disparity between rural communities and major cities. We found the more rural a location, the higher the death rate. Getting lifesaving drugs into more hands will save lives across the country, especially in our rural communities that are among the hardest hit. This is not a partisan issue. I thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator Grassley for working with me on this legislation in our Judiciary Committee. I hope we will soon see its passage here in the Senate. But one authorization bill by itself is not going to end addiction. It is not going to end the deaths that we are seeing in rural America and in urban America. We need a significant commitment of targeted funding to implement this bill. Senator Shaheen's $600 million emergency supplemental appropriations bill provides those resources, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation, as well. In your State, my State, and the other 48 States right now, we passed larger emergency supplemental bills that addressed swine flu and Ebola. We do not have Ebola in our country, but we passed an emergency supplemental bill to address that. We need to address what we have right here within our country today. Swine flu and Ebola presented far, far fewer dramatic health risks to our communities. We need to take this challenge just as seriously. The bill we are considering today has received strong bipartisan support and deservedly so. But I hope all the Senators supporting CARA today will also support Senator Shaheen's legislation. One goes hand in hand with the other. We need to authorize these advances in dealing with the opioid crisis, but then we actually need to fund them. We cannot pretend that solving a problem as large as opioid addiction costs nothing. We have an opportunity to equip our communities with the support and resources they need to finally get ahead of addiction. Programs will save lives. That is a worthy investment. It is very easy to say we will pass a law to stop opioid addiction. We can all feel good about voting for that. Who is going to vote for legislation to say ``let us continue opioid addiction''? But if we do not put the money in it, then, basically, we are saying we want to feel good but we are not going to do anything for you. We spend money worldwide. Some of it is for good causes, and some of it is totally wasted. Here we have a problem in the United States of America, where our priorities are first and foremost to our country. If you saw some of the people I heard in these hearings all over our beautiful State, some of the families with whom I have talked across their kitchen tables, and a young woman who had been addicted and is now helping to counsel others and the story she told, or if you saw a movie or TV program, you would say it couldn't be that grim. Well, it was. It is. These people go across all income brackets, all brackets of education. It is tearing apart parts of our communities across the country. Fortunately, we have had some very brave people stand up. I hope Senator Shaheen's appropriation goes through because, if it does not, we are saying all the right things, as we should, except for one thing: We are not going to pay for it. This is too important to say the check is in the mail; just wait and wait. We can do better. We can do better. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From The Christian Science Monitor, Feb. 23, 2016] How One State Turned Its `Heroin Crisis' Into a National Lesson (By Gail Russell Chaddock) Paths to Progress: Vermont's pioneering focus on treatment amid an opioid crisis is being embraced by politicians of both parties--well beyond the state. America's opioid addiction crisis, now claiming 78 lives a day, is sweeping aside party lines both at the state level and even in famously gridlocked Washington. The nation's governors, from deep-red Alabama to bluest-of- the-blue Vermont, are moving rapidly to a strategy of treating illegal drug users rather than jailing them. It's a shift that runs deep in public opinion, as well. Some two-thirds of Americans now typically say that they prefer providing treatment to long prison sentences. ``This is an area where I can get agreement from Bernie Sanders and Mitch McConnell,'' President Obama said at a White House meeting with governors on Monday. ``That doesn't happen that often, but this is one. And it indicates the severity of the issue.'' But the governors are, in fact, well ahead of Washington on this issue--as they were on welfare reform in the 1990s and, more recently, sentencing reform. Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) of Vermont, a leader in the pivot from prisons to treatment, says he got into the addiction fight after talking to people in his state. ``I found we were doing almost everything wrong,'' he told a forum on opioid and heroin addiction at The Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington on Friday. The best hope is to get more people into treatment, he said. And the best time to do that is ``when the blue lights are flashing and the handcuffs are on.'' Vermont, like other states in the Northeast, is facing severe opioid challenges. In 2014, Governor Shumlin devoted his annual State of the State address entirely to [[Page S1076]] Vermont's ``full-blown heroin crisis.'' Annual overdose deaths from opioids had nearly doubled since 2004. The number of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction had spiked 770 percent since 2000. what vermont has done And so Vermont has taken a hard look at its approach. Instead of jail, nonviolent offenders are given the option of going into treatment. They start in one of the state's new central clinics (hubs) and move on to a family doctor, counselor, or therapist closer to home (spokes). Vermont law also shields people seeking medical help for an overdose from prosecution for manufacturing or selling drugs, not just for minor crimes. It also was the first state to legalize the sale of naloxone over the counter in pharmacies--a drug aimed at reversing overdoses and saving lives. Other states have moved toward treatment instead of incarceration, but Vermont has done it on a grander scale, experts say. ``You've seen some elected officials support legalizing marijuana, some want to reform sentencing, some talk about overdoses, but very few have tied all these together in a comprehensive narrative,'' says Bill Piper, senior director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance in Washington. ``Vermont's governor is at the forefront, and what makes him unique is that he's one of the few elected officials that has connected the dots on the various issues,'' he adds. As a pioneer state, Vermont has also identified some of the limits of a treatment-centric strategy. ``As you build out treatment, and particularly in rural America, we can't get enough docs who are able to meet the demand of our waiting lists,'' Shumlin told the president at the White House meeting Monday. But the most important issue, he told Mr. Obama, is to ``come up with a more rational approach to prescribing prescription drugs.'' a bid to rein in prescriptions Governors see legal prescriptions for drugs like OxyContin as the gateway to heroin. ``Overprescribing of opioid painkillers has fueled the nation's addiction crisis,'' according to a report from the National Governors Association's Health and Human Services Committee. In a bid to rein in prescriptions, governors on that committee plan to develop a list of protocols to present to the full membership at the next NGA meeting in August. ``The United States represents 5 percent of the world's population and consumes 80 percent of the world's opioids,'' said Gov. Charlie Baker (R) of Massachusetts, who chairs the NGA's Health and Human Services Committee, on Saturday. That's ``fundamentally flawed.'' When prescriptions are too hard to get--or too expensive-- addicts switch to heroin. ``Most of the heroin addicts we treat started by using prescription opiates,'' says Brian McAlister, author of ``Full Recovery'' and CEO of the Full Recovery Wellness Center in Fairfield, N.J. ``Some were prescribed by a doctor or dentist, others were stolen from family or friends' medicine cabinets, and others were purchased illegally just to party--but the party ends very quickly. These drugs are highly addictive, and when the supply runs out, the problems get worse.'' at the national level The prospect of politicians reining in pharmaceutical sales is a stretch in the halls of Congress. In 1993, the GOP- controlled Congress explicitly barred government from negotiating lower drug prices with drug companies. Last year, Big Pharma spent more than $235 million to influence policy outcomes in Washington--the largest budget of any lobby group in Washington. Governors could set protocols on prescribing practices for painkillers on their own, Shumlin told the president. ``But it takes time,'' and ``it doesn't apply to all 50 states.'' Instead, he asked Obama to ``consider a national approach which simply says, for minor procedures, we're going to limit this to 10 pills and after that you've got to come back for more.'' ``To be candid, the docs, the AMA [American Medical Association] are resistant to listening to politicians like us talking about how many pills to prescribe. But is there something you could do on a national level that would help us get out of this tragic mess?'' he added. Obama answered, at length, but in the end deferred to the states. ``A very specific approach to working with the docs, the hospitals, the providers so that they are not overprescribing'' can be done at the national level, he said. ``But it is most profitably done, I think, if we have bipartisan support from the governors so that by the time it gets to the national level, there is consensus and there's not a lot of politics involved in it.'' In a recent blog, AMA president Steven Stack called the opioid epidemic a ``defining moment'' for the profession. ``Our nation is needlessly losing thousands of people to a preventable epidemic, and we must take action for our patients.'' Mr. LEAHY. I see nobody else seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask the time be equally divided. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 369, S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Mitch McConnell, Daniel Coats, Dan Sullivan, Orrin G. Hatch, Shelley Moore Capito, John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, Roy Blunt, Ron Johnson, Chuck Grassley, Rob Portman, Susan M. Collins, Jeff Flake, Cory Gardner, Lamar Alexander, John Barrasso, John McCain. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN.

On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays are 0. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, an historic epidemic of drug overdose deaths is gripping our country. Over 47,000 Americans died from overdoses in 2014, an alltime high. Incredibly, that is more deaths than resulted from either car crashes or gun violence. Addiction to opioids, primarily prescription pain killers and heroin, is driving this epidemic. It is destroying lives, families, and communities. It is a crisis. And it demands action. [[Page S1077]] Thankfully, the Senate can act this week, when we consider S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. CARA is a bipartisan bill authored by two Democrats and two Republicans--Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Klobuchar, and Ayotte. These Senators have shown extraordinary leadership on this issue. They deserve credit for crafting a bill that addresses many of the different aspects of this epidemic, through evidence-based solutions and best practices. This is a complex crisis that requires a multifaceted solution. Over the past few months, I have worked hard with the bill's authors to refine it and move it through the Judiciary Committee. I am proud to say that a few weeks ago it passed the committee on a voice vote, with no opposition. CARA is only the latest bipartisan legislative accomplishment by the Judiciary Committee this Congress. We have had 21 bills pass the Committee this Congress, all with bipartisan support. But there are a few major bills that stand out. Last April, the committee passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act unanimously, 19-0. The bill enhances penalties for human trafficking and equips law enforcement with new tools to target predators who traffic innocent young people. The bill passed the Senate 99-0 and was signed into law by the President. In October, the committee passed the landmark Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act with a strong 15-5 bipartisan vote. My bill would recalibrate prison sentences for certain drug offenders, target violent criminals, and grant judges greater discretion at sentencing for lower- level drug crimes. I am working hard to build additional support for the bill so that it can be taken up by the full Senate soon. Then in December, the committee passed my Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act, again without opposition. The bill will ensure that at-risk youth are fairly and effectively served by juvenile justice grant programs. Again, we are working hard to move this bill through the full Senate. The bipartisan reforms enacted by each of these bills address real problems that affect the lives of many people across the nation and in my home state of Iowa. I am proud of the work we have done so far--but there is a lot more to do. And that brings me back to the heroin and prescription drug epidemic. It isn't as bad in Iowa as it is in many areas of the country, but the eastern part of my State has been hit hard recently. The human cost of what is happening across so many of these communities is incalculable. Every life that is lost or changed forever by this epidemic is precious. Especially for many young people who fall victim to addiction early in their lives, there is so much human potential at stake. Many Iowans have heard the story of Kim Brown, a nurse from Davenport, and her son Andy. Andy was prescribed pain pills when he had surgery at age 14. Whether it was connected to abuse of those pain pills or not, he developed a drug problem as a teenager that he couldn't shake. He overdosed on heroin a few times but survived. And finally, at age 33, he died of an overdose, tragically leaving behind two young sons. Ms. Brown now speaks out around the State about the heroin epidemic. Her story reflects a larger pattern. Over the last 20 years or so, doctors have increasingly prescribed opioids to help their patients manage pain. For many, these medicines have been the answer to their prayers. But for others, they have led to a nightmare of addiction. According to numerous studies, prescription opioid addiction is a strong risk factor for heroin addiction. In some cases, those addicted to painkillers turn to heroin to get a similar high, because recently, it has become cheaper and more easily available. And as Ms. Brown's story reflects, this epidemic is a matter of life and death. In fact, nationally, heroin overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014. But Iowans are fighting back. Last year, with the assistance of a new Federal grant, the U.S. Attorney's office and the Cedar Rapids Police Department formed the Eastern Iowa Heroin Initiative. This partnership is focused on stemming the tide of heroin abuse through enforcement, prevention and treatment. I have been invited to participate in a townhall with them to discuss the epidemic, and I plan to do so soon. When I do, I want to tell them that the Senate has acted on this crisis by passing CARA. CARA supports so many of the efforts to help stem the tide of addiction that are underway in Iowa and across the country. As its name reflects, the bill addresses the epidemic comprehensively, supporting prevention, education, treatment, recovery, and law enforcement. CARA starts with prevention and education. It authorizes awareness and education campaigns, so that the public understands the dangers of becoming addicted to prescription painkillers. It creates a national task force to develop best prescribing practices, so that doctors don't expose their patients to unnecessary risks of addiction. The bill encourages the use of prescription drug monitoring programs like Iowa's, which helps detect and deter ``doctor shopping'' behavior by addicts. And the bill authorizes an expansion of the Federal initiative that allows patients to safely dispose of old or unused medications, so that these drugs don't fall into the hands of young people, potentially leading to addiction. In fact, along with a few other committee members, I helped start this ``take back'' program in 2010 through the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act. It has been a highly successful effort. Since 2010, over 2,700 tons of drugs have been collected from medicine cabinets and disposed of safely. Iowa also has a similar ``take back'' program that's expanding rapidly. CARA also focuses on treatment and recovery. The bill authorizes programs to provide first responders with training to use Naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and directly save lives. Naloxone was used hundreds of times by first responders in Iowa in 2014. Importantly, the bill provides that a set portion of Naloxone funding go to rural areas, like much of Iowa that is being affected most acutely. This is critical when someone overdoses and isn't near a hospital. The bill also authorizes an expansion of Drug Free Communities Act grants to those areas that are most dramatically affected by the opioid epidemic. And it also authorizes funds for programs that encourage the use of medication assisted treatment, provide community-based support for those in recovery, and address the unique needs of pregnant and postpartum women who are addicted to opioids. Finally, the bill also bolsters law enforcement efforts as well. Amazingly, in 2007, only 8 percent of State and local law enforcement officials across the country identified heroin as the greatest drug threat in their area. But by 2015, that number rose to 38 percent, more than any other drug. So the bill reauthorizes Federal funding for State task forces that specifically address heroin trafficking. I am also pleased that I was able to include in the bill a reauthorization of the funding for the methamphetamine law enforcement task forces as well. I held a Judiciary Committee field hearing in Des Moines last fall about the ongoing meth problem across Iowa. And one thing the hearing made clear is that our friends in State law enforcement need all the help we can give them on that front, too. All in all, the bill authorizes about $78 million per year to address this crisis. It is no wonder that the bill is supported by a diverse range of stakeholders, including the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, the National District Attorneys Association, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, and so many organizations in the treatment and recovery communities. I urge my colleagues to support it this week, when the Senate has the opportunity to act to address this epidemic. We owe it to those, like Kim Brown, who have lost sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, coworkers and friends to act now. [[Page S1078]] I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley. Many years ago I went to Iowa with Senator Grassley to set up an anti-drug coalition. We had done one in Ohio. I was the chair of that, and Chuck Grassley asked if I would come. This was probably 20 years ago that Senator Grassley--and I was in the House. We had a great visit. We had a couple of townhall meetings. Chuck Grassley is a guy who understands the issue, cares about it, and has devoted a lot of time and resources to it in Iowa. The people of Iowa know he is sincere about it because he has been on the ground setting up these coalitions and dealing with this issue. Frankly, it is a little disappointing--probably to him and to me--to see that some 20 years later we are still facing this issue now and even different issues. He mentioned methamphetamines. He mentioned, of course, the heroin and opiate addiction problems with prescription drugs. Twenty years ago it was more marijuana and cocaine, but I think the lesson we have all learned is these drugs will come and go in terms of their severity and their impact on our communities and our families, but it is always going to be there, and we need to keep up the fight. Right now we have an urgent problem. That urgent problem was outlined by Senator Grassley, but it is this growing use of opiates that leads to a horrible addiction. It has a grip on so many of our constituents, so many of our loved ones. Over the weekend I had a townhall meeting. I asked--after we had talked about taxes, trade, energy, and other issues--if people would just raise their hands if they had been affected by the heroin and prescription drug addiction problem. I said: Has anybody in your family and friends been affected? Half of the hands in the room went up. Unfortunately, that is the reality of this situation. In Ohio last year we lost almost 2,400 just to overdose deaths. That doesn't account for the fact that so many people are being saved now by naloxone--which is something that is encouraged by our legislation and we will talk about it in a second. Narcan is being used, but even those who survive the overdoses, of course, are seeing their families broken apart, their communities devastated. I talked to a prosecutor over the weekend in one of our more rural counties, and he said: Rob, over 80 percent of our crime is directly related to this issue now, heroin and prescription drugs. Often it is people committing crimes to pay for their habit. The people who are the purveyors of these drugs have a business plan; that is, to get you hooked with a relatively low cost at first and then you need more and more to be able to feel the same high. It gets more expensive to the point that it might go from $50 to $100 the first time to $1,000 or $1,500 a day by the end of your addiction. This is how horrible it is and it leads to so many collateral consequences. I am very pleased the Senate voted tonight to proceed to this legislation called CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. CARA is a Federal response to this issue. It is attempting to make the Federal Government a better partner with State and local governments, with nonprofits, to be able to help to reverse this tide to deal with this urgent problem in our communities. I would call it an epidemic. It certainly is at epidemic levels in my State of Ohio. Sadly, we are the top five in the country in terms of overdose deaths, but again it goes well beyond just those deaths. There are so many people who are affected by it negatively and so many who have not been able to fulfill their God-given purpose because of this horrible addiction. This legislation called CARA is bipartisan. It is comprehensive. As Senator Grassley said, he got it through the Judiciary Committee. I appreciate that. He got it through with something very extraordinary around here, which is a unanimous vote--meaning nobody objected. That never happens around here. It just means that every Senator is addressing this issue back home, understands it, and wants to do something about it. This legislation is built on common sense, research, and experts from around the country who have come in. I thank Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who is the lead Democrat on this legislation and my lead cosponsor. He and I are the coauthors of this legislation. I also thank Senators Kelly Ayotte and Amy Klobuchar, who have been terrific partners. Then there are 34 other bipartisan cosponsors. I thank them all for their support. I am excited that if this bill can pass, it will pass in the House as well because there is companion legislation. In fact, the House bill has 88 cosponsors right now--also bipartisan. So the idea is to get this bill passed, get it through the House, and have it signed into law by the President of the United States. It is urgent we do it. This is a bill that not only has a lot of support on both sides of the aisle, but--much more importantly to me--it has the support of people all over the country who are experts in this field: doctors; those in recovery; experts in prevention, treatment, and recovery; and law enforcement. The legislation actually comes--I hope you can see on this chart, the words are kind of small--but it comes from the last few years, putting together these experts from all around the country. We had five different summit meetings in Washington, DC. One was with the criminal justice system. We brought in experts from all around the country to talk about treatment and alternatives to incarceration. As you will see in this legislation, we have ways to divert people from incarceration into treatment programs, which we think is part of the way to solve this problem. We then had one that focused on women, the special interests and needs of women who are facing addiction and how to ensure they get into treatment. As we will talk about later, this has a lot to do with one of the problems that is out there right now, which is more and more babies who are born with addiction and having to take those babies through withdrawal. The care and compassion involved in that is truly impressive, but that was a good forum for us. We had one on the science of addiction and addressing the consequences of addiction. There are a lot of good people around the country who understand the science of this and what medication might work and what future medication might be better to deal with it. We talked about youth drug prevention and developing communities of recovery. This is a very important aspect of our legislation. We don't just talk about treatment, as important as that is, we talked about how you divert people from getting into it in the first place through better prevention and education. Finally, we had a forum on veterans focusing on substance abuse and PTSD and other issues. I recently visited one of our veterans courts in Columbus, OH, and saw the good work they are doing. Most people going through that court have mental health issues. Most also now have, sadly, opioid addiction issues, usually starting with prescription drugs and moving to heroin. As I said, there is strong bipartisan support for this legislation in the House and the Senate. It is endorsed by more than 130 groups nationwide. By the way, those groups include some groups you might not expect normally to be together on something such as this--the Fraternal Order of Police, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the Faces and Voices of Recovery, the Coalition for a Drug Free America, the Children's Hospital Association, the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers, the Partnership for Drug Free Kids, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, groups who are in all of our States, the National Council for Behavioral Health, and, of course, the Major County Sheriffs' Association. So law enforcement, treatment, recovery, education--everybody is coming together on this because we realize this is going to take that kind of comprehensive approach with all sectors of our community being involved and engaged. CARA now has support not only of a lot of these groups from around the country, but because of these groups--they helped us write a better bill. [[Page S1079]] What does the bill do? Here are the basic elements of CARA: First, with regard to prevention and education, it does establish new task forces to develop better practices for prescribers simply because there has been overprescribing, particularly of prescription drugs. These narcotics have been overprescribed to the point that many people end up on heroin as a less expensive alternative to the prescription drugs to which they have become addicted. The task force is an interagency task force that is reporting back to the Congress on how to develop these best practices for the medical community. The bill also establishes a national awareness campaign with regard to prevention and education. That is critical for us to get the word out. It has grants to local coalitions. This is in the Drug-Free Communities Act area. The Drug-Free Communities Act goes back to the 1990s. Since 1998 there has been $1.3 billion spent under the Drug-Free Communities Act. I was the author of that in the House. It is good legislation that helped create over 2,000 community coalitions around America. I chaired ours in Cincinnati, OH, for 9 years and am still very involved with it, and they do great work. But, again, we now have this new issue, this new threat we must address. This helps with regard to specific grants where there is a high degree of opioid addiction and the negative consequences of it, to be able to blend with the drug-free community program. Law enforcement. The bill provides for training for Narcan--what is known as naloxone--for first responders to prevent overdoses. I think everybody in this Chamber has run into this back home. I went to a firehouse recently because we had lost a brave firefighter in a house fire, and I went to talk to his shift about him and to thank them for their service. After talking to them about their fallen comrade, they wanted to talk about this issue. They told me: Rob, we are spending more time administering Narcan than we are fighting fires these days. In other words, they are going out and helping people who are having overdoses and are saving their lives. A friend of mine who is a firefighter in Cincinnati told me just a couple of weeks ago that he was responding to an overdose, saving someone in front of a house, when, in an entirely different group in the back of the house, an overdose occurred. In Toledo last week, there was a response by emergency medical services to somebody who had hit a telephone pole. They found him with a syringe in his arm. He had overdosed. While they were responding to him, there were two other overdose calls in Toledo--one city in Ohio. There were three at the same time. Two of the three were saved by Narcan. The third died. Our folks in law enforcement and our first responders, our firefighters, are doing a terrific job. They need help. They need more Narcan and more training to be sure they can continue to do what they are doing to prevent these overdoses. It is not the answer. Of course, the answer is prevention, education, and better treatment. But in the meantime, we have to provide them the help they need. The law enforcement side also expands these drug prescription take- back programs. They work very well, as Senator Grassley said, in some of our States. We need to do more to expand those, and that is usually done through our law enforcement communities. It also authorizes a task force to combat heroin and methamphetamines. These are the law enforcement task forces we talked about earlier, which will help to coordinate Federal, State, and local law enforcement to deal with this issue. On the treatment and recovery side, it expands medication assisted treatment for opioid and heroin addiction. It creates diversion, education, and treatment programs in the criminal justice system. We talked about that earlier. That is so important. I have been at roundtable discussions all around my State and at a number of treatment centers talking to recovering addicts about how they got into the situation they are in and what advice they have. A young man told me a classic story. He had an injury. He started using prescription drugs. He got addicted. He needed money to buy these expensive pain pills. He actually stole from a family member, and he ended up in the law enforcement system and in jail. It was in jail that he was told for the first time that it was actually cheaper to buy heroin. He got out and bought heroin and became a heroin addict. He is now in treatment. He hit rock bottom, as he said, and I think it was because he had an overdose. This is something where we need to figure out a better way to get people diverted and use the criminal justice system to provide the incentive to get them into the right treatment program. It also supports recovery for youth and building communities of recovery, again focusing on our youth to get them to make the right decisions but also steering our youth who are addicted into the recovery they need. Sadly, this is now necessary in many of our high schools and in our colleges and universities. It also establishes a task force to review some of the recovery and collateral consequences. This is an interagency task force that is going to report back to us on what is truly working and what is not working in order to do a deeper dive to ensure we are using this money most effectively in order to make a difference. It has treatment services for women and veterans included. This is a special interest of ours in this legislation--expanding treatment for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction, again to avoid this horrible situation where babies are born with an addiction. It also supports care for our veterans. Our veterans right now can enter treatment, of course, following discharge with this legislation. This is important. Our veterans have some special needs and special circumstances--often trauma, PTSD, and other things related to their addiction. We find these veterans courts are incredibly helpful, to be able to have them surrounded by fellow veterans in order to make more progress. That is in here as well. Finally, the legislation incentivizes the States themselves to enact comprehensive initiatives to address the opioid and heroin abuse problem--the prescription drug monitoring program, for instance. This is very important. The Federal Government has a big role to play here. Think about it. If you are in one State and you are monitoring someone's prescription drug medications, knowing where they are going and how much they are getting to avoid overprescribing, if that person crosses State lines, it is very difficult. So our legislation expands on what can be done there to ensure that, for instance, my State of Ohio knows whether someone has gone to Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, or Michigan to get prescription drugs. So the prescription drug monitoring program will work better for every State. Prevention and education on heroin abuses--this is to incentivize States to do a better job on the prevention and education side and, of course, to prevent overdose and to improve drug treatment. These are all aspects of this legislation. It is comprehensive because the problem is complex and requires a comprehensive approach. Here are some statistics--we have already talked about some this evening--that are shocking. We know that 28,647 Americans died in the last year for which we had data, which is 2014, from a drug overdose. The 2015 numbers will be higher than that. That is roughly 120 Americans dying every day. There were 27,000 diagnosed cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 2013, the last numbers we have. It is even worse this year. This means babies were born with an addiction. A baby is born dependent on opioids every 19 minutes in America. So while I am speaking today, there will be another baby born who is addicted. I have gone to hospitals in Cincinnati; in Lima, OH, to St. Rita's; to Rainbow Babies Children's Hospital in Cleveland, OH. They are incredible caregivers. My wife Jane was at Nationwide Children's Hospital today, actually, on this very issue. These are babies who are so tiny, you can almost hold them in the palm of your hand. They need caregivers to take them through a process where they go through withdrawal. And we are not [[Page S1080]] sure what the long-term consequences are because we don't have the data yet because this is such a new issue. There has been a substantial increase over the last several years. In Ohio, the same thing I said earlier--750 percent increase in the number of babies diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome since 2004. There has been a 750-percent increase in babies born addicted. These are the issues this legislation gets at. Again, it does so in a way that is not just bipartisan, which is important, and not just House and Senate, which is important--the House has its own companion bill, one the President will be able to sign into law--but most importantly, it is because of the input of people from all over this country, the experts, people who are recovering themselves, and those who are most affected by this, that this legislation makes sense, and not just for my State but for our country. The Judiciary Committee had a number of good witnesses. One was a woman named Tonda DaRe. Tonda DaRe is from Ohio. She had a daughter named Holly. On her 21st birthday, Holly, who had a bright future ahead of her--she was engaged to be married, and she had been very involved in her high school and active in sports--tried heroin for the first time. She became addicted. She went into recovery, and unfortunately, as in many cases, she had a relapse. At age 23 her young life ended in an overdose. Her mom, Tonda DaRe, set up an organization called Holly's Song of Hope. She testified before the Judiciary Committee about the importance of her work--talking to other mothers and fathers and sons and daughters about the devastating consequences of this heroin and prescription drug addiction. This legislation needs to be passed so that we can help Tonda. She testified on behalf of this legislation because she has looked at it and knows it will make a difference in her life and her community. This is an urgent problem, as I said earlier. It is also one we have a lot of bipartisan consensus around. There will be opportunities during this debate to hear from a lot of different people on a lot of different ideas on amendments to the legislation. That is good. It is good to have a debate. But I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will keep focused on the importance of getting this done. It is important to get it done in terms of providing immediate help to our communities and also providing a structure to more effectively spend funds this year--and yes, we have funds to spend this year that have been appropriated consistent with CARA--but also next year and the year after and the year after. Some will support more resources, and that is fine. We need to have that debate. I myself think it is a priority, and we should be providing the resources to be able to deal with this issue. I would also urge my colleagues to ensure that we get this over the finish line. It is too important. We can't play politics with it. This is one of those issues, again, like so few around here, that got out of the committee without a single dissenting vote. We have done the right thing on a bipartisan basis to bring in the experts. We have a good solution to an urgent problem we all face. I am pleased with the vote tonight, and I urge my colleagues to have a good debate on the floor. Let's get this done for the sake of Tonda DaRe and so many other mothers, fathers, and others out there who deserve to have a little help in their fight against opioid addiction. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to congratulate the Senator from Ohio for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. This is an epidemic that affects us all, and he has definitely been at the fore in providing exceptional leadership on this, and I want to commend him for that.

through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] comprehensive addiction and recovery act of 2015--motion to proceed the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to s. 524, which the clerk will report. the bill clerk read as follows: motion to proceed to calendar no. 369, s. 524, a bill to authorize the attorney general to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. the presiding officer. under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their designees. the senator from vermont. filling the supreme court vacancy mr. leahy. mr. president, i appreciate the comments of the senior senator from delaware. we have plenty of time to get a nomination to the supreme court from the president and to confirm a justice, just as this body has done 12 times in presidential election years. i think probably the most recent, of course, was when democrats controlled the senate and we confirmed unanimously president reagan's nomination in an election year, his final year in office. so it can easily be done. besides, let us just do our job. we get paid to be here and to do our job. we ought to do it. we also have the matter that each one of us has taken a very solemn oath before god to uphold the constitution. the constitution says the president shall nominate and the senate shall advise and consent. we ought to do just what we all have solemnly sworn to do. i take my oath very seriously. i hope other senators do too. now, mr. president, today the full senate is going to begin a discussion about one of the most challenging public health crises of our time--addiction to prescription painkillers and other opioids. in my home state of vermont, there are few issues more pressing than opioid addiction. it is tearing apart families and communities-- families and communities i have known all my life. in march 2008, nearly 8 years ago, when i was chairman of the judiciary committee, i first held a hearing in rutland, vt, about the challenges this epidemic presents in rural parts of our country. in subsequent field hearings, we learned about how communities like rutland, vt--a beautiful community--were constructively seeking ways to get ahead of addiction. but we also learned--and i think we knew [[page s1075]] this--that there are no easy answers, and we need a comprehensive approach. education, prevention, and treatment are essential if we are to reverse the tide in this fight. vermont's all-hands-on-deck example serves as a model for other states and communities across the nation. in fact, just last week an article in the christian science monitor detailed how vermont's pioneering approach has been embraced well beyond vermont's borders. so, mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the christian science monitor article entitled ``how one state turned its `heroin crisis' into a national lesson'' be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. opioid addiction is not a new issue. it is not new to me, and it is not new to vermont. but it is about time that the full congress gave this public health crisis the attention it deserves. the bill we begin to consider today, the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, or cara, represents a positive step forward, and i am proud to be a cosponsor of it. for decades, the knee-jerk response in congress to those who struggled with addiction was misguided. we embraced harsh and arbitrary mandatory minimums, we ignored effective treatment options, and we pushed addicts further underground and away from recovery. such policies reflect a complete misunderstanding of the problem of addiction. at my hearings and everywhere i went, we saw police officers, faith communities, educators, medical professionals, parents, and addicts coming together, saying that no one group had the answer but the community had to come together. because we know addiction is a disease, we know our tools for combating addiction must be the same as other disease--a commitment to evidence-based education and proven techniques for prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. as one who has served in law enforcement, i know that law enforcement is an important element in a comprehensive approach. that is why i worked to include in this bill an authorization for funding to expand state-led anti-heroin task forces. but this legislation is important because it treats addiction as the public health crisis that it is. the bill authorizes a crucial program that i helped create that expands access to medication-assisted treatment programs--programs that have been plagued by massive waiting lists. the clinic in chittenden county, vt--that is the largest of our 14 counties--has seen its wait list lengthened to nearly a year. what happens when that wait list is long? several people have overdosed and died while waiting for treatment. those deaths were probably preventable. we shouldn't die waiting for treatment. we have to do better. the bill also recognizes the devastating impact that opioid abuse has on rural communities. just as in your state and every other state, we have rural communities. vermont is predominantly rural communities. my home where my wife and i have lived since we got married is on a dirt road. we know rural america. we know it has been hit hard by addiction. emergency medical services in rural communities are often limited. i am glad that the bill we reported out of committee includes my provision to support our rural communities for the overdose reversal drug naloxone. over the last decade, death rates from opioid overdoses have steadily climbed across the country. but there is a real disparity between rural communities and major cities. we found the more rural a location, the higher the death rate. getting lifesaving drugs into more hands will save lives across the country, especially in our rural communities that are among the hardest hit. this is not a partisan issue. i thank senator whitehouse and senator grassley for working with me on this legislation in our judiciary committee. i hope we will soon see its passage here in the senate. but one authorization bill by itself is not going to end addiction. it is not going to end the deaths that we are seeing in rural america and in urban america. we need a significant commitment of targeted funding to implement this bill. senator shaheen's $600 million emergency supplemental appropriations bill provides those resources, and i am proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation, as well. in your state, my state, and the other 48 states right now, we passed larger emergency supplemental bills that addressed swine flu and ebola. we do not have ebola in our country, but we passed an emergency supplemental bill to address that. we need to address what we have right here within our country today. swine flu and ebola presented far, far fewer dramatic health risks to our communities. we need to take this challenge just as seriously. the bill we are considering today has received strong bipartisan support and deservedly so. but i hope all the senators supporting cara today will also support senator shaheen's legislation. one goes hand in hand with the other. we need to authorize these advances in dealing with the opioid crisis, but then we actually need to fund them. we cannot pretend that solving a problem as large as opioid addiction costs nothing. we have an opportunity to equip our communities with the support and resources they need to finally get ahead of addiction. programs will save lives. that is a worthy investment. it is very easy to say we will pass a law to stop opioid addiction. we can all feel good about voting for that. who is going to vote for legislation to say ``let us continue opioid addiction''? but if we do not put the money in it, then, basically, we are saying we want to feel good but we are not going to do anything for you. we spend money worldwide. some of it is for good causes, and some of it is totally wasted. here we have a problem in the united states of america, where our priorities are first and foremost to our country. if you saw some of the people i heard in these hearings all over our beautiful state, some of the families with whom i have talked across their kitchen tables, and a young woman who had been addicted and is now helping to counsel others and the story she told, or if you saw a movie or tv program, you would say it couldn't be that grim. well, it was. it is. these people go across all income brackets, all brackets of education. it is tearing apart parts of our communities across the country. fortunately, we have had some very brave people stand up. i hope senator shaheen's appropriation goes through because, if it does not, we are saying all the right things, as we should, except for one thing: we are not going to pay for it. this is too important to say the check is in the mail; just wait and wait. we can do better. we can do better. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from the christian science monitor, feb. 23, 2016] how one state turned its `heroin crisis' into a national lesson (by gail russell chaddock) paths to progress: vermont's pioneering focus on treatment amid an opioid crisis is being embraced by politicians of both parties--well beyond the state. america's opioid addiction crisis, now claiming 78 lives a day, is sweeping aside party lines both at the state level and even in famously gridlocked washington. the nation's governors, from deep-red alabama to bluest-of- the-blue vermont, are moving rapidly to a strategy of treating illegal drug users rather than jailing them. it's a shift that runs deep in public opinion, as well. some two-thirds of americans now typically say that they prefer providing treatment to long prison sentences. ``this is an area where i can get agreement from bernie sanders and mitch mcconnell,'' president obama said at a white house meeting with governors on monday. ``that doesn't happen that often, but this is one. and it indicates the severity of the issue.'' but the governors are, in fact, well ahead of washington on this issue--as they were on welfare reform in the 1990s and, more recently, sentencing reform. gov. peter shumlin (d) of vermont, a leader in the pivot from prisons to treatment, says he got into the addiction fight after talking to people in his state. ``i found we were doing almost everything wrong,'' he told a forum on opioid and heroin addiction at the pew charitable trusts in washington on friday. the best hope is to get more people into treatment, he said. and the best time to do that is ``when the blue lights are flashing and the handcuffs are on.'' vermont, like other states in the northeast, is facing severe opioid challenges. in 2014, governor shumlin devoted his annual state of the state address entirely to [[page s1076]] vermont's ``full-blown heroin crisis.'' annual overdose deaths from opioids had nearly doubled since 2004. the number of people seeking treatment for opioid addiction had spiked 770 percent since 2000. what vermont has done and so vermont has taken a hard look at its approach. instead of jail, nonviolent offenders are given the option of going into treatment. they start in one of the state's new central clinics (hubs) and move on to a family doctor, counselor, or therapist closer to home (spokes). vermont law also shields people seeking medical help for an overdose from prosecution for manufacturing or selling drugs, not just for minor crimes. it also was the first state to legalize the sale of naloxone over the counter in pharmacies--a drug aimed at reversing overdoses and saving lives. other states have moved toward treatment instead of incarceration, but vermont has done it on a grander scale, experts say. ``you've seen some elected officials support legalizing marijuana, some want to reform sentencing, some talk about overdoses, but very few have tied all these together in a comprehensive narrative,'' says bill piper, senior director of national affairs for the drug policy alliance in washington. ``vermont's governor is at the forefront, and what makes him unique is that he's one of the few elected officials that has connected the dots on the various issues,'' he adds. as a pioneer state, vermont has also identified some of the limits of a treatment-centric strategy. ``as you build out treatment, and particularly in rural america, we can't get enough docs who are able to meet the demand of our waiting lists,'' shumlin told the president at the white house meeting monday. but the most important issue, he told mr. obama, is to ``come up with a more rational approach to prescribing prescription drugs.'' a bid to rein in prescriptions governors see legal prescriptions for drugs like oxycontin as the gateway to heroin. ``overprescribing of opioid painkillers has fueled the nation's addiction crisis,'' according to a report from the national governors association's health and human services committee. in a bid to rein in prescriptions, governors on that committee plan to develop a list of protocols to present to the full membership at the next nga meeting in august. ``the united states represents 5 percent of the world's population and consumes 80 percent of the world's opioids,'' said gov. charlie baker (r) of massachusetts, who chairs the nga's health and human services committee, on saturday. that's ``fundamentally flawed.'' when prescriptions are too hard to get--or too expensive-- addicts switch to heroin. ``most of the heroin addicts we treat started by using prescription opiates,'' says brian mcalister, author of ``full recovery'' and ceo of the full recovery wellness center in fairfield, n.j. ``some were prescribed by a doctor or dentist, others were stolen from family or friends' medicine cabinets, and others were purchased illegally just to party--but the party ends very quickly. these drugs are highly addictive, and when the supply runs out, the problems get worse.'' at the national level the prospect of politicians reining in pharmaceutical sales is a stretch in the halls of congress. in 1993, the gop- controlled congress explicitly barred government from negotiating lower drug prices with drug companies. last year, big pharma spent more than $235 million to influence policy outcomes in washington--the largest budget of any lobby group in washington. governors could set protocols on prescribing practices for painkillers on their own, shumlin told the president. ``but it takes time,'' and ``it doesn't apply to all 50 states.'' instead, he asked obama to ``consider a national approach which simply says, for minor procedures, we're going to limit this to 10 pills and after that you've got to come back for more.'' ``to be candid, the docs, the ama [american medical association] are resistant to listening to politicians like us talking about how many pills to prescribe. but is there something you could do on a national level that would help us get out of this tragic mess?'' he added. obama answered, at length, but in the end deferred to the states. ``a very specific approach to working with the docs, the hospitals, the providers so that they are not overprescribing'' can be done at the national level, he said. ``but it is most profitably done, i think, if we have bipartisan support from the governors so that by the time it gets to the national level, there is consensus and there's not a lot of politics involved in it.'' in a recent blog, ama president steven stack called the opioid epidemic a ``defining moment'' for the profession. ``our nation is needlessly losing thousands of people to a preventable epidemic, and we must take action for our patients.'' mr. leahy. i see nobody else seeking recognition, so i suggest the absence of a quorum, and i ask the time be equally divided. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. johnson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. cloture motion the presiding officer. pursuant to rule xxii, the chair lays before the senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. the legislative clerk read as follows: cloture

motion is agreed to. the senator from iowa. mr. grassley. mr. president, an historic epidemic of drug overdose deaths is gripping our country. over 47,000 americans died from overdoses in 2014, an alltime high. incredibly, that is more deaths than resulted from either car crashes or gun violence. addiction to opioids, primarily prescription pain killers and heroin, is driving this epidemic. it is destroying lives, families, and communities. it is a crisis. and it demands action. [[page s1077]] thankfully, the senate can act this week, when we consider s. 524, the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, or cara. cara is a bipartisan bill authored by two democrats and two republicans--senators whitehouse, portman, klobuchar, and ayotte. these senators have shown extraordinary leadership on this issue. they deserve credit for crafting a bill that addresses many of the different aspects of this epidemic, through evidence-based solutions and best practices. this is a complex crisis that requires a multifaceted solution. over the past few months, i have worked hard with the bill's authors to refine it and move it through the judiciary committee. i am proud to say that a few weeks ago it passed the committee on a voice vote, with no opposition. cara is only the latest bipartisan legislative accomplishment by the judiciary committee this congress. we have had 21 bills pass the committee this congress, all with bipartisan support. but there are a few major bills that stand out. last april, the committee passed the justice for victims of trafficking act unanimously, 19-0. the bill enhances penalties for human trafficking and equips law enforcement with new tools to target predators who traffic innocent young people. the bill passed the senate 99-0 and was signed into law by the president. in october, the committee passed the landmark sentencing reform and corrections act with a strong 15-5 bipartisan vote. my bill would recalibrate prison sentences for certain drug offenders, target violent criminals, and grant judges greater discretion at sentencing for lower- level drug crimes. i am working hard to build additional support for the bill so that it can be taken up by the full senate soon. then in december, the committee passed my juvenile justice and delinquency prevention reauthorization act, again without opposition. the bill will ensure that at-risk youth are fairly and effectively served by juvenile justice grant programs. again, we are working hard to move this bill through the full senate. the bipartisan reforms enacted by each of these bills address real problems that affect the lives of many people across the nation and in my home state of iowa. i am proud of the work we have done so far--but there is a lot more to do. and that brings me back to the heroin and prescription drug epidemic. it isn't as bad in iowa as it is in many areas of the country, but the eastern part of my state has been hit hard recently. the human cost of what is happening across so many of these communities is incalculable. every life that is lost or changed forever by this epidemic is precious. especially for many young people who fall victim to addiction early in their lives, there is so much human potential at stake. many iowans have heard the story of kim brown, a nurse from davenport, and her son andy. andy was prescribed pain pills when he had surgery at age 14. whether it was connected to abuse of those pain pills or not, he developed a drug problem as a teenager that he couldn't shake. he overdosed on heroin a few times but survived. and finally, at age 33, he died of an overdose, tragically leaving behind two young sons. ms. brown now speaks out around the state about the heroin epidemic. her story reflects a larger pattern. over the last 20 years or so, doctors have increasingly prescribed opioids to help their patients manage pain. for many, these medicines have been the answer to their prayers. but for others, they have led to a nightmare of addiction. according to numerous studies, prescription opioid addiction is a strong risk factor for heroin addiction. in some cases, those addicted to painkillers turn to heroin to get a similar high, because recently, it has become cheaper and more easily available. and as ms. brown's story reflects, this epidemic is a matter of life and death. in fact, nationally, heroin overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014. but iowans are fighting back. last year, with the assistance of a new federal grant, the u.s. attorney's office and the cedar rapids police department formed the eastern iowa heroin initiative. this partnership is focused on stemming the tide of heroin abuse through enforcement, prevention and treatment. i have been invited to participate in a townhall with them to discuss the epidemic, and i plan to do so soon. when i do, i want to tell them that the senate has acted on this crisis by passing cara. cara supports so many of the efforts to help stem the tide of addiction that are underway in iowa and across the country. as its name reflects, the bill addresses the epidemic comprehensively, supporting prevention, education, treatment, recovery, and law enforcement. cara starts with prevention and education. it authorizes awareness and education campaigns, so that the public understands the dangers of becoming addicted to prescription painkillers. it creates a national task force to develop best prescribing practices, so that doctors don't expose their patients to unnecessary risks of addiction. the bill encourages the use of prescription drug monitoring programs like iowa's, which helps detect and deter ``doctor shopping'' behavior by addicts. and the bill authorizes an expansion of the federal initiative that allows patients to safely dispose of old or unused medications, so that these drugs don't fall into the hands of young people, potentially leading to addiction. in fact, along with a few other committee members, i helped start this ``take back'' program in 2010 through the secure and responsible drug disposal act. it has been a highly successful effort. since 2010, over 2,700 tons of drugs have been collected from medicine cabinets and disposed of safely. iowa also has a similar ``take back'' program that's expanding rapidly. cara also focuses on treatment and recovery. the bill authorizes programs to provide first responders with training to use naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and directly save lives. naloxone was used hundreds of times by first responders in iowa in 2014. importantly, the bill provides that a set portion of naloxone funding go to rural areas, like much of iowa that is being affected most acutely. this is critical when someone overdoses and isn't near a hospital. the bill also authorizes an expansion of drug free communities act grants to those areas that are most dramatically affected by the opioid epidemic. and it also authorizes funds for programs that encourage the use of medication assisted treatment, provide community-based support for those in recovery, and address the unique needs of pregnant and postpartum women who are addicted to opioids. finally, the bill also bolsters law enforcement efforts as well. amazingly, in 2007, only 8 percent of state and local law enforcement officials across the country identified heroin as the greatest drug threat in their area. but by 2015, that number rose to 38 percent, more than any other drug. so the bill reauthorizes federal funding for state task forces that specifically address heroin trafficking. i am also pleased that i was able to include in the bill a reauthorization of the funding for the methamphetamine law enforcement task forces as well. i held a judiciary committee field hearing in des moines last fall about the ongoing meth problem across iowa. and one thing the hearing made clear is that our friends in state law enforcement need all the help we can give them on that front, too. all in all, the bill authorizes about $78 million per year to address this crisis. it is no wonder that the bill is supported by a diverse range of stakeholders, including the community anti-drug coalitions of america, the partnership for drug-free kids, the national district attorneys association, the major county sheriffs' association, the national association of attorneys general, and so many organizations in the treatment and recovery communities. i urge my colleagues to support it this week, when the senate has the opportunity to act to address this epidemic. we owe it to those, like kim brown, who have lost sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, coworkers and friends to act now. [[page s1078]] i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from ohio. mr. portman. mr. president, first i thank my colleague and chairman of the judiciary committee, chuck grassley. many years ago i went to iowa with senator grassley to set up an anti-drug coalition. we had done one in ohio. i was the chair of that, and chuck grassley asked if i would come. this was probably 20 years ago that senator grassley--and i was in the house. we had a great visit. we had a couple of townhall meetings. chuck grassley is a guy who understands the issue, cares about it, and has devoted a lot of time and resources to it in iowa. the people of iowa know he is sincere about it because he has been on the ground setting up these coalitions and dealing with this issue. frankly, it is a little disappointing--probably to him and to me--to see that some 20 years later we are still facing this issue now and even different issues. he mentioned methamphetamines. he mentioned, of course, the heroin and opiate addiction problems with prescription drugs. twenty years ago it was more marijuana and cocaine, but i think the lesson we have all learned is these drugs will come and go in terms of their severity and their impact on our communities and our families, but it is always going to be there, and we need to keep up the fight. right now we have an urgent problem. that urgent problem was outlined by senator grassley, but it is this growing use of opiates that leads to a horrible addiction. it has a grip on so many of our constituents, so many of our loved ones. over the weekend i had a townhall meeting. i asked--after we had talked about taxes, trade, energy, and other issues--if people would just raise their hands if they had been affected by the heroin and prescription drug addiction problem. i said: has anybody in your family and friends been affected? half of the hands in the room went up. unfortunately, that is the reality of this situation. in ohio last year we lost almost 2,400 just to overdose deaths. that doesn't account for the fact that so many people are being saved now by naloxone--which is something that is encouraged by our legislation and we will talk about it in a second. narcan is being used, but even those who survive the overdoses, of course, are seeing their families broken apart, their communities devastated. i talked to a prosecutor over the weekend in one of our more rural counties, and he said: rob, over 80 percent of our crime is directly related to this issue now, heroin and prescription drugs. often it is people committing crimes to pay for their habit. the people who are the purveyors of these drugs have a business plan; that is, to get you hooked with a relatively low cost at first and then you need more and more to be able to feel the same high. it gets more expensive to the point that it might go from $50 to $100 the first time to $1,000 or $1,500 a day by the end of your addiction. this is how horrible it is and it leads to so many collateral consequences. i am very pleased the senate voted tonight to proceed to this legislation called cara, the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. cara is a federal response to this issue. it is attempting to make the federal government a better partner with state and local governments, with nonprofits, to be able to help to reverse this tide to deal with this urgent problem in our communities. i would call it an epidemic. it certainly is at epidemic levels in my state of ohio. sadly, we are the top five in the country in terms of overdose deaths, but again it goes well beyond just those deaths. there are so many people who are affected by it negatively and so many who have not been able to fulfill their god-given purpose because of this horrible addiction. this legislation called cara is bipartisan. it is comprehensive. as senator grassley said, he got it through the judiciary committee. i appreciate that. he got it through with something very extraordinary around here, which is a unanimous vote--meaning nobody objected. that never happens around here. it just means that every senator is addressing this issue back home, understands it, and wants to do something about it. this legislation is built on common sense, research, and experts from around the country who have come in. i thank senator sheldon whitehouse, who is the lead democrat on this legislation and my lead cosponsor. he and i are the coauthors of this legislation. i also thank senators kelly ayotte and amy klobuchar, who have been terrific partners. then there are 34 other bipartisan cosponsors. i thank them all for their support. i am excited that if this bill can pass, it will pass in the house as well because there is companion legislation. in fact, the house bill has 88 cosponsors right now--also bipartisan. so the idea is to get this bill passed, get it through the house, and have it signed into law by the president of the united states. it is urgent we do it. this is a bill that not only has a lot of support on both sides of the aisle, but--much more importantly to me--it has the support of people all over the country who are experts in this field: doctors; those in recovery; experts in prevention, treatment, and recovery; and law enforcement. the legislation actually comes--i hope you can see on this chart, the words are kind of small--but it comes from the last few years, putting together these experts from all around the country. we had five different summit meetings in washington, dc. one was with the criminal justice system. we brought in experts from all around the country to talk about treatment and alternatives to incarceration. as you will see in this legislation, we have ways to divert people from incarceration into treatment programs, which we think is part of the way to solve this problem. we then had one that focused on women, the special interests and needs of women who are facing addiction and how to ensure they get into treatment. as we will talk about later, this has a lot to do with one of the problems that is out there right now, which is more and more babies who are born with addiction and having to take those babies through withdrawal. the care and compassion involved in that is truly impressive, but that was a good forum for us. we had one on the science of addiction and addressing the consequences of addiction. there are a lot of good people around the country who understand the science of this and what medication might work and what future medication might be better to deal with it. we talked about youth drug prevention and developing communities of recovery. this is a very important aspect of our legislation. we don't just talk about treatment, as important as that is, we talked about how you divert people from getting into it in the first place through better prevention and education. finally, we had a forum on veterans focusing on substance abuse and ptsd and other issues. i recently visited one of our veterans courts in columbus, oh, and saw the good work they are doing. most people going through that court have mental health issues. most also now have, sadly, opioid addiction issues, usually starting with prescription drugs and moving to heroin. as i said, there is strong bipartisan support for this legislation in the house and the senate. it is endorsed by more than 130 groups nationwide. by the way, those groups include some groups you might not expect normally to be together on something such as this--the fraternal order of police, the american society of addiction medicine, the faces and voices of recovery, the coalition for a drug free america, the children's hospital association, the national association of addiction treatment providers, the partnership for drug free kids, the american society of addiction medicine, the national association of state alcohol and drug abuse directors, groups who are in all of our states, the national council for behavioral health, and, of course, the major county sheriffs' association. so law enforcement, treatment, recovery, education--everybody is coming together on this because we realize this is going to take that kind of comprehensive approach with all sectors of our community being involved and engaged. cara now has support not only of a lot of these groups from around the country, but because of these groups--they helped us write a better bill. [[page s1079]] what does the bill do? here are the basic elements of cara: first, with regard to prevention and education, it does establish new task forces to develop better practices for prescribers simply because there has been overprescribing, particularly of prescription drugs. these narcotics have been overprescribed to the point that many people end up on heroin as a less expensive alternative to the prescription drugs to which they have become addicted. the task force is an interagency task force that is reporting back to the congress on how to develop these best practices for the medical community. the bill also establishes a national awareness campaign with regard to prevention and education. that is critical for us to get the word out. it has grants to local coalitions. this is in the drug-free communities act area. the drug-free communities act goes back to the 1990s. since 1998 there has been $1.3 billion spent under the drug-free communities act. i was the author of that in the house. it is good legislation that helped create over 2,000 community coalitions around america. i chaired ours in cincinnati, oh, for 9 years and am still very involved with it, and they do great work. but, again, we now have this new issue, this new threat we must address. this helps with regard to specific grants where there is a high degree of opioid addiction and the negative consequences of it, to be able to blend with the drug-free community program. law enforcement. the bill provides for training for narcan--what is known as naloxone--for first responders to prevent overdoses. i think everybody in this chamber has run into this back home. i went to a firehouse recently because we had lost a brave firefighter in a house fire, and i went to talk to his shift about him and to thank them for their service. after talking to them about their fallen comrade, they wanted to talk about this issue. they told me: rob, we are spending more time administering narcan than we are fighting fires these days. in other words, they are going out and helping people who are having overdoses and are saving their lives. a friend of mine who is a firefighter in cincinnati told me just a couple of weeks ago that he was responding to an overdose, saving someone in front of a house, when, in an entirely different group in the back of the house, an overdose occurred. in toledo last week, there was a response by emergency medical services to somebody who had hit a telephone pole. they found him with a syringe in his arm. he had overdosed. while they were responding to him, there were two other overdose calls in toledo--one city in ohio. there were three at the same time. two of the three were saved by narcan. the third died. our folks in law enforcement and our first responders, our firefighters, are doing a terrific job. they need help. they need more narcan and more training to be sure they can continue to do what they are doing to prevent these overdoses. it is not the answer. of course, the answer is prevention, education, and better treatment. but in the meantime, we have to provide them the help they need. the law enforcement side also expands these drug prescription take- back programs. they work very well, as senator grassley said, in some of our states. we need to do more to expand those, and that is usually done through our law enforcement communities. it also authorizes a task force to combat heroin and methamphetamines. these are the law enforcement task forces we talked about earlier, which will help to coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement to deal with this issue. on the treatment and recovery side, it expands medication assisted treatment for opioid and heroin addiction. it creates diversion, education, and treatment programs in the criminal justice system. we talked about that earlier. that is so important. i have been at roundtable discussions all around my state and at a number of treatment centers talking to recovering addicts about how they got into the situation they are in and what advice they have. a young man told me a classic story. he had an injury. he started using prescription drugs. he got addicted. he needed money to buy these expensive pain pills. he actually stole from a family member, and he ended up in the law enforcement system and in jail. it was in jail that he was told for the first time that it was actually cheaper to buy heroin. he got out and bought heroin and became a heroin addict. he is now in treatment. he hit rock bottom, as he said, and i think it was because he had an overdose. this is something where we need to figure out a better way to get people diverted and use the criminal justice system to provide the incentive to get them into the right treatment program. it also supports recovery for youth and building communities of recovery, again focusing on our youth to get them to make the right decisions but also steering our youth who are addicted into the recovery they need. sadly, this is now necessary in many of our high schools and in our colleges and universities. it also establishes a task force to review some of the recovery and collateral consequences. this is an interagency task force that is going to report back to us on what is truly working and what is not working in order to do a deeper dive to ensure we are using this money most effectively in order to make a difference. it has treatment services for women and veterans included. this is a special interest of ours in this legislation--expanding treatment for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction, again to avoid this horrible situation where babies are born with an addiction. it also supports care for our veterans. our veterans right now can enter treatment, of course, following discharge with this legislation. this is important. our veterans have some special needs and special circumstances--often trauma, ptsd, and other things related to their addiction. we find these veterans courts are incredibly helpful, to be able to have them surrounded by fellow veterans in order to make more progress. that is in here as well. finally, the legislation incentivizes the states themselves to enact comprehensive initiatives to address the opioid and heroin abuse problem--the prescription drug monitoring program, for instance. this is very important. the federal government has a big role to play here. think about it. if you are in one state and you are monitoring someone's prescription drug medications, knowing where they are going and how much they are getting to avoid overprescribing, if that person crosses state lines, it is very difficult. so our legislation expands on what can be done there to ensure that, for instance, my state of ohio knows whether someone has gone to kentucky, west virginia, pennsylvania, indiana, or michigan to get prescription drugs. so the prescription drug monitoring program will work better for every state. prevention and education on heroin abuses--this is to incentivize states to do a better job on the prevention and education side and, of course, to prevent overdose and to improve drug treatment. these are all aspects of this legislation. it is comprehensive because the problem is complex and requires a comprehensive approach. here are some statistics--we have already talked about some this evening--that are shocking. we know that 28,647 americans died in the last year for which we had data, which is 2014, from a drug overdose. the 2015 numbers will be higher than that. that is roughly 120 americans dying every day. there were 27,000 diagnosed cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 2013, the last numbers we have. it is even worse this year. this means babies were born with an addiction. a baby is born dependent on opioids every 19 minutes in america. so while i am speaking today, there will be another baby born who is addicted. i have gone to hospitals in cincinnati; in lima, oh, to st. rita's; to rainbow babies children's hospital in cleveland, oh. they are incredible caregivers. my wife jane was at nationwide children's hospital today, actually, on this very issue. these are babies who are so tiny, you can almost hold them in the palm of your hand. they need caregivers to take them through a process where they go through withdrawal. and we are not [[page s1080]] sure what the long-term consequences are because we don't have the data yet because this is such a new issue. there has been a substantial increase over the last several years. in ohio, the same thing i said earlier--750 percent increase in the number of babies diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome since 2004. there has been a 750-percent increase in babies born addicted. these are the issues this legislation gets at. again, it does so in a way that is not just bipartisan, which is important, and not just house and senate, which is important--the house has its own companion bill, one the president will be able to sign into law--but most importantly, it is because of the input of people from all over this country, the experts, people who are recovering themselves, and those who are most affected by this, that this legislation makes sense, and not just for my state but for our country. the judiciary committee had a number of good witnesses. one was a woman named tonda dare. tonda dare is from ohio. she had a daughter named holly. on her 21st birthday, holly, who had a bright future ahead of her--she was engaged to be married, and she had been very involved in her high school and active in sports--tried heroin for the first time. she became addicted. she went into recovery, and unfortunately, as in many cases, she had a relapse. at age 23 her young life ended in an overdose. her mom, tonda dare, set up an organization called holly's song of hope. she testified before the judiciary committee about the importance of her work--talking to other mothers and fathers and sons and daughters about the devastating consequences of this heroin and prescription drug addiction. this legislation needs to be passed so that we can help tonda. she testified on behalf of this legislation because she has looked at it and knows it will make a difference in her life and her community. this is an urgent problem, as i said earlier. it is also one we have a lot of bipartisan consensus around. there will be opportunities during this debate to hear from a lot of different people on a lot of different ideas on amendments to the legislation. that is good. it is good to have a debate. but i hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will keep focused on the importance of getting this done. it is important to get it done in terms of providing immediate help to our communities and also providing a structure to more effectively spend funds this year--and yes, we have funds to spend this year that have been appropriated consistent with cara--but also next year and the year after and the year after. some will support more resources, and that is fine. we need to have that debate. i myself think it is a priority, and we should be providing the resources to be able to deal with this issue. i would also urge my colleagues to ensure that we get this over the finish line. it is too important. we can't play politics with it. this is one of those issues, again, like so few around here, that got out of the committee without a single dissenting vote. we have done the right thing on a bipartisan basis to bring in the experts. we have a good solution to an urgent problem we all face. i am pleased with the vote tonight, and i urge my colleagues to have a good debate on the floor. let's get this done for the sake of tonda dare and so many other mothers, fathers, and others out there who deserve to have a little help in their fight against opioid addiction. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senate majority leader. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i just want to congratulate the senator from ohio for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. this is an epidemic that affects us all, and he has definitely been at the fore in providing exceptional leadership on this, and i want to commend him for that. ____________________",48832

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1081-3,CREC-2016-02-29,114,ANNIVERSARY OF PROTESTS IN BAHRAIN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1081-S1082] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ANNIVERSARY OF PROTESTS IN BAHRAIN Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this month marks 5 years since Bahrainis of all backgrounds took to the streets in Manama in peaceful protest, calling for reform in their country. As Senators have heard me recount here before, the Government of Bahrain responded with violence and repression, torture and retaliation. In response, the monarchy set up an independent commission: the so-called Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, or BICI. And I say this is important to recall because many of the BICI's 26 specific, concrete recommendations remain unfulfilled 5 years later. That certainly isn't what the government of Bahrain wants you to believe. In fact, the regime's representatives continue to insist that they have fully implemented all of the BICI recommendations. As they tell it, they have turned the page on that chapter of Bahrain's history. But members of Bahrain's peaceful opposition feel trapped in a never- ending story. Nongovernmental organizations like Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain, Amnesty International, Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, and the Project on Middle East Democracy have all documented the regime's ongoing repression. The State Department's most recent annual human rights report for Bahrain states that protestors face ``arbitrary deprivation of life,'' ``arrest and detention of protesters . . . occasionally leading to their torture,'' and ``restrictions on civil liberties, including freedom of speech, press, assembly association, and religion.'' And as some colleagues know, the State Department could last [[Page S1082]] certify that Bahrain had only fully implemented 5 of the 26 BICI recommendations. That is a pretty far cry from full implementation. As the son of a journalist, I want to take a minute to highlight one particular aspect of the regime's repression: the crackdown on speech and expression. As recently as this month, a Bahraini court sentenced an internationally known photographer to serve jail time for participating in an unlicensed protest. The regime has similarly targeted bloggers as well as prominent and award-winning photojournalists for merely capturing Bahrain's ongoing unrest. And just this month, a Bahraini court sentenced a Sunni opposition leader to 1 year in prison for giving a political speech. Despite these concerns, the Obama administration chose last year to resume selling or transferring certain arms to the Government of Bahrain. I was one of the biggest proponents of the arms ban dating back to 2011, and I saw no reason to revisit the policy last year. In fact, I introduced the bipartisan BICI Accountability Act, legislation that would block the administration's decision to overturn the weapons ban until the State Department could certify that all 26 BICI recommendations were fully implemented. I am not here to make broad pronouncements about what the Government of Bahrain should look like--that is very much a conversation for Bahrain's people and its rulers to have. But as President Obama said in 2011, ``you can't have a real dialogue when parts of the peaceful opposition are in jail.'' For Bahrain to move forward, the government will need to release the opposition leaders still languishing in its prisons. The United States and Bahrain have ties that go back decades; our countries are partners and allies. Indeed, I am not disappointed with the Government of Bahrain despite our bilateral relationship; I am disappointed with the Government of Bahrain because of our bilateral relationship. The United States of America has an obligation, it strikes me, to ask more of her friends and allies around the world. And when they falter or fail, the U.S. has a duty to help them live up to their potential. And of course, there is always the real danger that continued unrest or even greater instability could impact the safety of our soldiers in Bahrain or the future of the American presence there. For these reasons, I speak out today against further oppression, and I call again for reconciliation and reform in Bahrain. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1081-S1082] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ANNIVERSARY OF PROTESTS IN BAHRAIN Mr. WYDEN.

The United States of America has an obligation, it strikes me, to ask more of her friends and allies around the world. And when they falter or fail, the U.S. has a duty to help them live up to their potential. And of course, there is always the real danger that continued unrest or even greater instability could impact the safety of our soldiers in Bahrain or the future of the American presence there. For these reasons, I speak out today against further oppression, and I call again for reconciliation and reform in Bahrain. ____________________",package_114_148.csv,4307,4307,4377,"[congressional record volume 162, number 32 (monday, february 29, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1081-s1082] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] anniversary of protests in bahrain mr. wyden. mr. president, this month marks 5 years since bahrainis of all backgrounds took to the streets in manama in peaceful protest, calling for reform in their country. as senators have heard me recount here before, the government of bahrain responded with violence and repression, torture and retaliation. in response, the monarchy set up an independent commission: the so-called bahrain independent commission of inquiry, or bici. and i say this is important to recall because many of the bici's 26 specific, concrete recommendations remain unfulfilled 5 years later. that certainly isn't what the government of bahrain wants you to believe. in fact, the regime's representatives continue to insist that they have fully implemented all of the bici recommendations. as they tell it, they have turned the page on that chapter of bahrain's history. but members of bahrain's peaceful opposition feel trapped in a never- ending story. nongovernmental organizations like americans for democracy and human rights in bahrain, amnesty international, human rights first, human rights watch, and the project on middle east democracy have all documented the regime's ongoing repression. the state department's most recent annual human rights report for bahrain states that protestors face ``arbitrary deprivation of life,'' ``arrest and detention of protesters . . . occasionally leading to their torture,'' and ``restrictions on civil liberties, including freedom of speech, press, assembly association, and religion.'' and as some colleagues know, the state department could last [[page s1082]] certify that bahrain had only fully implemented 5 of the 26 bici recommendations. that is a pretty far cry from full implementation. as the son of a journalist, i want to take a minute to highlight one particular aspect of the regime's repression: the crackdown on speech and expression. as recently as this month, a bahraini court sentenced an internationally known photographer to serve jail time for participating in an unlicensed protest. the regime has similarly targeted bloggers as well as prominent and award-winning photojournalists for merely capturing bahrain's ongoing unrest. and just this month, a bahraini court sentenced a sunni opposition leader to 1 year in prison for giving a political speech. despite these concerns, the obama administration chose last year to resume selling or transferring certain arms to the government of bahrain. i was one of the biggest proponents of the arms ban dating back to 2011, and i saw no reason to revisit the policy last year. in fact, i introduced the bipartisan bici accountability act, legislation that would block the administration's decision to overturn the weapons ban until the state department could certify that all 26 bici recommendations were fully implemented. i am not here to make broad pronouncements about what the government of bahrain should look like--that is very much a conversation for bahrain's people and its rulers to have. but as president obama said in 2011, ``you can't have a real dialogue when parts of the peaceful opposition are in jail.'' for bahrain to move forward, the government will need to release the opposition leaders still languishing in its prisons. the united states and bahrain have ties that go back decades; our countries are partners and allies. indeed, i am not disappointed with the government of bahrain despite our bilateral relationship; i am disappointed with the government of bahrain because of our bilateral relationship. the united states of america has an obligation, it strikes me, to ask more of her friends and allies around the world. and when they falter or fail, the u.s. has a duty to help them live up to their potential. and of course, there is always the real danger that continued unrest or even greater instability could impact the safety of our soldiers in bahrain or the future of the american presence there. for these reasons, i speak out today against further oppression, and i call again for reconciliation and reform in bahrain. ____________________",4307
CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1080,CREC-2016-02-29,114,MORNING BUSINESS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1080-S1081] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MORNING BUSINESS ______ BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND THE PULLMAN PORTERS Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this year marks the 90th anniversary of historian and scholar Dr. Carter G. Woodson's launch of Negro History Week--and is the 40th anniversary of the inaugural Black History Month. This year, as Black History Month is coming to a close, I want to celebrate by paying tribute to a Chicago neighborhood that has played a significant part in our country's African-American and labor history-- the Pullman Historical District. One year ago this month, President Obama designated the South Side Chicago's Pullman Historic District as the Nation's 406th national park. The Pullman National Historical Park has a special place in our Nation's history. It has been the site of some major historical events. The men and women of the Pullman community--the birthplace of the Nation's first Black labor union--the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters--helped shape our country as we know it today. By fighting for fair labor conditions in the 19th century, the Pullman workers advanced America's civil rights movement. In the 1890s, the Pullman community was the catalyst for the first industrywide strike during one of the worst economic depressions our Nation ever faced--and led to the creation of Labor Day as a national holiday. These railroad workers aren't always mentioned in the history books or picked to join the parades during Black History Month--but they made history and deserve to be honored. One hundred and one years ago, fearing that the history of African Americans was fading into obscurity, Dr. Carter G. Woodson founded the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History. His goal was to raise awareness of African Americans' contributions to civilization. He believed that truth could not be denied--and realized that past contributions by African Americans needed to be documented and taught. He once said, ``if a race had no recorded history, its achievements would be forgotten and, in time, claimed by other groups.'' I agree with Dr. Woodson--and so does the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum in Chicago. Earlier this month, with the help of DePaul University, the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum launched a new online registry that gives voice to the stories of Black railroad workers. By capturing stories from scholars and the relatives of these workers, we will preserve oral histories that otherwise might be lost to history. If you listen to the oral histories, you will hear stories from people like Theodore Berrien, who worked as a Pullman porter from 1940 to 1969. Berrien worked on President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's funeral train from Georgia to Washington, DC. On the registry, Berrien's grandson says: ``He spoke of how kind Mrs. Roosevelt was and thanked him for his services during the trip.'' Or take Blaine McKinley Fitzgerald, who worked as a Pullman porter on the Illinois Central and Louisville and Nashville railroads from 1920 to 1946--his relatives wrote: ``Blaine's major route was from Birmingham to New York. He also worked the Rose Bowl trips to California when Alabama was a major contingent.'' You will hear how Blaine raised a family of six children on his salary as a Pullman porter--all college educated--who became teachers, lawyers, and engineers. Blaine's story is just one of many examples of how the Pullman porters helped build the African-American middle class in Chicago. But even as the African-American middle class expanded in Chicago and across the country, the struggle for justice, equality, and equal opportunities for African Americans in this country has continued. And the State of Illinois has played a significant role in that struggle. Springfield, IL native President Abraham Lincoln led our Nation through a war to save the Union, abolished slavery, and began the work we continue today to end discrimination. In 1909, the centennial of Lincoln's birth, 2,000 people gathered at a dazzling gala to honor the centennial of Lincoln's birth. Even though this was an event celebrating the centennial of the President that helped abolish slavery--like most in America at that time, it was segregated. The Chicago Tribune reported, that it ``is to be a lily white affair from start to finish.'' But across town, the Black community organized its own Lincoln centennial at the African [[Page S1081]] Methodist Episcopal Church. The Reverend L.H. Magee spoke at that gathering and noted the widespread feeling of hurt over the exclusion of people of color from the main Lincoln banquet. Reverend Magee made a prediction about the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth in 2009--100 years in the future: ``prejudice shall have been banished as a myth and relegated to the dark days of Salem witchcraft.'' In many ways, his prediction was correct. We have come a long way to banish discrimination in our communities--our legal system recognizes that all men and women are created equal and should be free from discrimination in schools, housing, and employment. And in 2009, President Barack Obama, a former Illinois Senator, was sworn in as the first African-American President of the United States of America. Pastor Magee had a vision of a new America, but he may not have imagined that bricks laid by the hands of slaves would make a home in our White House for a family of color. But, while progress has been made, we cannot ignore that we still have more to do. When one in three African-American men will go to prison in their lifetime, we have more to do. When the unemployment rate for African Americans are more than double the rate for Whites, we have more to do. And when efforts exist across the country to make it harder to vote, rather than easier, we have more to do. But it is when the climb is the steepest that we can come together as Americans, to take the mountaintop once and for all. This month, let's celebrate these achievements and honor Dr. Carter G. Woodson's legacy by remembering all the contributions of the extraordinary men and women of the civil rights movement--including the Pullman porters. We have come a long way, but we still have work to do to fulfill the promise to make our Nation fairer and more equal and to do what Lincoln called on us to do: ``nobly save . . . the last best hope of earth.''

Jordan is a key partner in the coalition working together to defeat Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (ISIL) forces. This engine and sustainment program will maintain Jordan's fighter aircraft capabilities and support its national defense. Jordan will have no difficulty absorbing this support. The proposed sale of this equipment, services, and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. Jordan has accounted for the cost of engine sustainment in its budget over the course of multiple years. The prime contractor will be Pratt and Whitney, East Hartford, Connecticut.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the tragic deaths of two fellow Marylanders. Senior Deputy Patrick Dailey and Senior Deputy Mark Logsdon of the Harford County Sheriff's Office were killed in the line of duty on February 10. I join the people of Maryland and law enforcement communities across the country in mourning the loss of two dedicated public servants. The men and women of law enforcement put themselves at great risk to protect our communities. Law enforcement officers are the embodiment of the rule of law. An attack on them is an attack on the rule of law itself. The word ``hero'' does not do justice to the legacies of Senior Deputies Dailey and Logsdon. Both men served the people of Harford County with distinction. On his 16th birthday, Deputy Patrick Dailey began his career in public service by joining the Joppa-Magnolia Volunteer Fire Company. His two sons, Bryan and Tyler, are also members of Joppa-Magnolia Volunteer Fire Company. Deputy Dailey was a member of the U.S. Marine Corps before joining the Harford County Sheriff's Office where he would serve for 30 years. On Christmas Eve 2002, Deputy Dailey saved the life of a teenager traveling in an SUV that collided head on with a cement mixing truck. Deputy Dailey, a number of fellow sheriffs, and two civilians emptied six fire extinguishers in an attempt to quell a fire that threated to engulf the vehicle and the unresponsive driver. Using only their bare hands and batons, the group managed to free the driver seconds before the fire consumed the passenger compartment. The teen was able to thank his rescuers 3 months later at the Harford County Sheriff's Office awards banquet. Deputy Logsdon also served in the military before becoming a Harford County Sheriff. He was a member of the 115th Military Police Battalion and deployed to Iraq in 2003 with the Maryland National Guard. Exactly 11 years before his death, Deputy Logsdon confronted a suicidal man who was armed with a loaded shotgun. In a display of great bravery and at great risk to himself, Deputy Logsdon managed to talk the man into surrendering his weapon. After the man was disarmed, Deputy Logsdon continued to help the man by transporting him to the hospital where he received medical care. The deaths of Deputy Dailey and Deputy Logsdon represent a profound loss for the people of Maryland. In the days since the February 10 shooting, Marylanders across the State have responded with a groundswell of support for the Dailey and Logsdon families, as well as the Harford County Sheriff's office. I think that speaks to the character of Marylanders and the esteem in which law enforcement officers are held. I would like to offer my most sincere thanks to other deputies who responded to the call, the Abingdon and Joppa Magnolia Volunteer Fire Departments, the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, and University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, all of whom administered aide to both deputies. On behalf of my fellow U.S. Senators, I offer my deepest condolences to the Dailey and Logsdon families as they navigate this difficult time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1082] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SENIOR DEPUTY PATRICK DAILEY AND SENIOR DEPUTY MARK LOGSDON Mr. CARDIN.

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1082-2,CREC-2016-02-29,114,BLACK HISTORY MONTH,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1082-S1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BLACK HISTORY MONTH Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have every year since I came to the Senate, in commemoration of Black History Month, to recognize an individual who has made a considerable contribution to society and the African-American community. Today, we honor the Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr., a trailblazing figure whose public service and private works have touched lives in Pennsylvania and around the country. Dr. Goode was born to tenant farmers in North Carolina, rose to become the first African-American mayor of Philadelphia, and now runs a nationally renowned organization called Amachi that mentors children whose parents have been incarcerated. Wilson Goode's story is a story of faith and perseverance and also provides an appropriate backdrop this Black History Month to talk about some of the barriers standing in the way of young people in this country today. Dr. Goode has dedicated his life after leaving elected public office to Amachi because, in his words, in these communities, ``the children were invisible.'' This ethos--a commitment to serving those whom the Bible calls ``the least of these''--has guided Dr. Goode's life and career since long before he helped organize Amachi. Empowering young people to achieve their potential is personal for Dr. Goode, who had to overcome a series of roadblocks himself growing up in the Jim Crow South. Dr. Goode went to segregated lower schools in Northampton County, NC, and Greensville County, VA, before moving to Philadelphia at the age of 16. He arrived in Philadelphia on the first Monday in January in 1954. That same Monday 30 years later, this sharecroppers' son, who grew up drinking from separate fountains and eating at separate counters, was sworn in as the first African-American mayor of Philadelphia. In the intervening years, Dr. Goode's career proved a testament to all that can go right when young people are allowed a fair chance to succeed based purely, as a great man once said, on the ``content of their character.'' Dr. Goode graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia in 1957 and went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Morgan State University, a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and a doctorate of ministry from Palmer Theological Seminary. He also served as an officer in the U.S. Army for 2 years. Along the way, Wilson Goode helped found the Black Political Forum, a Philadelphia-based group that brought [[Page S1083]] together a coalition of Black community and business leaders to elect African Americans to public office. The forum transformed the political landscape in the city and Dr. Goode's career along with it. Dr. Goode was later chosen as Pennsylvania's first Black member of the Public Utilities Commission. In less than 6 months, he rose to become the first Black chairman of the PUC and soon thereafter was recruited to become the managing director of the city of Philadelphia under Mayor Bill Green in 1980. When Mayor Green did not seek reelection in 1983, Wilson Goode ran, won the election, and was sworn in as the first African-American mayor of Philadelphia on January 2, 1984, exactly 30 years after he first set foot in the city. During his two terms in office, Dr. Goode accomplished a great deal. He worked to transform the city's skyline, helping businesses to grow and create jobs. He helped to level the playing field for minorities to work in city government and minority-run businesses to win government contracts. He created the Mayor's Commission on Literacy, which has now helped over 550,000 Philadelphians get the skills they need to live productive lives. He created the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network, PAGN, and the Mural Arts Program, two pioneering programs to make Philadelphia a nicer place to live and work. And he always looked to help those who needed it most, whether through his consistent advocacy for AIDS support programming or through his tireless efforts to reduce the number of homeless people living on the streets. The latter goal still animates him today--he is the chairman and CEO of Self, Inc., a nonprofit dedicated to serving homeless men and women. Dr. Goode left the mayor's office after two terms in 1992, but his commitment to public service remained. He went on to work as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Education in the Clinton Administration. There, he devoted himself to the task of improving our education system for 7 years until a unique opportunity presented itself. John J. DiIulio, Jr., President Bush's first director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, invited Dr. Goode to lead a mentoring organization that would later be called Amachi. Amachi's model, which is based on DiIulio's research, is quite simple: identify neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by incarceration and seek out children living in those neighborhoods to mentor. Amachi matches one mentor and one child for at least 1 hour, at least once a week, for at least 1 year. The goals are equally simple: it is a success if, after a year, the kids improve their school attendance, their grades, their behavior, and their relationships with the adults in their lives. Part of the reason for Amachi's success is its simplicity. It makes sense. The real power of the Amachi philosophy comes from its inherent recognition of how much young people can achieve with a consistently positive and loving mentoring presence in their lives. And young people growing up in communities impacted by over-incarceration, the invisible children that Dr. Goode takes the time to see, stand to benefit most. Amachi now receives Federal, State, and private funding, but it has modest roots. To find the first mentors, Dr. Goode walked around throughout Philadelphia, neighborhood by neighborhood, to community churches where he would recite neighborhood statistics on incarceration to local pastors. The terrible reality was that one in nine Black children has a parent in prison, compared to 1 in 57 white children-- one in nine. People of faith were interested in mentoring because two out of three families with an incarcerated member are unable to meet their basic needs and since 50 percent of the over 2.5 million children with an incarcerated parent in this country are age 9 or younger. These numbers motivated Wilson Goode to recruit his mentors and to travel to prisons seeking parents whose kids he could help. This is what he means when he says he is ``on a rescue mission.'' Standing in front of these prisoners, his message was simple: ``I am here on behalf of your children.'' And they believed him. He recruited 500 children his first year. Maybe they believed him in part because he could relate to these challenges--his own father was sent to prison when he was a teenager. His mother worked hard to make ends meet while Wilson Goode sought refuge in his church and in God. He found it, and now he works to provide the same refuge to young people in need. Doctor Goode's story perfectly embodies the idea of Amachi. Amachi is a West African word that means: ``who knows but what God has brought us through this child.'' Who knew that Dr. Goode, who grew up without electricity, who saw his father imprisoned in his adolescence, who gazed up at the leadership in his city and saw no one who looked like him, would be elected mayor of one of America's largest cities. ``Who knows but what God has brought us through this child.'' I have often said that every child is born with a light inside them, and it is our obligation to make sure that that light burns as brightly as the full measure of his or her potential. Dr. Goode's work with Amachi is a testament to this idea. But as we commemorate Black History Month, we must acknowledge that reality is unkind to this worthy aspiration for all our children: in this country, nearly half of Black men are arrested by the time they hit their mid-20s, and Black men are six times more likely to be incarcerated than White men, a worse disparity than in the 1960s. This means that the bright shining light of potential for an African- American child is too often extinguished by the darkness of a jail cell. Looking at the system can be abstract and overwhelming--it is hard to see a child's potential from 30,000 feet. So Dr. Goode works on the ground--because he knows we have to break this cycle. Today Amachi- modeled programs have helped over 300,000 children in more than 250 cities nationwide. Maybe this is what Dr. King meant when he talked about ``dangerous unselfishness.'' Dr. Goode is up against an abstract and overwhelming system, but wields from the goodness of his heart the power to disrupt the status quo. Dr. Goode has faith that, in the months and years to come, we will see our criminal justice system reshaped to be fairer and more effective in targeting the people who pose the most danger to society. He has faith that we will make progress in helping those released from prison more easily reintegrate into their communities. But as he often says, ``no entry is the best reentry plan.'' So his work continues. Every day Amachi-trained mentors work to help thousands of children overcome the wide variety of challenges related to having a parent in prison or living in an area with a high rate of incarceration. In addition to the common financial struggles, these kids need help navigating the relationship changes that often take place when a loved one is sent to or returns from prison; or channeling powerful and confusing emotions into constructive activities; or overcoming the stigma that comes with having an incarcerated parent. What began as a local partnership between faith-based organizations has expanded to include volunteer mentors from a variety of sources on a national scale. All of this can be traced to Dr. Goode's deeply held belief that God has a very special interest in how we treat our children and that helping the children who need it most is God's work. His conviction has earned him great acclaim, whether through receiving the Civic Ventures Purpose Prize, the Philadelphia Inquirer's Citizen of the Year Award, or being honored by the White House as a Champion of Change. But I imagine the biggest reward for Dr. Goode is knowing he has created something lasting that will benefit generations to come. There are more than 81,000 children with a parent in prison in Pennsylvania. How many future doctors, lawyers or CEOs, preachers, teachers or Presidents may be among these children? They have infinite potential, and with God in his heart, the Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr., has stood alongside them. On the Senate floor today, we express our profound gratitude for his service on behalf of the children of Philadelphia, our Commonwealth and our country. Thank you.

Mr. President, I rise today, as I have every year since I came to the Senate, in commemoration of Black History Month, to recognize an individual who has made a considerable contribution to society and the African-American community. Today, we honor the Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr., a trailblazing figure whose public service and private works have touched lives in Pennsylvania and around the country. Dr. Goode was born to tenant farmers in North Carolina, rose to become the first African-American mayor of Philadelphia, and now runs a nationally renowned organization called Amachi that mentors children whose parents have been incarcerated. Wilson Goode's story is a story of faith and perseverance and also provides an appropriate backdrop this Black History Month to talk about some of the barriers standing in the way of young people in this country today. Dr. Goode has dedicated his life after leaving elected public office to Amachi because, in his words, in these communities, ``the children were invisible.'' This ethos--a commitment to serving those whom the Bible calls ``the least of these''--has guided Dr. Goode's life and career since long before he helped organize Amachi. Empowering young people to achieve their potential is personal for Dr. Goode, who had to overcome a series of roadblocks himself growing up in the Jim Crow South. Dr. Goode went to segregated lower schools in Northampton County, NC, and Greensville County, VA, before moving to Philadelphia at the age of 16. He arrived in Philadelphia on the first Monday in January in 1954. That same Monday 30 years later, this sharecroppers' son, who grew up drinking from separate fountains and eating at separate counters, was sworn in as the first African-American mayor of Philadelphia. In the intervening years, Dr. Goode's career proved a testament to all that can go right when young people are allowed a fair chance to succeed based purely, as a great man once said, on the ``content of their character.'' Dr. Goode graduated from John Bartram High School in Philadelphia in 1957 and went on to earn a bachelor's degree from Morgan State University, a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and a doctorate of ministry from Palmer Theological Seminary. He also served as an officer in the U.S. Army for 2 years. Along the way, Wilson Goode helped found the Black Political Forum, a Philadelphia-based group that brought [[Page S1083]] together a coalition of Black community and business leaders to elect African Americans to public office. The forum transformed the political landscape in the city and Dr. Goode's career along with it. Dr. Goode was later chosen as Pennsylvania's first Black member of the Public Utilities Commission. In less than 6 months, he rose to become the first Black chairman of the PUC and soon thereafter was recruited to become the managing director of the city of Philadelphia under Mayor Bill Green in 1980. When Mayor Green did not seek reelection in 1983, Wilson Goode ran, won the election, and was sworn in as the first African-American mayor of Philadelphia on January 2, 1984, exactly 30 years after he first set foot in the city. During his two terms in office, Dr. Goode accomplished a great deal. He worked to transform the city's skyline, helping businesses to grow and create jobs. He helped to level the playing field for minorities to work in city government and minority-run businesses to win government contracts. He created the Mayor's Commission on Literacy, which has now helped over 550,000 Philadelphians get the skills they need to live productive lives. He created the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network, PAGN, and the Mural Arts Program, two pioneering programs to make Philadelphia a nicer place to live and work. And he always looked to help those who needed it most, whether through his consistent advocacy for AIDS support programming or through his tireless efforts to reduce the number of homeless people living on the streets. The latter goal still animates him today--he is the chairman and CEO of Self, Inc., a nonprofit dedicated to serving homeless men and women. Dr. Goode left the mayor's office after two terms in 1992, but his commitment to public service remained. He went on to work as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Education in the Clinton Administration. There, he devoted himself to the task of improving our education system for 7 years until a unique opportunity presented itself. John J. DiIulio, Jr., President Bush's first director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, invited Dr. Goode to lead a mentoring organization that would later be called Amachi. Amachi's model, which is based on DiIulio's research, is quite simple: identify neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by incarceration and seek out children living in those neighborhoods to mentor. Amachi matches one mentor and one child for at least 1 hour, at least once a week, for at least 1 year. The goals are equally simple: it is a success if, after a year, the kids improve their school attendance, their grades, their behavior, and their relationships with the adults in their lives. Part of the reason for Amachi's success is its simplicity. It makes sense. The real power of the Amachi philosophy comes from its inherent recognition of how much young people can achieve with a consistently positive and loving mentoring presence in their lives. And young people growing up in communities impacted by over-incarceration, the invisible children that Dr. Goode takes the time to see, stand to benefit most. Amachi now receives Federal, State, and private funding, but it has modest roots. To find the first mentors, Dr. Goode walked around throughout Philadelphia, neighborhood by neighborhood, to community churches where he would recite neighborhood statistics on incarceration to local pastors.

and more effective in targeting the people who pose the most danger to society. he has faith that we will make progress in helping those released from prison more easily reintegrate into their communities. but as he often says, ``no entry is the best reentry plan.'' so his work continues. every day amachi-trained mentors work to help thousands of children overcome the wide variety of challenges related to having a parent in prison or living in an area with a high rate of incarceration. in addition to the common financial struggles, these kids need help navigating the relationship changes that often take place when a loved one is sent to or returns from prison; or channeling powerful and confusing emotions into constructive activities; or overcoming the stigma that comes with having an incarcerated parent. what began as a local partnership between faith-based organizations has expanded to include volunteer mentors from a variety of sources on a national scale. all of this can be traced to dr. goode's deeply held belief that god has a very special interest in how we treat our children and that helping the children who need it most is god's work. his conviction has earned him great acclaim, whether through receiving the civic ventures purpose prize, the philadelphia inquirer's citizen of the year award, or being honored by the white house as a champion of change. but i imagine the biggest reward for dr. goode is knowing he has created something lasting that will benefit generations to come. there are more than 81,000 children with a parent in prison in pennsylvania. how many future doctors, lawyers or ceos, preachers, teachers or presidents may be among these children? they have infinite potential, and with god in his heart, the reverend dr. w. wilson goode, sr., has stood alongside them. on the senate floor today, we express our profound gratitude for his service on behalf of the children of philadelphia, our commonwealth and our country. thank you.

Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me in honoring the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, or NCIS, as it celebrates 50 years of service in support of the Department of the Navy, its military and civilian personnel, their families, and the communities in which they live. I am proud to add my voice to those who applaud the consistent and effectual work of this elite organization. NCIS has deep roots in our military history, dating back to 1882, when Secretary of the Navy William H. Hunt established the Office of Naval Intelligence, or ONI, to collect technical information on the world's major naval powers. Since that time, as the United States' role in the world evolved, the need for an elite and specialized investigative branch of ONI became apparent. The Naval Investigative Service, now called NCIS, was born and has fulfilled a vital role in mitigating threats and protecting our Nation. Since then, NCIS has played a vital role in investigating and defeating threats to safety of our Navy and Marine Corps. The organization has grown to employ approximately 2,000 elite personnel and deploys to more than 150 locations around the globe. As such, the organization's broad, yet agile scope has enabled it to ensure the safety of our brave men and women, wherever they are stationed. Their missions have had such broad scope as deployment of special agents to Vietnam, response to the USS Cole and the September 11 terror attacks, and establishment of the Multiple Threat Alert Center for the Department of the Navy. NCIS has executed their duties with distinction and poise under the most strenuous circumstances. I congratulate NCIS on 50 years of success as a premier Federal law enforcement agency. We owe them a debt of gratitude for the elite work they perform in service to our Nation, and I wish them continued success for years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF NCIS Mr. KING.

Mr. President, today I am honored to acknowledge the National Food and Beverage Foundation, an institute based in New Orleans and one that portrays the distinctive culture of Louisiana through its food and drink. Louisiana is known for many things: its bald cypress swamps, Mardi Gras, and its delicious food. Louisiana's cuisine is as unique as the people who make it. From beignets to etouffee and jambalaya to gumbo, food is one of the many characteristics that make Louisiana culture so remarkable. The New Orleans branch of the National Food and Beverage Foundation, or NFBF celebrates that culture through education and is home to the Southern Food and Beverage Museum, praised by CNN as one of the top 11 food museums in the entire world. The National Food and Beverage Foundation is a tremendous example of a group of people using culinary practices to highlight Louisiana's culture while simultaneously enhancing the lives of the people around them. The NFBF has dedicated $5 million for a project to develop one of New Orleans' communities. The project is designed to reestablish sections of New Orleans as a hub of culinary commerce and aid the community in reaching their economic potential. NFBF is also dedicated to education, as evidenced by the John & Bonnie Hospitality and Culinary Library, and to providing free cooking classes for children. The library contains over 17,000 volumes and houses culinary and mixology literature from across the globe. The foundation's Culinary Entrepreneurship Program, a program that aids small businesses, restaurant startups, and product manufacturers, helps young businesses get off the ground. This program and programs like them are invaluable to small businesses throughout Louisiana. The National Food and Beverage Foundation celebrates and encourages Louisiana culture, but it also celebrates cultures through cuisine nationwide. The NFBF is rapidly expanding across the country; Pacific Food and Beverage is based in Los Angeles and celebrates the culture of food and drink of the Pacific coast and the American West. Specifically, Pacific Food and Beverage focuses on contributions made by immigrants who have shaped our Nation's cuisine. Knowing firsthand how important food is to our culture, the preservation of culinary practices and history throughout our country is a crucial endeavor. I want to thank the National Food and Beverage Foundation for all the work it has done with communities in my State and throughout the Nation to preserve and enhance the idea of culture through culinary means. From free children's cooking classes that teach the heritage and nutritional aspects of healthy food, to the Culinary Entrepreneurship Program, NFBF has made a tremendous contribution to Louisiana and the culture loved by so many. I am proud to have such a tremendous initiative in my State, one that explores something so embedded in the Louisiana culture and gives back to the community while doing so. I wish the National Food and Beverage Foundation nothing but successes now and in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL FOOD AND BEVERAGE FOUNDATION Mr. CASSIDY.

Dr. Connie Adler, from Woolwich, ME, currently serves as secretary of the board of directors of Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, as well as on the boards of the Maine Health Access Foundation and Maine Family Planning. During her illustrious career, she has played a leading role in the pursuit of reproductive rights and the prevention of domestic violence.

Elizabeth Ward Saxl, from Vassalboro, ME, has served as the executive director of the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault for the last 16 years. She is a passionate advocate for joining public policy solutions with community-based approaches that address the complex problems impacting Maine's women and girls. Undertaking daunting projects like eliminating statute of limitations on child sexual abuse and creating housing protections for victims of sexual assault, Elizabeth has been a champion of abuse victims across the State. Her work also extends to immigrant, refugee, elder, and native populations, making her a valuable asset to all of Maine's marginalized populations. Congratulations to both Connie and Elizabeth for their induction into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame.

Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Atlantic Regional Federal Credit Union. This nonprofit institution has a long history of serving the people of Maine, and I am proud to add my voice to those in our grateful State in recognizing this milestone. In 1941, Atlantic Regional Federal Credit Union began as St. John's FCU, with just 37 members, in the town of Brunswick. Strong leadership and steadfast dedication to community service has enabled it to become one of the largest credit unions in our State and a bedrock of a thriving Maine midcoast. This truly impressive and steady growth was only possible through a tireless commitment to good service and sound business ethics. Through fundraising, scholarships, donations, and volunteering, Atlantic [[Page S1085]] Regional has promoted the education, health, and wellness of the communities in which it serves. Perhaps most notably, they have undertaken a campaign against hunger by raising funds to donate to local hunger prevention programs. Through the Atlantic Regional Ending Hunger Campaign and Maine CU's Ending Hunger initiative, Atlantic Regional has been at the forefront of an effort that has raised over $5.3 million to help end hunger in Maine. It is through actions like these that Atlantic Regional Federal Credit Union has developed a meaningful connection with its members and the greater community. I extend my congratulations to the Atlantic Regional Federal Credit Union, its employees, its members, and I wish them many years of success to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1084-S1085] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF ATLANTIC REGIONAL FEDERAL CREDIT UNION Mr. KING.

Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 524, to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--OVERDOSE PREVENTION SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Overdose Prevention Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each day in the United States, more than 100 people die from a drug overdose. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose causes more deaths than motor vehicle accidents. (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose in 2013 alone. More than 80 percent of those deaths were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many could have been prevented. (3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses increased more than 300 percent between 1980 and 1998, and more than tripled between 1999 and 2013. (4) Nearly 92 percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths are due to drugs. Since 1999, in the United States the population of non-Hispanic Whites and the population of Indians (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) have seen the highest rates of unintentional drug poisoning deaths. (5) Opioid medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone were involved in nearly 46 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (6) Unintentional drug poisoning deaths involving heroin nearly tripled between 2010 and 2013 and were 23 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (7) Between 1999 and 2010, opioid medication overdose fatalities increased by more than 400 percent among women and 265 percent among men. (8) Military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing a drug overdose. Veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan and who have combat injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other co-occurring mental health diagnoses are at elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from opioid medications. (9) Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately affected by opioid medication and heroin overdoses. From 2000 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths involving heroin has increased nearly 11-fold in the Midwest region and more than 3-fold in the South region. (10) Urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults. (11) In 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded $20,000,000,000. (12) Opioid medication poisonings cost health insurers an estimated $72,000,000,000 annually in medical costs. (13) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no coordinated cross-Federal agency response to prevent overdose fatalities. (14) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses overdose from heroin and opioid medications. (15) Naloxone has no pharmacological effect if administered to a person who has not taken opioids and has no potential for abuse. Naloxone provides additional time to obtain necessary medical assistance during an overdose. (16) Lawmakers in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have removed legal impediments to increasing naloxone prescription and its use by bystanders who are in a position to respond to an overdose. (17) The American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association support further implementation of community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid overdose prevention services. (18) Community-based overdose prevention programs have successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making rescue training and naloxone available to first responders, parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. A study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of community-based overdose prevention programs provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that communities with access to overdose prevention programs experienced lower mortality rates from opioid overdoses than communities that did not have access to overdose prevention programs during the study period. (19) Over 150,000 potential bystanders have been trained by overdose prevention programs in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report credits overdose prevention programs with reversing more than 26,000 overdoses since 1996. (20) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are operating in the United States, including in major cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New Mexico, Massachusetts, and New York. Between December 2007 and March 2014, overdose prevention programs facilitated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health trained more than 22,500 people who reported more than 2,655 rescues. Since 2004, a program administered by the Baltimore City Health Department has trained more than 11,000 people who reported more than 220 rescues. Project Lazarus, an overdose prevention program in Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced overdose deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011. (21) In Illinois, the Department of Human Services, Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse has enrolled over 20 drug overdose prevention programs with over 100 designated sites across Illinois targeting multiple service populations. These enrollees include police departments, county health departments, medical facilities, licensed substance abuse treatment programs, and community organizations. Statewide, over 2,000 police officers and more than 600 others have been trained thus far. The DuPage County Illinois Health Department has trained over 1,200 police officers and has reported 34 overdose reversals in 2014 alone. (22) The Office of National Drug Control Policy supports equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. Police officers on patrol in Quincy, Massachusetts, have conducted 300 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. The police department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose rescue attempts by police officers. In Suffolk County, New York, police officers have saved more than 563 lives with naloxone in 2013 alone. (23) Research shows that the cost per year of life gained by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the range of what people in the United States usually pay for health treatments. (24) Prompt administration of naloxone and provision of emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. (25) Overdose prevention programs are needed in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing after a period of abstinence. (26) Timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance data at the local, State, and regional level is critically needed to target prevention efforts. (27) People affected by drug overdose gather on August 31 of each year in communities nationwide for Overdose Awareness Day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and [[Page S1091]] raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention.

Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 524, to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--OVERDOSE PREVENTION SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Overdose Prevention Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each day in the United States, more than 100 people die from a drug overdose. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose causes more deaths than motor vehicle accidents. (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose in 2013 alone. More than 80 percent of those deaths were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many could have been prevented. (3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses increased more than 300 percent between 1980 and 1998, and more than tripled between 1999 and 2013. (4) Nearly 92 percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths are due to drugs. Since 1999, in the United States the population of non-Hispanic Whites and the population of Indians (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) have seen the highest rates of unintentional drug poisoning deaths. (5) Opioid medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone were involved in nearly 46 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (6) Unintentional drug poisoning deaths involving heroin nearly tripled between 2010 and 2013 and were 23 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (7) Between 1999 and 2010, opioid medication overdose fatalities increased by more than 400 percent among women and 265 percent among men. (8) Military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing a drug overdose. Veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan and who have combat injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other co-occurring mental health diagnoses are at elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from opioid medications. (9) Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately affected by opioid medication and heroin overdoses. From 2000 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths involving heroin has increased nearly 11-fold in the Midwest region and more than 3-fold in the South region. (10) Urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults. (11) In 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded $20,000,000,000. (12) Opioid medication poisonings cost health insurers an estimated $72,000,000,000 annually in medical costs. (13) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no coordinated cross-Federal agency response to prevent overdose fatalities. (14) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses overdose from heroin and opioid medications. (15) Naloxone has no pharmacological effect if administered to a person who has not taken opioids and has no potential for abuse. Naloxone provides additional time to obtain necessary medical assistance during an overdose. (16) Lawmakers in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have removed legal impediments to increasing naloxone prescription and its use by bystanders who are in a position to respond to an overdose. (17) The American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association support further implementation of community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid overdose prevention services. (18) Community-based overdose prevention programs have successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making rescue training and naloxone available to first responders, parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. A study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of community-based overdose prevention programs provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that communities with access to overdose prevention programs experienced lower mortality rates from opioid overdoses than communities that did not have access to overdose prevention programs during the study period. (19) Over 150,000 potential bystanders have been trained by overdose prevention programs in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report credits overdose prevention programs with reversing more than 26,000 overdoses since 1996. (20) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are operating in the United States, including in major cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New Mexico, Massachusetts, and New York. Between December 2007 and March 2014, overdose prevention programs facilitated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health trained more than 22,500 people who reported more than 2,655 rescues. Since 2004, a program administered by the Baltimore City Health Department has trained more than 11,000 people who reported more than 220 rescues. Project Lazarus, an overdose prevention program in Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced overdose deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011. (21) In Illinois, the Department of Human Services, Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse has enrolled over 20 drug overdose prevention programs with over 100 designated sites across Illinois targeting multiple service populations. These enrollees include police departments, county health departments, medical facilities, licensed substance abuse treatment programs, and community organizations. Statewide, over 2,000 police officers and more than 600 others have been trained thus far. The DuPage County Illinois Health Department has trained over 1,200 police officers and has reported 34 overdose reversals in 2014 alone. (22) The Office of National Drug Control Policy supports equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. Police officers on patrol in Quincy, Massachusetts, have conducted 300 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. The police department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose rescue attempts by police officers. In Suffolk County, New York, police officers have saved more than 563 lives with naloxone in 2013 alone. (23) Research shows that the cost per year of life gained by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the range of what people in the United States usually pay for health treatments. (24) Prompt administration of naloxone and provision of emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. (25) Overdose prevention programs are needed in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing after a period of abstinence. (26) Timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance data at the local, State, and regional level is critically needed to target prevention efforts. (27) People affected by drug overdose gather on August 31 of each year in communities nationwide for Overdose Awareness Day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and [[Page S1091]] raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention.

Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 524, to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--OVERDOSE PREVENTION SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Overdose Prevention Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each day in the United States, more than 100 people die from a drug overdose. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose causes more deaths than motor vehicle accidents. (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose in 2013 alone. More than 80 percent of those deaths were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many could have been prevented. (3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses increased more than 300 percent between 1980 and 1998, and more than tripled between 1999 and 2013. (4) Nearly 92 percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths are due to drugs. Since 1999, in the United States the population of non-Hispanic Whites and the population of Indians (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) have seen the highest rates of unintentional drug poisoning deaths. (5) Opioid medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone were involved in nearly 46 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (6) Unintentional drug poisoning deaths involving heroin nearly tripled between 2010 and 2013 and were 23 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (7) Between 1999 and 2010, opioid medication overdose fatalities increased by more than 400 percent among women and 265 percent among men. (8) Military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing a drug overdose. Veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan and who have combat injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other co-occurring mental health diagnoses are at elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from opioid medications. (9) Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately affected by opioid medication and heroin overdoses. From 2000 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths involving heroin has increased nearly 11-fold in the Midwest region and more than 3-fold in the South region. (10) Urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults. (11) In 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded $20,000,000,000. (12) Opioid medication poisonings cost health insurers an estimated $72,000,000,000 annually in medical costs. (13) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no coordinated cross-Federal agency response to prevent overdose fatalities. (14) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses overdose from heroin and opioid medications. (15) Naloxone has no pharmacological effect if administered to a person who has not taken opioids and has no potential for abuse. Naloxone provides additional time to obtain necessary medical assistance during an overdose. (16) Lawmakers in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have removed legal impediments to increasing naloxone prescription and its use by bystanders who are in a position to respond to an overdose. (17) The American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association support further implementation of community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid overdose prevention services. (18) Community-based overdose prevention programs have successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making rescue training and naloxone available to first responders, parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. A study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of community-based overdose prevention programs provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that communities with access to overdose prevention programs experienced lower mortality rates from opioid overdoses than communities that did not have access to overdose prevention programs during the study period. (19) Over 150,000 potential bystanders have been trained by overdose prevention programs in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report credits overdose prevention programs with reversing more than 26,000 overdoses since 1996. (20) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are operating in the United States, including in major cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New Mexico, Massachusetts, and New York. Between December 2007 and March 2014, overdose prevention programs facilitated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health trained more than 22,500 people who reported more than 2,655 rescues. Since 2004, a program administered by the Baltimore City Health Department has trained more than 11,000 people who reported more than 220 rescues. Project Lazarus, an overdose prevention program in Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced overdose deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011. (21) In Illinois, the Department of Human Services, Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse has enrolled over 20 drug overdose prevention programs with over 100 designated sites across Illinois targeting multiple service populations. These enrollees include police departments, county health departments, medical facilities, licensed substance abuse treatment programs, and community organizations. Statewide, over 2,000 police officers and more than 600 others have been trained thus far. The DuPage County Illinois Health Department has trained over 1,200 police officers and has reported 34 overdose reversals in 2014 alone. (22) The Office of National Drug Control Policy supports equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. Police officers on patrol in Quincy, Massachusetts, have conducted 300 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. The police department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose rescue attempts by police officers. In Suffolk County, New York, police officers have saved more than 563 lives with naloxone in 2013 alone. (23) Research shows that the cost per year of life gained by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the range of what people in the United States usually pay for health treatments. (24) Prompt administration of naloxone and provision of emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. (25) Overdose prevention programs are needed in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing after a period of abstinence. (26) Timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance data at the local, State, and regional level is critically needed to target prevention efforts. (27) People affected by drug overdose gather on August 31 of each year in communities nationwide for Overdose Awareness Day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and [[Page S1091]] raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention.

(8) military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing a drug overdose. veterans who served in vietnam, iraq, or afghanistan and who have combat injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other co-occurring mental health diagnoses are at elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from opioid medications. (9) rural and suburban regions are disproportionately affected by opioid medication and heroin overdoses. from 2000 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths involving heroin has increased nearly 11-fold in the midwest region and more than 3-fold in the south region. (10) urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults. (11) in 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded $20,000,000,000. (12) opioid medication poisonings cost health insurers an estimated $72,000,000,000 annually in medical costs. (13) both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no coordinated cross-federal agency response to prevent overdose fatalities. (14) naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses overdose from heroin and opioid medications. (15) naloxone has no pharmacological effect if administered to a person who has not taken opioids and has no potential for abuse. naloxone provides additional time to obtain necessary medical assistance during an overdose. (16) lawmakers in arkansas, california, colorado, connecticut, delaware, georgia, idaho, illinois, indiana, kentucky, maine, maryland, massachusetts, michigan, minnesota, mississippi, nevada, new jersey, new mexico, new york, north carolina, north dakota, ohio, oklahoma, oregon, pennsylvania, rhode island, tennessee, utah, vermont, virginia, washington, west virginia, wisconsin, and the district of columbia have removed legal impediments to increasing naloxone prescription and its use by bystanders who are in a position to respond to an overdose. (17) the american medical association and the american public health association support further implementation of community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid overdose prevention services. (18) community-based overdose prevention programs have successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making rescue training and naloxone available to first responders, parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. a study funded by the centers for disease control and prevention of community-based overdose prevention programs provided by the massachusetts department of public health found that communities with access to overdose prevention programs experienced lower mortality rates from opioid overdoses than communities that did not have access to overdose prevention programs during the study period. (19) over 150,000 potential bystanders have been trained by overdose prevention programs in the united states. a centers for disease control and prevention report credits overdose prevention programs with reversing more than 26,000 overdoses since 1996. (20) at least 188 local overdose prevention programs are operating in the united states, including in major cities such as baltimore, chicago, los angeles, new york city, boston, san francisco, and philadelphia, and statewide in new mexico, massachusetts, and new york. between december 2007 and march 2014, overdose prevention programs facilitated by the massachusetts department of public health trained more than 22,500 people who reported more than 2,655 rescues. since 2004, a program administered by the baltimore city health department has trained more than 11,000 people who reported more than 220 rescues. project lazarus, an overdose prevention program in wilkes county, north carolina, reduced overdose deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011. (21) in illinois, the department of human services, division of alcoholism and substance abuse has enrolled over 20 drug overdose prevention programs with over 100 designated sites across illinois targeting multiple service populations. these enrollees include police departments, county health departments, medical facilities, licensed substance abuse treatment programs, and community organizations. statewide, over 2,000 police officers and more than 600 others have been trained thus far. the dupage county illinois health department has trained over 1,200 police officers and has reported 34 overdose reversals in 2014 alone. (22) the office of national drug control policy supports equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. police officers on patrol in quincy, massachusetts, have conducted 300 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. the police department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose rescue attempts by police officers. in suffolk county, new york, police officers have saved more than 563 lives with naloxone in 2013 alone. (23) research shows that the cost per year of life gained by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the range of what people in the united states usually pay for health treatments. (24) prompt administration of naloxone and provision of emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. (25) overdose prevention programs are needed in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing after a period of abstinence. (26) timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance data at the local, state, and regional level is critically needed to target prevention efforts. (27) people affected by drug overdose gather on august 31 of each year in communities nationwide for overdose awareness day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and [[page s1091]] raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention. sec. _03. overdose prevention programs. title iii of the public health service act (42 u.s.c. 241 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``part w--overdose prevention programs ``sec. 399oo. cooperative agreement program to reduce drug overdose deaths. ``(a) program authorized.--the secretary, acting through the administrator of the substance abuse and mental health services administration, shall enter into cooperative agreements with eligible entities to enable the eligible entities to reduce deaths occurring from overdoses of drugs. ``(b) eligible entities.--to be eligible to receive a cooperative agreement under this section, an entity shall be a state, local, or tribal government, a correctional institution, a law enforcement agency, a community agency, a professional organization in the field of poison control and surveillance, or a private nonprofit organization. ``(c) application.-- ``(1) in general.--an eligible entity desiring a cooperative agreement under this section shall submit to the secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the secretary may require. ``(2) contents.--an application under paragraph (1) shall include-- ``(a) a description of the activities to be funded through the cooperative agreement;

Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 524, to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--OVERDOSE PREVENTION SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Overdose Prevention Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each day in the United States, more than 100 people die from a drug overdose. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose causes more deaths than motor vehicle accidents. (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose in 2013 alone. More than 80 percent of those deaths were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many could have been prevented. (3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses increased more than 300 percent between 1980 and 1998, and more than tripled between 1999 and 2013. (4) Nearly 92 percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths are due to drugs. Since 1999, in the United States the population of non-Hispanic Whites and the population of Indians (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) have seen the highest rates of unintentional drug poisoning deaths. (5) Opioid medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone were involved in nearly 46 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (6) Unintentional drug poisoning deaths involving heroin nearly tripled between 2010 and 2013 and were 23 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (7) Between 1999 and 2010, opioid medication overdose fatalities increased by more than 400 percent among women and 265 percent among men. (8) Military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing a drug overdose. Veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan and who have combat injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other co-occurring mental health diagnoses are at elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from opioid medications. (9) Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately affected by opioid medication and heroin overdoses. From 2000 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths involving heroin has increased nearly 11-fold in the Midwest region and more than 3-fold in the South region. (10) Urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults. (11) In 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded $20,000,000,000. (12) Opioid medication poisonings cost health insurers an estimated $72,000,000,000 annually in medical costs. (13) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no coordinated cross-Federal agency response to prevent overdose fatalities. (14) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses overdose from heroin and opioid medications. (15) Naloxone has no pharmacological effect if administered to a person who has not taken opioids and has no potential for abuse. Naloxone provides additional time to obtain necessary medical assistance during an overdose. (16) Lawmakers in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have removed legal impediments to increasing naloxone prescription and its use by bystanders who are in a position to respond to an overdose. (17) The American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association support further implementation of community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid overdose prevention services. (18) Community-based overdose prevention programs have successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making rescue training and naloxone available to first responders, parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. A study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of community-based overdose prevention programs provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that communities with access to overdose prevention programs experienced lower mortality rates from opioid overdoses than communities that did not have access to overdose prevention programs during the study period. (19) Over 150,000 potential bystanders have been trained by overdose prevention programs in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report credits overdose prevention programs with reversing more than 26,000 overdoses since 1996. (20) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are operating in the United States, including in major cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New Mexico, Massachusetts, and New York. Between December 2007 and March 2014, overdose prevention programs facilitated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health trained more than 22,500 people who reported more than 2,655 rescues. Since 2004, a program administered by the Baltimore City Health Department has trained more than 11,000 people who reported more than 220 rescues. Project Lazarus, an overdose prevention program in Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced overdose deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011. (21) In Illinois, the Department of Human Services, Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse has enrolled over 20 drug overdose prevention programs with over 100 designated sites across Illinois targeting multiple service populations. These enrollees include police departments, county health departments, medical facilities, licensed substance abuse treatment programs, and community organizations. Statewide, over 2,000 police officers and more than 600 others have been trained thus far. The DuPage County Illinois Health Department has trained over 1,200 police officers and has reported 34 overdose reversals in 2014 alone. (22) The Office of National Drug Control Policy supports equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. Police officers on patrol in Quincy, Massachusetts, have conducted 300 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. The police department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose rescue attempts by police officers. In Suffolk County, New York, police officers have saved more than 563 lives with naloxone in 2013 alone. (23) Research shows that the cost per year of life gained by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the range of what people in the United States usually pay for health treatments. (24) Prompt administration of naloxone and provision of emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. (25) Overdose prevention programs are needed in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing after a period of abstinence. (26) Timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance data at the local, State, and regional level is critically needed to target prevention efforts. (27) People affected by drug overdose gather on August 31 of each year in communities nationwide for Overdose Awareness Day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and [[Page S1091]] raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention.

Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 524, to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--OVERDOSE PREVENTION SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Overdose Prevention Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each day in the United States, more than 100 people die from a drug overdose. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose causes more deaths than motor vehicle accidents. (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose in 2013 alone. More than 80 percent of those deaths were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many could have been prevented. (3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses increased more than 300 percent between 1980 and 1998, and more than tripled between 1999 and 2013. (4) Nearly 92 percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths are due to drugs. Since 1999, in the United States the population of non-Hispanic Whites and the population of Indians (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) have seen the highest rates of unintentional drug poisoning deaths. (5) Opioid medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone were involved in nearly 46 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (6) Unintentional drug poisoning deaths involving heroin nearly tripled between 2010 and 2013 and were 23 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013. (7) Between 1999 and 2010, opioid medication overdose fatalities increased by more than 400 percent among women and 265 percent among men. (8) Military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing a drug overdose. Veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan and who have combat injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other co-occurring mental health diagnoses are at elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from opioid medications. (9) Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately affected by opioid medication and heroin overdoses. From 2000 through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths involving heroin has increased nearly 11-fold in the Midwest region and more than 3-fold in the South region. (10) Urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults. (11) In 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded $20,000,000,000. (12) Opioid medication poisonings cost health insurers an estimated $72,000,000,000 annually in medical costs. (13) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no coordinated cross-Federal agency response to prevent overdose fatalities. (14) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses overdose from heroin and opioid medications. (15) Naloxone has no pharmacological effect if administered to a person who has not taken opioids and has no potential for abuse. Naloxone provides additional time to obtain necessary medical assistance during an overdose. (16) Lawmakers in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have removed legal impediments to increasing naloxone prescription and its use by bystanders who are in a position to respond to an overdose. (17) The American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association support further implementation of community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid overdose prevention services. (18) Community-based overdose prevention programs have successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making rescue training and naloxone available to first responders, parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. A study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of community-based overdose prevention programs provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that communities with access to overdose prevention programs experienced lower mortality rates from opioid overdoses than communities that did not have access to overdose prevention programs during the study period. (19) Over 150,000 potential bystanders have been trained by overdose prevention programs in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report credits overdose prevention programs with reversing more than 26,000 overdoses since 1996. (20) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are operating in the United States, including in major cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New Mexico, Massachusetts, and New York. Between December 2007 and March 2014, overdose prevention programs facilitated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health trained more than 22,500 people who reported more than 2,655 rescues. Since 2004, a program administered by the Baltimore City Health Department has trained more than 11,000 people who reported more than 220 rescues. Project Lazarus, an overdose prevention program in Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced overdose deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011. (21) In Illinois, the Department of Human Services, Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse has enrolled over 20 drug overdose prevention programs with over 100 designated sites across Illinois targeting multiple service populations. These enrollees include police departments, county health departments, medical facilities, licensed substance abuse treatment programs, and community organizations. Statewide, over 2,000 police officers and more than 600 others have been trained thus far. The DuPage County Illinois Health Department has trained over 1,200 police officers and has reported 34 overdose reversals in 2014 alone. (22) The Office of National Drug Control Policy supports equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. Police officers on patrol in Quincy, Massachusetts, have conducted 300 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. The police department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose rescue attempts by police officers. In Suffolk County, New York, police officers have saved more than 563 lives with naloxone in 2013 alone. (23) Research shows that the cost per year of life gained by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the range of what people in the United States usually pay for health treatments. (24) Prompt administration of naloxone and provision of emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. (25) Overdose prevention programs are needed in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing after a period of abstinence. (26) Timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance data at the local, State, and regional level is critically needed to target prevention efforts. (27) People affected by drug overdose gather on August 31 of each year in communities nationwide for Overdose Awareness Day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and [[Page S1091]] raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention.

(22) the office of national drug control policy supports equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. police officers on patrol in quincy, massachusetts, have conducted 300 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. the police department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose rescue attempts by police officers. in suffolk county, new york, police officers have saved more than 563 lives with naloxone in 2013 alone. (23) research shows that the cost per year of life gained by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the range of what people in the united states usually pay for health treatments. (24) prompt administration of naloxone and provision of emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. (25) overdose prevention programs are needed in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing after a period of abstinence. (26) timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance data at the local, state, and regional level is critically needed to target prevention efforts. (27) people affected by drug overdose gather on august 31 of each year in communities nationwide for overdose awareness day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and [[page s1091]] raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention. sec. _03. overdose prevention programs. title iii of the public health service act (42 u.s.c. 241 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``part w--overdose prevention programs ``sec. 399oo. cooperative agreement program to reduce drug overdose deaths. ``(a) program authorized.--the secretary, acting through the administrator of the substance abuse and mental health services administration, shall enter into cooperative agreements with eligible entities to enable the eligible entities to reduce deaths occurring from overdoses of drugs. ``(b) eligible entities.--to be eligible to receive a cooperative agreement under this section, an entity shall be a state, local, or tribal government, a correctional institution, a law enforcement agency, a community agency, a professional organization in the field of poison control and surveillance, or a private nonprofit organization. ``(c) application.-- ``(1) in general.--an eligible entity desiring a cooperative agreement under this section shall submit to the secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the secretary may require. ``(2) contents.--an application under paragraph (1) shall include-- ``(a) a description of the activities to be funded through the cooperative agreement;

CREC-2016-02-29-pt1-PgS1103-2,CREC-2016-02-29,114,OPIOID ADDICTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1103-S1104] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OPIOID ADDICTION Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tonight the Senate voted to turn its attention to the issue of opioid addiction. Clearly, what we know now is that opioid addiction has carved a path of destruction across America--a path of destruction from Medford, OR, to Manchester, NH. During a number of community forums I held across my State just a few days ago, we talked about how we are going to grapple with this great challenge and what it is going to take to really turn the problem around. My home State has the dubious distinction of ranking fourth worst for abuse and misuse of opioids in America. In my State, citizens made it very clear: They are not going to accept being fourth worst. I know from talking with many of my colleagues that a whole host of States are dealing with this challenge, and what I have been struck by is how opioid addiction keeps manifesting itself in ways we certainly wouldn't have known about even 10 or 15 years ago. At home in Oregon, I was particularly struck with parents who told me about high school athletes struggling with addiction to opioids. When I played basketball, dreaming of playing in the NBA, there was never any talk in the locker room about opioids. Now the next generation of young athletes seems to be getting caught up in this. If they have an injury, young people get down when they are not able to play sports. They get depressed. Maybe they go to a party. Maybe it starts with some alcohol. Maybe it starts with a prescription. But all of a sudden, it mushrooms and grows. This is what parents were telling me at home, and it is clear that Congress cannot sit on the side lines while the opioid addiction problem continues to mushroom. In the coming years, Medicare and Medicaid are expected to account for over a third of substance abuse-related spending. We are talking about billions of dollars each year. As the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, which is required to pay for these bedrock health programs, I want to talk just for a little bit tonight about the critical role these programs are going to play in stemming the tide of opioid abuse. I would like to begin by saying that it is my view that the American people are paying for a distorted set of priorities. Our people are getting hooked on opioids, there is not enough treatment, and vigorous enforcement is falling short. That, in my view, is a trifecta of misplaced priorities. And while it is not all going to be done this week, beginning this week the Congress has the opportunity to develop fresh policies that will begin to right the ship. Last week the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to discuss the opioid crisis. As I listened to the debate, there was a sense that policymakers are sort of lined up to choose between two sides. One is tough enforcement, which means cracking down on pill mills, fraudsters bilking Medicare and Medicaid with unneeded prescriptions, and unscrupulous abusers who doctor shop for their next bottle of pills. Then there is another side that believes there should be more focus on social services. My own view is that what is needed is a better approach that includes three priorities: more prevention, better treatment, and, yes, tougher enforcement. True success is going to require that all three work in tandem. When it comes to preventing addiction, any discussion has to include how these drugs are prescribed in the first place. I have come to feel, as I got around Oregon and I listened to the testimony in the Finance Committee here recently, what has happened is America, for the last 15 or so years, has been on a prescription pendulum, where doctors were once criticized for not treating pain aggressively enough, today they seem to be criticized for prescribing too many opioids to manage pain. In my view, our challenge is to work on a bipartisan basis to get this balance right. Of course we want our people to have an opportunity for science-based pain management, and we also don't want indiscriminate prescribing of opioids. It is about getting the balance right with respect to this prescription pendulum that our country has been on for the last 15 or 20 years. I am pleased the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is breaking new ground with their guidelines for prescribing opioids. If successful, I believe they could provide a meaningful reduction in overprescribing. I have also been concerned about the influence opioid manufacturers have on prescribing practices. So I have sent to the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee an inquiry to Secretary Burwell to ensure that any potential conflicts of interest have been properly disclosed for members of government panels who are evaluating the Centers for Disease Control guidelines as a result of funding they receive from drug manufacturers. Our physicians ought to have the best information on prescribing these powerful drugs without undue influence from the companies that are manufacturing. In my view, a key piece of solving the opioid addiction puzzle has to be prompt and effective treatment of those who are dealing with an addiction to opioids. The Finance Committee had three witnesses last week: a witness who was chosen by our distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, a witness I chose, and an expert who was well thought of by all sides. The question was, How do you solve this opioid addiction challenge if you just restrict access to opioids? I personally believe that kind of enforcement regime should be part of a solution, and I support that, but if all you do is restrict access to opioids, each of these experts--the one chosen by Chairman Hatch, the one I chose, independent expert, all of them said if all you do is restrict access to opioids, the addiction does not go away. The addiction doesn't just magically disappear. I hope we can emphasize this as the Senate begins our debate. Any lasting solution is going to have to have enforcement, which this bill focuses on, but it is also going to have to have treatment and prevention. We are going to have to improve access to addiction treatment and mental health services. I know the distinguished President of the Senate, like my State, has a lot of rural communities, and it is going to be particularly important to ensure that they are served. I think the distinguished President of the Senate knows it is not a surprise that some of the rural communities have some of the highest rates of abuse and opiate overdose in the country. Mental health treatment for addiction certainly has gotten short shrift for too long. It is too important to have that kind of policy, and it is high time for a change. For example, Congress ought to also be taking a look at what is called the IMD exclusion, an out-of-date policy from the 1960s that says services like rehab or some emergency mental health stay in an inpatient setting can't be covered by Medicaid. That is a big policy change. I think it is important that we debate it, and I think we all understand finding the vast sums needed for those services would be a unique challenge. Like so many other important issues, at the end of the day, this requires that our Congress make some tough choices. Yet if prevention and treatment are not locked in upfront, we ought to realize that if those are our choices, to not give adequate emphasis to prevention and treatment, the overall bill is going to come in even higher--pregnant mothers giving birth to opioid-dependent babies, EMTs and emergency rooms dealing with overdose calls every night, county jails taking the place of needed substance abuse treatment, able-bodied adults in the streets instead of working in the private sector at a family wage job. America's tax dollars ought to be spent more wisely. So as we begin this debate, we begin [[Page S1104]] the debate by tackling the opioid scourge that has carved the path of destruction, a path of destruction from one end of the country to another. The Senate has to find the right mix between prevention, treatment, and enforcement. It is going to be that kind of strategy, a fresh strategy where prevention, treatment, and enforcement work in tandem. That is going make a real difference for our families and our communities struggling to heal. I hope those who may have followed this speech will recognize that I haven't talked about Democrats and Republicans. I have been talking about a set of approaches we can all work on together. In fact, all three of the witnesses who were before the Finance Committee made it clear that you had to have those three approaches--prevention, treatment, and enforcement--work in tandem if you want to solve the problem. I think it is important Democrats and Republicans recognize what those experts and others have said is going to be necessary to help our families and communities across this country heal. We can do it in a bipartisan fashion. I am committed to working in just that manner. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request? Mr. WYDEN. Yes. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1103-S1104] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OPIOID ADDICTION Mr. WYDEN.

I have come to feel, as I got around Oregon and I listened to the testimony in the Finance Committee here recently, what has happened is America, for the last 15 or so years, has been on a prescription pendulum, where doctors were once criticized for not treating pain aggressively enough, today they seem to be criticized for prescribing too many opioids to manage pain. In my view, our challenge is to work on a bipartisan basis to get this balance right. Of course we want our people to have an opportunity for science-based pain management, and we also don't want indiscriminate prescribing of opioids. It is about getting the balance right with respect to this prescription pendulum that our country has been on for the last 15 or 20 years. I am pleased the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is breaking new ground with their guidelines for prescribing opioids. If successful, I believe they could provide a meaningful reduction in overprescribing. I have also been concerned about the influence opioid manufacturers have on prescribing practices. So I have sent to the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee an inquiry to Secretary Burwell to ensure that any potential conflicts of interest have been properly disclosed for members of government panels who are evaluating the Centers for Disease Control guidelines as a result of funding they receive from drug manufacturers. Our physicians ought to have the best information on prescribing these powerful drugs without undue influence from the companies that are manufacturing. In my view, a key piece of solving the opioid addiction puzzle has to be prompt and effective treatment of those who are dealing with an addiction to opioids. The Finance Committee had three witnesses last week: a witness who was chosen by our distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, a witness I chose, and an expert who was well thought of by all sides. The question was, How do you solve this opioid addiction challenge if you just restrict access to opioids? I personally believe that kind of enforcement regime should be part of a solution, and I support that, but if all you do is restrict access to opioids, each of these experts--the one chosen by Chairman Hatch, the one I chose, independent expert, all of them said if all you do is restrict access to opioids, the addiction does not go away. The addiction doesn't just magically disappear. I hope we can emphasize this as the Senate begins our debate. Any lasting solution is going to have to have enforcement, which this bill focuses on, but it is also going to have to have treatment and prevention. We are going to have to improve access to addiction treatment and mental health services. I know the distinguished President of the Senate, like my State, has a lot of rural communities, and it is going to be particularly important to ensure that they are served. I think the distinguished President of the Senate knows it is not a surprise that some of the rural communities have some of the highest rates of abuse and opiate overdose in the country. Mental health treatment for addiction certainly has gotten short shrift for too long. It is too important to have that kind of policy, and it is high time for a change. For example, Congress ought to also be taking a look at what is called the IMD exclusion, an out-of-date policy from the 1960s that says services like rehab or some emergency mental health stay in an inpatient setting can't be covered by Medicaid. That is a big policy change. I think it is important that we debate it, and I think we all understand finding the vast sums needed for those services would be a unique challenge. Like so many other important issues, at the end of the day, this requires that our Congress make some tough choices. Yet if prevention and treatment are not locked in upfront, we ought to realize that if those are our choices, to not give adequate emphasis to prevention and treatment, the overall bill is going to come in even higher--pregnant mothers giving birth to opioid-dependent babies, EMTs and emergency rooms dealing with overdose calls every night, county jails taking the place of needed substance abuse treatment, able-bodied adults in the streets instead of working in the private sector at a family wage job. America's tax dollars ought to be spent more wisely. So as we begin this debate, we begin [[Page S1104]] the debate by tackling the opioid scourge that has carved the path of destruction, a path of destruction from one end of the country to another. The Senate has to find the right mix between prevention, treatment, and enforcement. It is going to be that kind of strategy, a fresh strategy where prevention, treatment, and enforcement work in tandem. That is going make a real difference for our families and our communities struggling to heal. I hope those who may have followed this speech will recognize that I haven't talked about Democrats and Republicans. I have been talking about a set of approaches we can all work on together. In fact, all three of the witnesses who were before the Finance Committee made it clear that you had to have those three approaches--prevention, treatment, and enforcement--work in tandem if you want to solve the problem. I think it is important Democrats and Republicans recognize what those experts and others have said is going to be necessary to help our families and communities across this country heal. We can do it in a bipartisan fashion. I am committed to working in just that manner. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tonight the Senate voted to turn its attention to the issue of opioid addiction. Clearly, what we know now is that opioid addiction has carved a path of destruction across America--a path of destruction from Medford, OR, to Manchester, NH. During a number of community forums I held across my State just a few days ago, we talked about how we are going to grapple with this great challenge and what it is going to take to really turn the problem around. My home State has the dubious distinction of ranking fourth worst for abuse and misuse of opioids in America. In my State, citizens made it very clear: They are not going to accept being fourth worst. I know from talking with many of my colleagues that a whole host of States are dealing with this challenge, and what I have been struck by is how opioid addiction keeps manifesting itself in ways we certainly wouldn't have known about even 10 or 15 years ago. At home in Oregon, I was particularly struck with parents who told me about high school athletes struggling with addiction to opioids. When I played basketball, dreaming of playing in the NBA, there was never any talk in the locker room about opioids. Now the next generation of young athletes seems to be getting caught up in this. If they have an injury, young people get down when they are not able to play sports. They get depressed. Maybe they go to a party. Maybe it starts with some alcohol. Maybe it starts with a prescription. But all of a sudden, it mushrooms and grows. This is what parents were telling me at home, and it is clear that Congress cannot sit on the side lines while the opioid addiction problem continues to mushroom. In the coming years, Medicare and Medicaid are expected to account for over a third of substance abuse-related spending. We are talking about billions of dollars each year. As the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, which is required to pay for these bedrock health programs, I want to talk just for a little bit tonight about the critical role these programs are going to play in stemming the tide of opioid abuse. I would like to begin by saying that it is my view that the American people are paying for a distorted set of priorities. Our people are getting hooked on opioids, there is not enough treatment, and vigorous enforcement is falling short. That, in my view, is a trifecta of misplaced priorities. And while it is not all going to be done this week, beginning this week the Congress has the opportunity to develop fresh policies that will begin to right the ship. Last week the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to discuss the opioid crisis. As I listened to the debate, there was a sense that policymakers are sort of lined up to choose between two sides. One is tough enforcement, which means cracking down on pill mills, fraudsters bilking Medicare and Medicaid with unneeded prescriptions, and unscrupulous abusers who doctor shop for their next bottle of pills. Then there is another side that believes there should be more focus on social services. My own view is that what is needed is a better approach that includes three priorities: more prevention, better treatment, and, yes, tougher enforcement. True success is going to require that all three work in tandem. When it comes to preventing addiction, any discussion has to include how these drugs are prescribed in the first place.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, February 29, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, a hearing I held earlier this week put a spotlight on an organization that is a critical component of a global system of intellectual property and patent protection, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO. It is an organization that, unfortunately, appears to have lost its way under its current Director General, Francis Gurry, and is in need of major reform. We heard from whistleblowers who related how they uncovered illicit transfers of technology to rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran, and how WIPO under Director General Gurry, unbeknownst to member States, cut deals with China and Russia to open offices in those countries, potentially putting our intellectual property at risk. The hearing was about national security as much as the importance of sound governance and oversight. China, for example, has a notoriously bad record on protecting intellectual property rights--WIPO ought to be part of the solution. You may know that I serve as Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China; Senator Marco Rubio is co-chair. Ominously, the Commission's latest annual report released last October concluded that human rights violations had significantly worsened and were broader in scope than at any other time since the Commission was established in 2002. Last week I travelled to China on a mission to promote human rights, the rule of law and democracy, which of course includes intellectual property rights. In China I not only met and argued with government leaders, but I had the privilege of writing and delivering a keynote address to students and faculty at New York University-Shanghai. Hopes in the 90's that China would eventually and inevitably matriculate from a dictatorship to democracy haven't even come close to materializing. According to the Commission's report, U.S. companies faced significant difficulties related to intellectual property rights in China. And China is not the only place where these problems persist. Two of our witnesses, Jim Pooley and Miranda Brown, recounted what they saw at WIPO, and what happened when they sought to bring to light what they saw. It is not a pretty story. It is the personal aspect of governance and oversight that I want to emphasize, because at its heart the story we heard is a human drama, about brave individuals who at great personal cost to themselves and their comfort saw wrongdoing and decided to do something about it. The hearing was timely as well as topical, as there has been an internal investigation of WIPO by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services into the allegations of wrongdoing. The results of this investigation are currently before the chairman of WIPO's General Assembly--this is a General Assembly of member states, including the United States, based in Geneva. It is incumbent upon the General Assembly chairman--Gabriel Duque of Colombia--that he act upon this report, share it with the member states, and make it publically available. We also call upon our State Department to follow up on this, and to be persistent in pushing for reform, transparency and accountability of WIPO. This week's hearing will have reverberations beyond WIPO, for there appears to be a culture of corruption at many international organizations, not only WIPO. We hear revelations, for example, about FIFA and world soccer, and how the serpent of corruption wheedles its way even into the world of sport, undermining the nobility of athletic competition. We hear of the sexual exploitation of minors occurring in UN peacekeeping missions--I chaired three hearings on that and traveled to DR Congo to investigate--transforming ostensible emissaries of mercy into envoys of exploitation, and supposed places of refuge maw pits of misery. The hearing I held this week is the first in what we hope to be a series of hearings this Congress holds to focus on the need for reform at the United Nations and its institutions, with our next in the series being on UN Peacekeepers and the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse. We believe by shining a light, we can help victims and help end corruption, bringing healing and true reform. Organizations such as WIPO are too important to be abandoned. It is essential that we conduct vigorous oversight and demand accountability to help refocus this organization on fulfilling its vital mission. Finally, I would like to thank my co-chairs from the co-sponsoring subcommittees, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Matt Salmon, and our various ranking members, for joining me at the hearing earlier this week. Rep. Ros-Lehtinen in particular has been dogged in pursuing this issue over many years now, and deserves praise for first addressing the issue of corruption at WIPO. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E245] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ESTABLISHING ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION: ILLICIT TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS, WHISTLEBLOWING, AND REFORM ______ HON.

The hearing was timely as well as topical, as there has been an internal investigation of WIPO by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services into the allegations of wrongdoing. The results of this investigation are currently before the chairman of WIPO's General Assembly--this is a General Assembly of member states, including the United States, based in Geneva. It is incumbent upon the General Assembly chairman--Gabriel Duque of Colombia--that he act upon this report, share it with the member states, and make it publically available. We also call upon our State Department to follow up on this, and to be persistent in pushing for reform, transparency and accountability of WIPO. This week's hearing will have reverberations beyond WIPO, for there appears to be a culture of corruption at many international organizations, not only WIPO. We hear revelations, for example, about FIFA and world soccer, and how the serpent of corruption wheedles its way even into the world of sport, undermining the nobility of athletic competition. We hear of the sexual exploitation of minors occurring in UN peacekeeping missions--I chaired three hearings on that and traveled to DR Congo to investigate--transforming ostensible emissaries of mercy into envoys of exploitation, and supposed places of refuge maw pits of misery. The hearing I held this week is the first in what we hope to be a series of hearings this Congress holds to focus on the need for reform at the United Nations and its institutions, with our next in the series being on UN Peacekeepers and the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse. We believe by shining a light, we can help victims and help end corruption, bringing healing and true reform. Organizations such as WIPO are too important to be abandoned. It is essential that we conduct vigorous oversight and demand accountability to help refocus this organization on fulfilling its vital mission. Finally, I would like to thank my co-chairs from the co-sponsoring subcommittees, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Matt Salmon, and our various ranking members, for joining me at the hearing earlier this week. Rep. Ros-Lehtinen in particular has been dogged in pursuing this issue over many years now, and deserves praise for first addressing the issue of corruption at WIPO. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E245] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ESTABLISHING ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION: ILLICIT TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS, WHISTLEBLOWING, AND REFORM ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, February 29, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, a hearing I held earlier this week put a spotlight on an organization that is a critical component of a global system of intellectual property and patent protection, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO. It is an organization that, unfortunately, appears to have lost its way under its current Director General, Francis Gurry, and is in need of major reform. We heard from whistleblowers who related how they uncovered illicit transfers of technology to rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran, and how WIPO under Director General Gurry, unbeknownst to member States, cut deals with China and Russia to open offices in those countries, potentially putting our intellectual property at risk. The hearing was about national security as much as the importance of sound governance and oversight. China, for example, has a notoriously bad record on protecting intellectual property rights--WIPO ought to be part of the solution. You may know that I serve as Chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China; Senator Marco Rubio is co-chair. Ominously, the Commission's latest annual report released last October concluded that human rights violations had significantly worsened and were broader in scope than at any other time since the Commission was established in 2002. Last week I travelled to China on a mission to promote human rights, the rule of law and democracy, which of course includes intellectual property rights. In China I not only met and argued with government leaders, but I had the privilege of writing and delivering a keynote address to students and faculty at New York University-Shanghai. Hopes in the 90's that China would eventually and inevitably matriculate from a dictatorship to democracy haven't even come close to materializing. According to the Commission's report, U.S. companies faced significant difficulties related to intellectual property rights in China. And China is not the only place where these problems persist. Two of our witnesses, Jim Pooley and Miranda Brown, recounted what they saw at WIPO, and what happened when they sought to bring to light what they saw. It is not a pretty story. It is the personal aspect of governance and oversight that I want to emphasize, because at its heart the story we heard is a human drama, about brave individuals who at great personal cost to themselves and their comfort saw wrongdoing and decided to do something about it. The hearing was timely as well as topical, as there has been an internal investigation of WIPO by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services into the allegations of wrongdoing.

Sadly, George passed away on February 26, 2016. His funeral service will be held today, February 29, 2016 at St. Paul United Methodist Church in Columbus, Georgia. George William Jeter was born March 29, 1935, in Montgomery, Alabama. He graduated from Coffee County High School in Enterprise, Alabama in 1953 and earned his Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from the University of Alabama in 1957. After graduation, he went on to serve his country with distinction as an army officer from 1957-59, serving as a Weapons Instructor. George was also an Internal Revenue Agent and Field Audit Supervisor from 1959-1969. He served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at AFLAC, Inc. and affiliates from 1969-86. He played a tremendous role in helping to grow the company in its early days and helped to launch the business in Japan, where AFLAC now does almost 75 percent of its business. Following his retirement from AFLAC, George continued to serve as a consultant to the company until his passing. George loved collecting guns, samurai swords, and Japanese Art. Moreover, he also loved people and Columbus.

He also established the George W. Jeter Foundation so that he could find other ways to support the causes that he championed throughout his life. It has been said that ``The true person of success is not the person that climbs the ladder of this life with two hands, but climbs the ladder of this life with one hand and reaches back with the other.'' George William Jeter was always reaching back to help others to reach their full potential. Our country and humankind are better because he travelled this way. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 730,000 people of the Second Congressional District in extending condolences to his wife, Jo, their four children and two grandchildren and our gratitude for his life of service to humanity. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E245-E246] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF GEORGE W.

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Monday, February 29, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to urge the Senate Republicans to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee. It is disappointing that our democratic process is being so unduly hindered by Senate Republicans who refuse to carry out their basic duties clearly laid out for them in the Constitution. The Constitution clearly informs us that the President has the power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to nominate a successor for open seats in the Supreme Court. The message for Senate Republicans is simple--let the President do his job. It is time to put aside partisan issues and get back to the basics of governing. In previous years, Supreme Court nominations have been at least considered during an election year; six times in our U.S. history to be exact. So I ask, why change now? If Senate Republicans fail to consider the President's Supreme Court nominee during the current election year, this will be the first time in U.S. history that our Supreme Court will have a vacancy for well over a year. There is simply no legitimate rationale for not giving consideration to the President's nominee once announced. There is an ample amount of time available for the Senate to consider the President's nominee. The Supreme Court vacancy is a priority that deserves an unbiased hearing and timely vote. Justice and democracy are at stake and there is no time for this kind of divisiveness. Republican Senators have a constitutional obligation to put away partisan issues and fill this vacancy. Senate Republicans, I strongly urge you to fulfil your constitutional duty and consider President Obama's nominee for Supreme Court Justice. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E247] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SENATE REPUBLICAN SUPPORT OF OBAMA'S SUPREME COURT NOMINATION ______ HON.

BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Monday, February 29, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of an outstanding member of the East Bay community, Sister Dorothy Cook. We honor her life of service and spiritual devotion, and recognize the teachings she has given to our community. Born in 1934 in Prescott, Arkansas, Sister Dorothy Cook has been a lifelong servant and messenger of the Lord's word. She attended Sunday school every weekend at Sweet Home Baptist Church, building her relationship with God and His word. Sister Cook relocated to San Francisco in 1947, where she then attended San Francisco City College and San Francisco State University. Sister Cook's exemplary ministry promotes faith, family values, and the presence of God in every aspect of life. She seeks to bring religion back into the fabric of our society. Ministry is the foundation and sole mission of Sister Cook's work. Whether building a gospel house or preparing videos, Sister Cook involved many believers in her endeavors. Ministry can be found anywhere, as Sister Cook has shown us, with many of these projects helping to train others to follow the path of their Lord. Her patience is a testament to the endurance of service and devotion to God. She is selfless and unwavering in her motivation to do God's work. Furthermore, Sister Cook has produced numerous literary works which have impacted our local youth and church community. Sister Dorothy Cook has also had a profound impact on the most vulnerable in our community, helping lead many voices toward the word of God by offering opportunity and appreciation to those who have never had such chances in their life. Her dedication to community is unrivaled and fueled by the word of God. Today, California's 13th Congressional District salutes the life of an exemplary individual and devoted community member, Sister Dorothy Cook. I join all of Sister Dorothy Cook's loved ones in wishing her continued happiness and success in life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E246] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SISTER DOROTHY COOK ______ HON.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, February 29, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the backbone of the court system, courtroom reporters make sure that the system works efficiently. Tasked with keeping complete, accurate and secure records, courtroom reporters handle verbatim documentation of criminal, civil or other court proceedings. These individuals are highly skilled and trained in court reporting, which usually involves stenography. Reporting for the courts involves taking records of court proceedings, depositions, and administrative hearings, among other things. They record everything that is being said in the courtroom by judges, witnesses, attorneys or other parties, as well as gestures and emotional reactions that accompany any statements. While taking shorthand notes, they must accurately capture the spoken word. This does not mean paraphrasing or capturing every other word. Reporters must capture each word verbatim, with correct spelling and punctuation, despite the speed in which individuals are talking. After the hearing is over, they then must transcribe their notes into a readable, workable format for the public record. Sometimes, a court reporter's work benefits those with special needs, such as the deaf or hard of hearing. Court reporters can even provide closed captioning or a real-time translation of spoken words. During my 22 years as a judge in Texas, I had many court reporters who capably kept records of every word said in the courtroom. Being a court reporter is no easy feat, stressors come from every direction including security issues and daily deadlines. In the House of Representatives, we have clerks who help us and our staff every day. These individuals serve as the congressional stenographers, working diligently, day in and day out. These individuals take notes on congressional hearings and floor debate, speeches and statements. They then work extremely fast to enter all the statements into the Congressional Record. Every single entry must be completely correct. Each statement made goes on the record in congressional history. These individuals' work ensures that history is written correctly. Without their diligence we would not be able to do our jobs as efficiently. These highly trained and talented men and women work tenaciously to record correctly the proceedings of the court system as well as Congress. Court reporters and floor clerks are truly a vital asset to judges and Members of Congress. We thank them for getting the words right. And that's just the way it is.

Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to recognize the passing of Mr. Bennett Richard ``Ben'' Houston on February 26th, 2016. Mr. Houston was a beloved and nationally distinguished leader within the livestock industry. Mr. Houston received many distinct honors throughout his lifetime. He founded the Aristocrat Angus Ranch in 1966, with his wife Nita, where they raised their family. In 1992, Aristocrat Angus Ranch flew Angus seed stock and beef cattle genetics to the Ukraine, establishing them as a leader in the cattle industry. In addition, Mr. Houston participated in many notable committees and associations. He was elected to the Executive Committee of the Western Stock Show in 1976. He went on to be President in 1985, and ultimately Chairman of the Board in 1999. He was inducted into the Angus Heritage Foundation, served as a member of the American Angus Association for over 50 years, served as President of the Colorado Cattle Feeders, and was presented with the CSU Leadership in Agriculture Award. Mr. Houston was involved with a number of other organizations, where his limitless knowledge and service will always be remembered. It is the hard work Mr. Houston embodied throughout his life that makes America exceptional. He has shown true leadership in his industry and community. I extend my deepest sympathies to Mr. Houston's family and friends. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Mr. Bennett Richard ``Ben'' Houston for his commitment to family, community, and the livestock industry. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E247] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BENNETT RICHARD ``BEN'' HOUSTON ______ HON.

In 1992, Aristocrat Angus Ranch flew Angus seed stock and beef cattle genetics to the Ukraine, establishing them as a leader in the cattle industry. In addition, Mr. Houston participated in many notable committees and associations. He was elected to the Executive Committee of the Western Stock Show in 1976. He went on to be President in 1985, and ultimately Chairman of the Board in 1999. He was inducted into the Angus Heritage Foundation, served as a member of the American Angus Association for over 50 years, served as President of the Colorado Cattle Feeders, and was presented with the CSU Leadership in Agriculture Award. Mr. Houston was involved with a number of other organizations, where his limitless knowledge and service will always be remembered. It is the hard work Mr. Houston embodied throughout his life that makes America exceptional. He has shown true leadership in his industry and community.

MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Monday, February 29, 2016 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the month of February 2016 comes to a close to recognize a milestone anniversary in the life of Toledo's Indiana Avenue Baptist Church. This month the congregation has been celebrating its 70th anniversary with a series of special gatherings. I was privileged to join the congregation yesterday. Founded by Reverend M. J. Stephenson in February 1946, the congregation has been shepherded by Reverend John Roberts for more than half a century. Pastor Roberts, in fact, was part of the organizational meeting of the church. Thus, this long standing beacon in our city has been blessed with a continuity of leadership since its beginnings. Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church's first services in its building were held in its lower level in 1948. An upper level was added twenty years later and since 1980 services have been held in its newer sanctuary. In 1989 a fellowship hall was added which has served the congregation very well, with special focus on activities for youth. The hall bears the name of founding Pastor Stephenson and longtime Pastor Roberts. Starting with less than 100 members, the congregation of Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church has served over 7,000 people through its seven decades and currently serves about 2,000 people. An anchor in our community, the church serves its faithful while ministering to the needs of its neighbors. One of the wonderful traditions at the church is the Interfaith Mass Choir. The choir's beautiful blend of voices soar in faith-filled praise, lifting up in joy those it reaches through song. Psalms Chapter 18 Verse 2 tells us, ``The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.'' Through the days of its ``threescore and ten'' years, the shepherds and flock of Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church have lived this truth as their lives have given testament to Jesus' message of love which ``bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.'' (1 Corinthians 13:7) ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E247] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING 70 YEARS OF INDIANA AVENUE MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, Congressman Dave Brat and I submit these remarks to commemorate the life of John Stewart Bryan who passed away January 23, 2016 at the age of 77. During Mr. Bryan's more than 50-year career, he worked as a newspaper journalist, served as publisher of four newspapers, the Richmond Times- Dispatch, Richmond News Leader, The Tampa Tribune, and The Tampa Times, and later became the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive of Media General. Mr. Bryan proudly and accurately referred to himself as a ``newspaperman.'' J. Stewart Bryan III was born on May 4, 1938 in Richmond. A Virginian through and through, he attended St. Christopher's School in Richmond, the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, and the University of Virginia. Afterwards, he served our country as an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. Mr. Bryan's accolades were numerous and well deserved. He was awarded honorary doctor of humane letters degrees from Hampden-Sydney College, Emory & Henry College, College of William & Mary, and Randolph-Macon College, and he was inducted as a laureate of the Virginia Communications Hall of Fame and the Richmond Business Hall of Fame. He also received the outstanding service award of the Florida Press Association, the lifetime achievement award of the Virginia Press Association, the Frank Mayborn Leadership Award of the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association, the George Mason Award for significant contributions to the advancement of journalism in Virginia from the Society of Professional Journalists, Virginia Pro Chapter (SPJVA), and the medal of honor of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Moreover, he was well known for supporting, and when necessary staunchly defending, his staff, and he fought steadfastly for the freedom of press. But perhaps, his career and his passion are best summed up by the Richmond Times-Dispatch in an editorial after his passing: ``Stewart Bryan's heart pumped ink. He devoted his life to newspapers. A life devoted to print is a life devoted to time and place. Bryan loved Richmond. He considered The Times-Dispatch and News Leader vehicles of public service. When the press does its job, it improves its surroundings. Bryan may have belonged to a newspaper family but he answered a vocation's call.'' He is survived by his wife, Lisa-Margaret ``Lissy'' Stevenson Bryan: his daughters, Elizabeth Talbott Bryan Maxey ``Talbott'', and Anna Saulsbury Bryan (Stephen) Sullivan. Five grandchildren: Tennant and Alice Maxey, and Pryor, Stewart, and Harriett Sullivan. Two sisters: Mary Tennant Bryan Perkins and Florence Talbott Bryan Fowlkes. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the entire Bryan family.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, February 29, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today is the last day of Black History Month, a time when the nation pauses to remember the contributions of African American men and women that have enriched the fabric of our nation. That is why it is fitting and proper that we take a moment to recount and appreciate the extraordinary accomplishments of one of the singular figures in American history: President Barack Obama. Mr. Speaker, those of us who were there remember well that the morning of January 20, 2009 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, DC. But it was nothing compared to the chill wind blowing through the American economy and body politic. The nation was facing economic challenges unseen since the Great Depression: Americans were losing their jobs at a frightening rate of 800,000 per month; the national unemployment rate had risen to 7.8 percent and would continue to climb until reaching its peak of 10.0 percent in October 2009. For African Americans, the numbers were much grimmer, a jobless rate of 13.5 percent in January 2009 which would grow to 16.5 percent by the end of the year. And on top of this, tens of thousands of American families each month were losing their health insurance and their homes to foreclosure. The United States was still bogged down in the quagmire that was the Iraq War and young people by the thousands were being forced to defer or drop out of college because of lack of financial aid. And the average price of gas exceeded $4 per gallon. It was against this backdrop that I watched from the inaugural platform as Barack Obama, surrounded by his radiant and beautiful wife, Michelle, and their two adorable daughters, rose to take the oath of office. After being sworn in as the nation's 44th President of the United States, President Obama reassured an anxious but hopeful nation, saying: Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this America: They will be met. Watching Barack Obama address the nation that day, spectators in attendance and viewers across the country and around the world understood they were witnessing a historic president, the first African American ever to hold the nation's highest office. But more than being a historic president, Barack Obama's actions and leadership over the ensuing seven years would demonstrate his would be a consequential presidency that changed America for the better. His first and most pressing task was to rescue an economy on the brink of collapse. Working with the Democratic-controlled Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was passed, which created 3.7 million jobs and saved the jobs of millions of teachers, firefighters, police officers, and social service providers. The Recovery Act also cut taxes for working families, extended unemployment insurance, and expanded the Earned Income and Child tax credits, which disproportionately benefit African American families. Seven years later the verdict is in on the economic plan put in place by President Obama and the Democratic Congress. The Recovery Act ended the Great Recession, transformed the economy from one hemorrhaging jobs to one that has created over 16 [[Page E249]] million new jobs over a record 71 consecutive months. The national unemployment rate has dipped under 5% for the first time since President Clinton left office, the deficit has been cut by 71%, and the Dow Jones stock market index topped 18,000 in 2015, an increase of 177% over where it stood the day President Obama took office. And, as an added benefit, the average price of gasoline has been reduced from more than $4.11 per gallon to $1.80, the lowest price since before the tragedy of September 11. These last seven years also effected policy changes in the areas of criminal justice reform, health and education, national security, and foreign affairs. A partial listing of these achievements is substantial, impressive, and varied. President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act in August 2010, which reduces the disparity in the amounts of powder cocaine and crack cocaine required for the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences and eliminates the mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine. In July 2015, President Obama became the first president ever to tour a federal prison when he visited the El Reno Federal Correctional Institution outside of Oklahoma City. President Obama launched the Smart on Crime initiative through which the Department of Justice modified its charging policies for certain federal low-level drug-related offenses, improved diversion and re- entry policies, and strengthened protections for the most vulnerable. President Obama established Smart on Juvenile Justice grant program to expand the use of effective community-based alternatives to youth detention and launched the Second Chance Pell Pilot Program for Incarcerated Individuals to test new models to allow incarcerated Americans to receive Pell Grants and pursue the postsecondary education with the goal of helping them get jobs, support their families, and turn their lives around. President Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management to take action where it can to ``ban the box'' by modifying its rules to delay inquiries into criminal history until later in the hiring process and called on Congress to enact legislation ``banning the box'' on job applications in the private sector. President Obama increased the use of body-worn cameras through $20 million in grants to state and local law enforcement. President Obama issued an Executive Order to increase the capacity of VA mental-health programs by hiring 1,600 more mental-health professionals and expanding the capacity of the Veterans Crisis Line. President Obama provided nearly $60 billion in benefit payments under the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill to over 1.5 million individuals and relaxed the evidence requirements for veterans seeking disability pay for post- traumatic stress disorder with the Department of Veterans Affairs. President Obama acted to reduce gun violence by issuing executive orders requiring background checks for people trying to buy some of the most dangerous weapons and other items through a trust or corporation and an overhaul of the background check system to make it more efficient and effective. President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act passed by the Democratic Congress which has provided access to quality, affordable health insurance to nearly 20 million previously uninsured Americans. President Obama launched the ``My Brother's Keeper'' Initiative in 2014 to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. In October 2009, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, historic legislation extending coverage of federal hate-crime law to include attacks based on the victim's race, religion, nationality, or actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. President Obama established the new Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy for young undocumented people who came to the U.S. as children in an effort to better focus enforcement resources. President Obama expanded opportunity for America's children by strengthening Head Start. President Obama made college more affordable by increasing Pell grants, keeping interest rates on student loans low, and helping students manageably repay their loans. President Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act, which made historic investments in improved child nutrition and health for the 31 million children who rely on school meals and updated science-based school meal standards to increase fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy, while reducing fats and sodium. In December 2010, the Congress passed and President Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 into law, allowing gay men and women to serve openly and with integrity in the U.S. military. President Obama also made history by appointing two women to the U.S. Supreme Court, including the first Hispanic American to serve on the Court. President Obama appointed the first African American man and woman to serve as Attorney General and the first woman to Chair the Federal Reserve Board. In the area of foreign affairs and national security, President Obama ended the Iraq War, assembled and led an international coalition to impose sanctions so crippling on Iran that it was forced to the negotiating table that yielded the Iran Nuclear Agreement that prevents Iran from ever attaining a nuclear weapon. And of course, as the world knows, because of President Obama's leadership, General Motors is alive and Osama Bin Laden is dead. For seven years, President Barack Obama has represented our country with grace, integrity, honor, and distinction. He has provided consolation, hope, and healing in the face of unspeakable tragedies such as the massacre of innocent children at Sandy Hook, worshippers at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, spectators at the Boston Marathon, and mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado and Tucson, Arizona. He expressed and symbolized our joy and pride in the progress made over the last half century--and the distance we still have to travel-- when he marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and addressed the multitude from the spot on the steps where the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. shared his dream for America's future. So as President Obama serves the final year of his presidency, it is clear beyond doubt that he kept the promise he made to the nation seven years ago on that cold day in January when he said: Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. . . . But know this America: They will be met. They were more than just met; under his leadership they were overcome with amazing grace. And because of President Barack Obama, today the United States is stronger, more prosperous, and better positioned than ever to win the future. As a presidential candidate in 2008, then Senator Obama promised the America people ``change you can believe in.'' In office, President Obama made good on that promise, delivering positive change that the American people can see and feel. And that is what makes his one of the most consequential presidencies in American history. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E248-E249] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SEVEN YEARS OF CHANGE THAT YOU CAN SEE AND FEEL ______ HON.

The United States was still bogged down in the quagmire that was the Iraq War and young people by the thousands were being forced to defer or drop out of college because of lack of financial aid. And the average price of gas exceeded $4 per gallon. It was against this backdrop that I watched from the inaugural platform as Barack Obama, surrounded by his radiant and beautiful wife, Michelle, and their two adorable daughters, rose to take the oath of office. After being sworn in as the nation's 44th President of the United States, President Obama reassured an anxious but hopeful nation, saying: Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this America: They will be met. Watching Barack Obama address the nation that day, spectators in attendance and viewers across the country and around the world understood they were witnessing a historic president, the first African American ever to hold the nation's highest office. But more than being a historic president, Barack Obama's actions and leadership over the ensuing seven years would demonstrate his would be a consequential presidency that changed America for the better. His first and most pressing task was to rescue an economy on the brink of collapse. Working with the Democratic-controlled Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was passed, which created 3.7 million jobs and saved the jobs of millions of teachers, firefighters, police officers, and social service providers. The Recovery Act also cut taxes for working families, extended unemployment insurance, and expanded the Earned Income and Child tax credits, which disproportionately benefit African American families. Seven years later the verdict is in on the economic plan put in place by President Obama and the Democratic Congress. The Recovery Act ended the Great Recession, transformed the economy from one hemorrhaging jobs to one that has created over 16 [[Page E249]] million new jobs over a record 71 consecutive months. The national unemployment rate has dipped under 5% for the first time since President Clinton left office, the deficit has been cut by 71%, and the Dow Jones stock market index topped 18,000 in 2015, an increase of 177% over where it stood the day President Obama took office. And, as an added benefit, the average price of gasoline has been reduced from more than $4.11 per gallon to $1.80, the lowest price since before the tragedy of September 11. These last seven years also effected policy changes in the areas of criminal justice reform, health and education, national security, and foreign affairs. A partial listing of these achievements is substantial, impressive, and varied. President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act in August 2010, which reduces the disparity in the amounts of powder cocaine and crack cocaine required for the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences and eliminates the mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine. In July 2015, President Obama became the first president ever to tour a federal prison when he visited the El Reno Federal Correctional Institution outside of Oklahoma City. President Obama launched the Smart on Crime initiative through which the Department of Justice modified its charging policies for certain federal low-level drug-related offenses, improved diversion and re- entry policies, and strengthened protections for the most vulnerable. President Obama established Smart on Juvenile Justice grant program to expand the use of effective community-based alternatives to youth detention and launched the Second Chance Pell Pilot Program for Incarcerated Individuals to test new models to allow incarcerated Americans to receive Pell Grants and pursue the postsecondary education with the goal of helping them get jobs, support their families, and turn their lives around. President Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management to take action where it can to ``ban the box'' by modifying its rules to delay inquiries into criminal history until later in the hiring process and called on Congress to enact legislation ``banning the box'' on job applications in the private sector. President Obama increased the use of body-worn cameras through $20 million in grants to state and local law enforcement. President Obama issued an Executive Order to increase the capacity of VA mental-health programs by hiring 1,600 more mental-health professionals and expanding the capacity of the Veterans Crisis Line. President Obama provided nearly $60 billion in benefit payments under the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill to over 1.5 million individuals and relaxed the evidence requirements for veterans seeking disability pay for post- traumatic stress disorder with the Department of Veterans Affairs. President Obama acted to reduce gun violence by issuing executive orders requiring background checks for people trying to buy some of the most dangerous weapons and other items through a trust or corporation and an overhaul of the background check system to make it more efficient and effective. President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act passed by the Democratic Congress which has provided access to quality, affordable health insurance to nearly 20 million previously uninsured Americans. President Obama launched the ``My Brother's Keeper'' Initiative in 2014 to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. In October 2009, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, historic legislation extending coverage of federal hate-crime law to include attacks based on the victim's race, religion, nationality, or actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. President Obama established the new Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy for young undocumented people who came to the U.S. as children in an effort to better focus enforcement resources. President Obama expanded opportunity for America's children by strengthening Head Start. President Obama made college more affordable by increasing Pell grants, keeping interest rates on student loans low, and helping students manageably repay their loans. President Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act, which made historic investments in improved child nutrition and health for the 31 million children who rely on school meals and updated science-based school meal standards to increase fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy, while reducing fats and sodium. In December 2010, the Congress passed and President Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 into law, allowing gay men and women to serve openly and with integrity in the U.S. military. President Obama also made history by appointing two women to the U.S. Supreme Court, including the first Hispanic American to serve on the Court. President Obama appointed the first African American man and woman to serve as Attorney General and the first woman to Chair the Federal Reserve Board. In the area of foreign affairs and national security, President Obama ended the Iraq War, assembled and led an international coalition to impose sanctions so crippling on Iran that it was forced to the negotiating table that yielded the Iran Nuclear Agreement that prevents Iran from ever attaining a nuclear weapon. And of course, as the world knows, because of President Obama's leadership, General Motors is alive and Osama Bin Laden is dead. For seven years, President Barack Obama has represented our country with grace, integrity, honor, and distinction. He has provided consolation, hope, and healing in the face of unspeakable tragedies such as the massacre of innocent children at Sandy Hook, worshippers at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, spectators at the Boston Marathon, and mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado and Tucson, Arizona. He expressed and symbolized our joy and pride in the progress made over the last half century--and the distance we still have to travel-- when he marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and addressed the multitude from the spot on the steps where the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. shared his dream for America's future. So as President Obama serves the final year of his presidency, it is clear beyond doubt that he kept the promise he made to the nation seven years ago on that cold day in January when he said: Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. . . . But know this America: They will be met. They were more than just met; under his leadership they were overcome with amazing grace. And because of President Barack Obama, today the United States is stronger, more prosperous, and better positioned than ever to win the future. As a presidential candidate in 2008, then Senator Obama promised the America people ``change you can believe in.'' In office, President Obama made good on that promise, delivering positive change that the American people can see and feel. And that is what makes his one of the most consequential presidencies in American history. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 32 (Monday, February 29, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E248-E249] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SEVEN YEARS OF CHANGE THAT YOU CAN SEE AND FEEL ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, February 29, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today is the last day of Black History Month, a time when the nation pauses to remember the contributions of African American men and women that have enriched the fabric of our nation. That is why it is fitting and proper that we take a moment to recount and appreciate the extraordinary accomplishments of one of the singular figures in American history: President Barack Obama. Mr. Speaker, those of us who were there remember well that the morning of January 20, 2009 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, DC. But it was nothing compared to the chill wind blowing through the American economy and body politic. The nation was facing economic challenges unseen since the Great Depression: Americans were losing their jobs at a frightening rate of 800,000 per month; the national unemployment rate had risen to 7.8 percent and would continue to climb until reaching its peak of 10.0 percent in October 2009. For African Americans, the numbers were much grimmer, a jobless rate of 13.5 percent in January 2009 which would grow to 16.5 percent by the end of the year. And on top of this, tens of thousands of American families each month were losing their health insurance and their homes to foreclosure.
