Madam President, Nancy Reagan was one of the most powerful First Ladies in recent memory. For instance, sometimes she spoke out on issues like substance abuse, but more often Nancy wielded her power with calm confidence and quiet steel. It was an attitude that helped guide Nancy through so many challenges in her own life: getting an acting career off the ground, leaving it to raise a family, riding the ups and downs of a life in politics, watching her husband brave the bullet of a would-be assassin or face the threat of cancer, and then confront the same reality herself. Nancy Reagan may have been a star in Hollywood and a force in the rough-and-tumble of Washington, but it was the challenges to come that would reveal her true strength. In 1994, former President Reagan addressed a letter to his fellow Americans. He said: ``I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life.'' Nancy shared her very personal experience with that cold and cruel disease, telling Americans of the ``terrible pain and loneliness'' that accompanied Alzheimer's ``very long goodbye,'' but she never gave in or gave up. Nancy was strong for her husband, she was a rock for her family, and she was an example for a nation that looked to her for inspiration. One day, after many long and difficult years, Ronald Reagan opened his eyes and looked at Nancy. ``He hadn't done that in well over a month,'' she recalled. ``But he looked at me and closed his eyes. And went. And that was a wonderful gift.'' We felt Nancy's immense pain when she leaned over his casket, kissed it, and mouthed her tearful farewell. From ``Morning in America'' to a sunset in Simi Valley, the Reagan love story was classic Hollywood, but it was also unmistakably human. Nancy said her life had only really begun after she met Ronald Reagan. Now she joins her best friend to dance together once more. We in the Senate join our Nation in mourning the loss of Nancy Reagan. We offer every condolence to the family members left behind. Let us remember the rest of what President Reagan wrote to the Nation in 1994. ``I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life,'' is what he wrote then, but--but--``I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1299] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING NANCY REAGAN Mr. McCONNELL.

It was an attitude that helped guide Nancy through so many challenges in her own life: getting an acting career off the ground, leaving it to raise a family, riding the ups and downs of a life in politics, watching her husband brave the bullet of a would-be assassin or face the threat of cancer, and then confront the same reality herself. Nancy Reagan may have been a star in Hollywood and a force in the rough-and-tumble of Washington, but it was the challenges to come that would reveal her true strength. In 1994, former President Reagan addressed a letter to his fellow Americans. He said: ``I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life.'' Nancy shared her very personal experience with that cold and cruel disease, telling Americans of the ``terrible pain and loneliness'' that accompanied Alzheimer's ``very long goodbye,'' but she never gave in or gave up. Nancy was strong for her husband, she was a rock for her family, and she was an example for a nation that looked to her for inspiration. One day, after many long and difficult years, Ronald Reagan opened his eyes and looked at Nancy. ``He hadn't done that in well over a month,'' she recalled. ``But he looked at me and closed his eyes. And went. And that was a wonderful gift.'' We felt Nancy's immense pain when she leaned over his casket, kissed it, and mouthed her tearful farewell. From ``Morning in America'' to a sunset in Simi Valley, the Reagan love story was classic Hollywood, but it was also unmistakably human. Nancy said her life had only really begun after she met Ronald Reagan. Now she joins her best friend to dance together once more. We in the Senate join our Nation in mourning the loss of Nancy Reagan. We offer every condolence to the family members left behind. Let us remember the rest of what President Reagan wrote to the Nation in 1994. ``I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life,'' is what he wrote then, but--but--``I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead.'' ____________________",package_114_149.csv,2514,2514,2580,"[congressional record volume 162, number 36 (monday, march 7, 2016)] [senate] [page s1299] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] remembering nancy reagan mr. mcconnell. madam president, nancy reagan was one of the most powerful first ladies in recent memory. for instance, sometimes she spoke out on issues like substance abuse, but more often nancy wielded her power with calm confidence and quiet steel. it was an attitude that helped guide nancy through so many challenges in her own life: getting an acting career off the ground, leaving it to raise a family, riding the ups and downs of a life in politics, watching her husband brave the bullet of a would-be assassin or face the threat of cancer, and then confront the same reality herself. nancy reagan may have been a star in hollywood and a force in the rough-and-tumble of washington, but it was the challenges to come that would reveal her true strength. in 1994, former president reagan addressed a letter to his fellow americans. he said: ``i now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life.'' nancy shared her very personal experience with that cold and cruel disease, telling americans of the ``terrible pain and loneliness'' that accompanied alzheimer's ``very long goodbye,'' but she never gave in or gave up. nancy was strong for her husband, she was a rock for her family, and she was an example for a nation that looked to her for inspiration. one day, after many long and difficult years, ronald reagan opened his eyes and looked at nancy. ``he hadn't done that in well over a month,'' she recalled. ``but he looked at me and closed his eyes. and went. and that was a wonderful gift.'' we felt nancy's immense pain when she leaned over his casket, kissed it, and mouthed her tearful farewell. from ``morning in america'' to a sunset in simi valley, the reagan love story was classic hollywood, but it was also unmistakably human. nancy said her life had only really begun after she met ronald reagan. now she joins her best friend to dance together once more. we in the senate join our nation in mourning the loss of nancy reagan. we offer every condolence to the family members left behind. let us remember the rest of what president reagan wrote to the nation in 1994. ``i now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life,'' is what he wrote then, but--but--``i know that for america there will always be a bright dawn ahead.'' ____________________",2514

We can do so by advancing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Just a few months ago, we appropriated $400 million to opioid- specific programs. We are glad that all of those funds remain available to be spent today, and now we can pass comprehensive, bipartisan legislation that will help build upon the progress being made in this fight. This CARA bill would expand education and prevention. It would bolster law enforcement efforts. It would improve treatment initiatives. This bill has also received broad bipartisan backing and the support of nearly 130 groups dedicated to ending this crisis. We appreciate the work of the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, who worked to move this bill swiftly out of the Judiciary Committee. We thank Senator Portman, Senator Ayotte, along with the junior Senator from Rhode Island and the senior Senator from Minnesota, for all the work they have done to advance CARA.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgS1300-4,CREC-2016-03-07,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1300] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID. Madam President, from the Des Moines Register. Two former Lieutenant Governors of the State of Iowa--and I am sure the Acting President pro tempore knows both of them, one a Democrat and one a Republican--here is what they said, among other things: ``This isn't the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.'' Again, I repeat, this is two Iowans, former Lieutenant Governors Joy Corning, a Republican, and Sally Pederson, a Democrat. Last week former Lieutenant Governors Corning and Pederson coauthored an op-ed in the Des Moines Register criticizing the senior Senator from Iowa for abdicating his constitutional duties by blocking consideration of President Obama's Supreme Court nomination. The op-ed reads, among other things: Iowans are known for being hard workers, and we appreciate that quality in our elected officials. We wake up every day, ready to do our part, and get the job done. We are also politically astute, understand the U.S. Constitution, and know when an elected official is more eager to find excuses than create solutions. Unfortunately, Sen. Chuck Grassley is refusing to do his job as described in Article 2 of our Constitution, giving ``advice and consent'' on the president's upcoming nomination to the Supreme Court. Grassley is threatening to use his powerful post as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to block a hearing on any nominee, regardless of how well qualified he or she is. His recent column and public statements regarding the vacancy on the Supreme Court are troubling and harmful to our courts. Moreover, this isn't the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew. ``This isn't the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.'' I agree with these Iowans. This isn't the Senator I have come to know over the last three decades. The Senator I knew would not cede the independence of the powerful Judiciary Committee he has served on for many decades to the Republican leader. The Senator I knew would not ignore his constitutional duties for the sake of election-year politics, but for whatever reason the Senator from Iowa made a fateful decision in the hours after Justice Antonin Scalia's death. He is allowing himself and his committee to be manipulated by the Republican leader for narrow, partisan warfare. He is taking his orders from the Republican leader and, sadly, Donald Trump. When asked about this issue, Donald Trump's words were three: delay, delay, delay. Senator Grassley must have been listening. The people of Iowa, without question, are displeased with their Senator. The Des Moines Register quoted one of Senator Grassley's disappointed supporters as follows: He seems to be doing what other people are saying, not what he thinks is best. That has really colored my opinion of him in the past week. Another Iowan who supports the Senator told the newspaper: I think he's making a bad mistake. . . . It's purely a political party play, and there isn't any space for that in this situation. Now, as each day passes, the senior Senator from Iowa is trying desperately to justify his blind loyalty to the Republican leader and to Donald Trump. Senator Grassley is grasping for a rationale--any rationale--that will excuse him for not doing his job. That desperation is now taking Senator Grassley down a very dark path. Last Thursday, the senior Senator from Iowa addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, which took place here in Washington. In his speech to them, here is what Senator Grassley said: ``I feel it's about time that we have a national debate on the Supreme Court and how it fits in with our constitutional system of government.'' The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is suggesting that we reevaluate the Founding Fathers' work, reevaluate the Constitution of the United States, and change the Constitution of the United States. Why is Senator Grassley debating what the Constitution makes clear? The Senate must provide its advice and consent on nominees appointed by the President to the Supreme Court. Think of the irony. Justice Scalia was a strict constitutionalist. Yet now, in the weeks following his death, Senator Grassley wants to throw out the Constitution just because President Obama gets to pick Scalia's replacement. The former Senator from Iowa Tom Harkin said it best yesterday. This appeared in the Des Moines Register: ``The position taken now by the majority leader and majority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee is simply astounding, and not in keeping with a `strict,' or even `loose,' construction of the Constitution.'' The Constitution isn't some ball you pick up and take home just because you are still mad that Barack Obama is the President. If Senator Grassley and Republicans find themselves on the wrong side of the Constitution, it is their policies that should change, not our Nation's founding document, the Constitution of the United States. If Republicans are uncomfortable with not performing their duties, the answer isn't to take an eraser to the Constitution. No, we don't need to take an eraser to the Constitution. The answer is to do your job. If the Senator from Iowa wants to extricate himself from the situation he created, there is a way. All he needs to do is wrest back his chairmanship from the Republican leader and give President Obama's nominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. In short, he needs to do his job. It is that easy. No changes to the Constitution are required. If he does his job, the people in Iowa will not have reason to say: ``This isn't the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1300] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID.

This appeared in the Des Moines Register: ``The position taken now by the majority leader and majority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee is simply astounding, and not in keeping with a `strict,' or even `loose,' construction of the Constitution.'' The Constitution isn't some ball you pick up and take home just because you are still mad that Barack Obama is the President. If Senator Grassley and Republicans find themselves on the wrong side of the Constitution, it is their policies that should change, not our Nation's founding document, the Constitution of the United States. If Republicans are uncomfortable with not performing their duties, the answer isn't to take an eraser to the Constitution. No, we don't need to take an eraser to the Constitution. The answer is to do your job. If the Senator from Iowa wants to extricate himself from the situation he created, there is a way. All he needs to do is wrest back his chairmanship from the Republican leader and give President Obama's nominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. In short, he needs to do his job. It is that easy. No changes to the Constitution are required. If he does his job, the people in Iowa will not have reason to say: ``This isn't the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.'' ____________________",package_114_149.csv,5782,5782,5848,"[congressional record volume 162, number 36 (monday, march 7, 2016)] [senate] [page s1300] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] filling the supreme court vacancy mr. reid. madam president, from the des moines register. two former lieutenant governors of the state of iowa--and i am sure the acting president pro tempore knows both of them, one a democrat and one a republican--here is what they said, among other things: ``this isn't the chuck grassley we thought we knew.'' again, i repeat, this is two iowans, former lieutenant governors joy corning, a republican, and sally pederson, a democrat. last week former lieutenant governors corning and pederson coauthored an op-ed in the des moines register criticizing the senior senator from iowa for abdicating his constitutional duties by blocking consideration of president obama's supreme court nomination. the op-ed reads, among other things: iowans are known for being hard workers, and we appreciate that quality in our elected officials. we wake up every day, ready to do our part, and get the job done. we are also politically astute, understand the u.s. constitution, and know when an elected official is more eager to find excuses than create solutions. unfortunately, sen. chuck grassley is refusing to do his job as described in article 2 of our constitution, giving ``advice and consent'' on the president's upcoming nomination to the supreme court. grassley is threatening to use his powerful post as chairman of the judiciary committee to block a hearing on any nominee, regardless of how well qualified he or she is. his recent column and public statements regarding the vacancy on the supreme court are troubling and harmful to our courts. moreover, this isn't the chuck grassley we thought we knew. ``this isn't the chuck grassley we thought we knew.'' i agree with these iowans. this isn't the senator i have come to know over the last three decades. the senator i knew would not cede the independence of the powerful judiciary committee he has served on for many decades to the republican leader. the senator i knew would not ignore his constitutional duties for the sake of election-year politics, but for whatever reason the senator from iowa made a fateful decision in the hours after justice antonin scalia's death. he is allowing himself and his committee to be manipulated by the republican leader for narrow, partisan warfare. he is taking his orders from the republican leader and, sadly, donald trump. when asked about this issue, donald trump's words were three: delay, delay, delay. senator grassley must have been listening. the people of iowa, without question, are displeased with their senator. the des moines register quoted one of senator grassley's disappointed supporters as follows: he seems to be doing what other people are saying, not what he thinks is best. that has really colored my opinion of him in the past week. another iowan who supports the senator told the newspaper: i think he's making a bad mistake. . . . it's purely a political party play, and there isn't any space for that in this situation. now, as each day passes, the senior senator from iowa is trying desperately to justify his blind loyalty to the republican leader and to donald trump. senator grassley is grasping for a rationale--any rationale--that will excuse him for not doing his job. that desperation is now taking senator grassley down a very dark path. last thursday, the senior senator from iowa addressed the conservative political action conference, cpac, which took place here in washington. in his speech to them, here is what senator grassley said: ``i feel it's about time that we have a national debate on the supreme court and how it fits in with our constitutional system of government.'' the chairman of the judiciary committee is suggesting that we reevaluate the founding fathers' work, reevaluate the constitution of the united states, and change the constitution of the united states. why is senator grassley debating what the constitution makes clear? the senate must provide its advice and consent on nominees appointed by the president to the supreme court. think of the irony. justice scalia was a strict constitutionalist. yet now, in the weeks following his death, senator grassley wants to throw out the constitution just because president obama gets to pick scalia's replacement. the former senator from iowa tom harkin said it best yesterday. this appeared in the des moines register: ``the position taken now by the majority leader and majority members of the senate judiciary committee is simply astounding, and not in keeping with a `strict,' or even `loose,' construction of the constitution.'' the constitution isn't some ball you pick up and take home just because you are still mad that barack obama is the president. if senator grassley and republicans find themselves on the wrong side of the constitution, it is their policies that should change, not our nation's founding document, the constitution of the united states. if republicans are uncomfortable with not performing their duties, the answer isn't to take an eraser to the constitution. no, we don't need to take an eraser to the constitution. the answer is to do your job. if the senator from iowa wants to extricate himself from the situation he created, there is a way. all he needs to do is wrest back his chairmanship from the republican leader and give president obama's nominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. in short, he needs to do his job. it is that easy. no changes to the constitution are required. if he does his job, the people in iowa will not have reason to say: ``this isn't the chuck grassley we thought we knew.'' ____________________",5782

Every day, more and more people who were previously without health insurance are now covered. That is true across racial and ethnic lines. Listen to these stunning statistics. The uninsured rate for African Americans has dropped by more than 50 percent. That is the equivalent of 3 million newly insured people. The uninsured rate for Hispanics dropped by more than 25 percent, representing 4 million insured Americans. The evidence is clear: The Affordable Care Act is working.

It is really nervy for Republicans to come down here, as they do all the time in the Senate--they have been quiet lately--and as they do on the campaign trail.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgS1302,CREC-2016-03-07,114,CALLING FOR APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1302-S1303] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALLING FOR APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have come to the floor several times to talk about the ongoing investigation into the private email server of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While serving as the top diplomat for the United States, she plainly believed she could play by her own set of rules. Instead of using a government server with all of the attendant protections from cyber attacks and intelligence gathering by our adversaries, Secretary Clinton paid a staffer thousands of dollars to set up a private, unsecure [[Page S1303]] email server at her home in New York. So it is pretty clear, based on published reports, that Secretary Clinton went out of her way by paying money out of her own pocket to avoid important laws that Congress has passed to guarantee that the American people actually know what their government is doing. I am talking particularly about the Freedom of Information Act. I haven't heard of any other example of someone in the Federal Government--accountable to the people of the United States--setting up a separate private email server just to conduct official business, not to mention the Secretary of State. It is simply unprecedented. Her actions also put our country at risk, as her private email server was reportedly unsecure. We have heard time and again from those in the intelligence community that her use of an unsecure, private email server left her emails--some highly classified--vulnerable to hacking and cyber attack from our Nation's enemies. We may never know the full extent to which her irresponsible actions have affected our military endeavors, our diplomatic efforts, our overall national security or the lives and safety of those who serve in the intelligence community or are in harm's way trying to keep our country safe. We don't know to what extent her recklessness and irresponsibility have jeopardized the lives of people who are engaged in keeping our country safe. We do know that it has jeopardized the security of our country at large. To this day, Secretary Clinton refuses to accept full responsibility for her actions and denies the serious nature of the FBI's ongoing investigation, calling it only a ``security review.'' Well, it is pretty clear that the Justice Department is doing an investigation. Just this last week, it was reported that the Justice Department granted immunity to the staffer who set up Secretary Clinton's server. So this further confirms that Secretary Clinton is misrepresenting to the public when this inquiry is dismissed as some routine ``security review.'' We don't grant immunity from criminal prosecution to someone in order to gain their cooperation to testify in a case where they otherwise would claim the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. That is why immunity is granted--so they no longer can claim a belief that they might be prosecuted for being a witness against themselves. That is why immunity is granted. So this indicates what I have said all along, which is that this is a serious investigation that may determine that classified information has been mishandled--a serious crime. The Justice Department should pursue this case as aggressively as it would any other case involving any other person where there has been concern about the mishandling of classified information because the American people deserve nothing less. Secretary Clinton is not just some random citizen or former government employee; she was a member of this President's Cabinet and Secretary of State. In light of this extraordinary case and the unavoidable myriad of conflicts of interest, I have called repeatedly on the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to fully and fairly conduct the investigation. It is not just important that a thorough and independent investigation be conducted; it is important that the American people have confidence and believe that a fair and independent investigation is being conducted. One simply can't reach that conclusion, given the fact that the Attorney General, who is the political appointee of this President and who serves at his pleasure, is loathe to have this investigation proceed, and I will get to that in a moment. The President has inappropriately made comments while this investigation is ongoing. I asked the Attorney General last fall--she is the only one who can make this decision--to appoint a special counsel to give some semblance of independence from the political operation at the Department of Justice and the White House. Unfortunately, almost 6 months later, no independent counsel has been appointed. I think the necessity for such a person to be appointed is even more critical than ever. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1302-S1303] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALLING FOR APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL Mr. CORNYN.

Instead of using a government server with all of the attendant protections from cyber attacks and intelligence gathering by our adversaries, Secretary Clinton paid a staffer thousands of dollars to set up a private, unsecure [[Page S1303]] email server at her home in New York. So it is pretty clear, based on published reports, that Secretary Clinton went out of her way by paying money out of her own pocket to avoid important laws that Congress has passed to guarantee that the American people actually know what their government is doing. I am talking particularly about the Freedom of Information Act. I haven't heard of any other example of someone in the Federal Government--accountable to the people of the United States--setting up a separate private email server just to conduct official business, not to mention the Secretary of State. It is simply unprecedented. Her actions also put our country at risk, as her private email server was reportedly unsecure. We have heard time and again from those in the intelligence community that her use of an unsecure, private email server left her emails--some highly classified--vulnerable to hacking and cyber attack from our Nation's enemies. We may never know the full extent to which her irresponsible actions have affected our military endeavors, our diplomatic efforts, our overall national security or the lives and safety of those who serve in the intelligence community or are in harm's way trying to keep our country safe. We don't know to what extent her recklessness and irresponsibility have jeopardized the lives of people who are engaged in keeping our country safe. We do know that it has jeopardized the security of our country at large. To this day, Secretary Clinton refuses to accept full responsibility for her actions and denies the serious nature of the FBI's ongoing investigation, calling it only a ``security review.'' Well, it is pretty clear that the Justice Department is doing an investigation. Just this last week, it was reported that the Justice Department granted immunity to the staffer who set up Secretary Clinton's server. So this further confirms that Secretary Clinton is misrepresenting to the public when this inquiry is dismissed as some routine ``security review.'' We don't grant immunity from criminal prosecution to someone in order to gain their cooperation to testify in a case where they otherwise would claim the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. That is why immunity is granted--so they no longer can claim a belief that they might be prosecuted for being a witness against themselves. That is why immunity is granted. So this indicates what I have said all along, which is that this is a serious investigation that may determine that classified information has been mishandled--a serious crime. The Justice Department should pursue this case as aggressively as it would any other case involving any other person where there has been concern about the mishandling of classified information because the American people deserve nothing less. Secretary Clinton is not just some random citizen or former government employee; she was a member of this President's Cabinet and Secretary of State. In light of this extraordinary case and the unavoidable myriad of conflicts of interest, I have called repeatedly on the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to fully and fairly conduct the investigation. It is not just important that a thorough and independent investigation be conducted; it is important that the American people have confidence and believe that a fair and independent investigation is being conducted. One simply can't reach that conclusion, given the fact that the Attorney General, who is the political appointee of this President and who serves at his pleasure, is loathe to have this investigation proceed, and I will get to that in a moment. The President has inappropriately made comments while this investigation is ongoing. I asked the Attorney General last fall--she is the only one who can make this decision--to appoint a special counsel to give some semblance of independence from the political operation at the Department of Justice and the White House. Unfortunately, almost 6 months later, no independent counsel has been appointed. I think the necessity for such a person to be appointed is even more critical than ever. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1302-S1303] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALLING FOR APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL Mr. CORNYN.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgS1301-3,CREC-2016-03-07,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1301-S1302] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as my colleagues in the Senate just heard, the tantrums from the other side continue, but I guess it shouldn't surprise anybody because everyone around here knows that nothing makes the minority leader more mad than when his side is forced to play by its own rules. The American people are divided, and the divided government the American people delivered over the last several election cycles reflects those divisions. Our constitutional Republic was designed with a series of checks and balances. As any branch gets too powerful or exceeds its authority and tries to impose policies the American people don't want, the people express their will through the electoral process, and that is what we have witnessed during the last several election cycles. Over the last few years, our current President has engaged in a systematic and very massive overreach of his executive power, way beyond what the Constitution has ever considered, and--thank God for checks and balances--the courts have said as much, and that is why I am here today. I am here today to tell you how the courts have interceded and curbed this massive overreach of Executive power. But as he has done so, the people have responded. Since he was first sworn into office in 2009, nearly 70 additional Republicans have been elected to the People's House. And there are 13 more Republican Senators today than there were in January of 2009. In January of 2014, frustrated that the people's representatives wouldn't enact his liberal policies, the President famously said that he would use ``a pen and a phone'' and impose his agenda anyway even though Article One of the Constitution is very clear. It states that the legislative powers of the United States shall be vested in the Congress, not with the President of the United States. Just a few months later, in November of 2014, the people spoke and sent nine additional Republicans to the U.S. Senate. This is the beauty of our system of checks and balances, and the Framers of our Constitution designed it that way. The Framers knew a thing or two about Executive overreach, because they had to deal with somebody called George III. They had firsthand experience with an Executive, King George III, who imposed his will on the people unilaterally. So you wonder why our Constitution has checks and balances? The President holds the Executive power, the Congress writes the laws, and the Supreme Court interprets them. That is what we call separation of powers. That's why we have checks and balances. That's why we have separation of powers. And that is why our Constitution is designed so that no President can appoint a Supreme Court Justice with a pen and a phone. As we continue to discuss what is at stake during this Presidential election and whether the American people want to elect a President who will appoint yet another liberal Justice, I wanted to take a few minutes to review some of this President's efforts to expand the reach of his power and impose his will on the American people. This President has pushed the envelope at every turn. He has sought to impose his will on the American people in ways and to a degree that this Nation has never before witnessed. What is striking about this President's record before the Supreme Court is that even with a Court as liberal as ours, the Obama administration still has the lowest winning record of any President going back to at least the Truman administration. When presented with this undeniable fact, the President's apologists quickly grasp for the nearest bogus defense. Most notably, they claim that the Supreme Court is more ideologically hostile to this President than previous Courts were to other Presidents. Now that is a very crafty argument, but it is what Justice Scalia would have called ``pure applesauce.'' Leading Supreme Court analysts declared the last term of the Supreme Court, even with Justice Scalia on that Court, as the most liberal since the 1960s. So the President's defenders can't blame the Court's makeup for its rebuke of his expansive claims of power. And of course this explanation fails to account for the fact that President Eisenhower took office and litigated in a Supreme Court with eight Justices who were appointed by Democrats or that President Nixon's administration began with an even more liberal Court than Eisenhower. No, this President hasn't lost cases because the Court is ideologically hostile to this President and his policy; the Court has rejected this President's power grabs because they are based on ideology and an unwillingness to recognize that the law constrains that power. All too often the President's claims are supported by an Office of Legal Counsel and a Solicitor General's Office that seem unwilling to tell the President that his impulse for expanded power is flatly contrary to the law. I'd like to describe a few examples. The President's lawyers argued that he could ignore the Senate's determination--this body's determination--of when it was in session in order to make recess appointments. No President in our history ever claimed that recess appointments were permissible in that situation. But the Office of Legal Counsel--once considered the crown jewel of the Department of Justice--offered a tortured justification to sanction that assertion of power. If this view of Presidential power were allowed to stand, the President could bypass the Senate with ease to install individuals in powerful government positions with no check from the [[Page S1302]] Senate, as the Constitution envisions. Fortunately, the Supreme Court disagreed 9 to 0. That means even this President's appointments to the Supreme Court said that he violated the Constitution with those recess appointments. The Constitution clearly says that the Senate shall determine when we are in session and in recess. That isn't the only example. The Obama administration argued that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission could resolve an employment discrimination case between a minister and the church that fired her. The Supreme Court found the Obama administration managed to violate two different provisions of the First Amendment at the same time. It violated the free exercise of religion clause because if the President's argument carried the day, the government could interfere with a church's doctrine. Additionally, it violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment because if this President had his way, the Federal Government could get into the business of selecting a church's ministers. The Supreme Court rejected those claims 9 to 0. On the regulatory front, in a series of rulings, the Supreme Court rejected the President's arguments that agencies can deny the ability of private citizens to seek relief against regulatory overreach. For instance, the Court rejected the Environmental Protection Agency's powers to force a homeowner, through escalating fines, to comply with an order while at the same time denying that homeowner the ability to challenge the order in court. The Supreme Court rejected Obama's EPA's claims 9 to 0. In another case, the Court held--contrary to the position advanced by the Army Corps of Engineers--that a landowner could sue in court for just compensation for a taking when the government-caused flooding of his property is temporary and recurring. Again, the Supreme Court rejected the government's position 8 to 0. When the Internal Revenue Service attempted to enforce a taxpayer's summons while at the same time denying the taxpayer the right to question the IRS official about their reasons for the summons, the Supreme Court rebuked the administration 9 to 0. In still another case, the Court rejected the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's argument that its decisions aren't subject to judicial review when that agency concludes by its own estimation it fulfilled its duties to attempt conciliation under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Once again, the Supreme Court rejected that claim by this administration 9 to 0. Similarly, when a veteran's benefits were denied and the appeal wasn't filed within a certain time period, the Department of Veterans Affairs turned around and denied that veteran the ability to seek judicial review. The Supreme Court rejected the position of the Department of Veterans Affairs 8 to 0. And when the Federal Communications Commission changed its policies midstream regarding isolated examples of indecent language, the Supreme Court found 8 to 0 that the FCC had violated due process. These are important rulings. Far too often, this administration imposes government power against the people while brushing aside important procedural safeguards. Remember, the Constitution is to protect the people from its government--something we learned from George III. Justice Frankfurter spoke to this point. He once wrote: ``The history of liberty has largely been the history of the observance of procedural safeguards.'' Consider as well areas in criminal law where the Obama administration pressed positions that erode individual freedom. This President's lawyers argued that the police could install a GPS device on a vehicle, and then use that device to monitor the car's movements without a search warrant under the Fourth Amendment. I don't know what would be left of the Fourth Amendment if the Supreme Court had upheld the President's claim that the government could operate in that manner. Thankfully, the Supreme Court rejected that argument as well. The vote tally was 9 to 0. The Court blocked the Justice Department's prosecution of a person under the Chemical Weapons Convention because the convention didn't reach the defendant's simple assault. Again, the Supreme Court rebuked the President 9 to 0. These are not the rulings of a Supreme Court that is ideologically hostile to the Obama administration. Every one of these rulings was unanimous--every one. And there are still other Supreme Court decisions rejecting this President's power grabs where the vote tallies were much closer. The President and his lawyers made utterly baseless arguments for executive and regulatory power in case after case. In so many of these cases, the unifying thread underlying this President's litigating position is the notion that the people are subservient to the Federal Government and, of course, subservient to its agencies, rather than the other way around. So far the Supreme Court has not agreed. But during this Presidential election, the American people should consider whether they want to elect a President who may nominate a Justice who will embrace such a vast expansion of executive and regulatory power. This is what I've called for in a number of speeches, both in Iowa and here as well. This is an opportunity for the American people to have their voices heard. Letting the people decide in the election isn't just about who the next Justice on the Supreme Court is going to be. It is about the role of the Supreme Court and the judicial branch in our constitutional process. We heard just a little while ago the floor leader of the minority party saying that somehow I want to rewrite the Constitution. This isn't about rewriting the Constitution. The Constitution is pretty clear: The Supreme Court interprets law, not makes law. And with the approval rating of the Supreme Court going down from about 50 percent to 28 percent in polls ever since this President took office, and the tendency for some Republican appointees as well as Democrat appointees to make the law the way they want it, that is just getting back to the basics--that the Supreme Court is an interpreter of the law, not a maker of the law. So I think having a basic debate similar to what people learn in high school isn't a bad thing. Now, will an election change what the Supreme Court, the people who are on it now, decide to do? I don't know--probably not. But it will allow for the next elected President to have the opportunity to choose which direction they want it to go. Do they want a Justice who is going to interpret the law or a Justice who is going to make the law? Before the passing of Justice Scalia, we had four conservative justices, four liberal justices, and one in the middle--Justice Kennedy--who could go either way in some cases. We know what kind of judicial activists this President puts on the Supreme Court. Do you want to change the direction so that the Second Amendment rights of guns are in jeopardy or like when we saw attempts by this administration to say who a church can hire or not hire--and violate the freedom of religion--and other very important issues that are at stake? It is pretty fundamental what is at stake, and I think having this debate is very important. And I think letting the people decide is very important. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1301-S1302] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. GRASSLEY.

It is about the role of the Supreme Court and the judicial branch in our constitutional process. We heard just a little while ago the floor leader of the minority party saying that somehow I want to rewrite the Constitution. This isn't about rewriting the Constitution. The Constitution is pretty clear: The Supreme Court interprets law, not makes law. And with the approval rating of the Supreme Court going down from about 50 percent to 28 percent in polls ever since this President took office, and the tendency for some Republican appointees as well as Democrat appointees to make the law the way they want it, that is just getting back to the basics--that the Supreme Court is an interpreter of the law, not a maker of the law. So I think having a basic debate similar to what people learn in high school isn't a bad thing. Now, will an election change what the Supreme Court, the people who are on it now, decide to do? I don't know--probably not. But it will allow for the next elected President to have the opportunity to choose which direction they want it to go. Do they want a Justice who is going to interpret the law or a Justice who is going to make the law? Before the passing of Justice Scalia, we had four conservative justices, four liberal justices, and one in the middle--Justice Kennedy--who could go either way in some cases. We know what kind of judicial activists this President puts on the Supreme Court. Do you want to change the direction so that the Second Amendment rights of guns are in jeopardy or like when we saw attempts by this administration to say who a church can hire or not hire--and violate the freedom of religion--and other very important issues that are at stake? It is pretty fundamental what is at stake, and I think having this debate is very important. And I think letting the people decide is very important. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1301-S1302] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as my colleagues in the Senate just heard, the tantrums from the other side continue, but I guess it shouldn't surprise anybody because everyone around here knows that nothing makes the minority leader more mad than when his side is forced to play by its own rules. The American people are divided, and the divided government the American people delivered over the last several election cycles reflects those divisions. Our constitutional Republic was designed with a series of checks and balances. As any branch gets too powerful or exceeds its authority and tries to impose policies the American people don't want, the people express their will through the electoral process, and that is what we have witnessed during the last several election cycles. Over the last few years, our current President has engaged in a systematic and very massive overreach of his executive power, way beyond what the Constitution has ever considered, and--thank God for checks and balances--the courts have said as much, and that is why I am here today. I am here today to tell you how the courts have interceded and curbed this massive overreach of Executive power. But as he has done so, the people have responded. Since he was first sworn into office in 2009, nearly 70 additional Republicans have been elected to the People's House. And there are 13 more Republican Senators today than there were in January of 2009. In January of 2014, frustrated that the people's representatives wouldn't enact his liberal policies, the President famously said that he would use ``a pen and a phone'' and impose his agenda anyway even though Article One of the Constitution is very clear. It states that the legislative powers of the United States shall be vested in the Congress, not with the President of the United States. Just a few months later, in November of 2014, the people spoke and sent nine additional Republicans to the U.S. Senate. This is the beauty of our system of checks and balances, and the Framers of our Constitution designed it that way. The Framers knew a thing or two about Executive overreach, because they had to deal with somebody called George III. They had firsthand experience with an Executive, King George III, who imposed his will on the people unilaterally. So you wonder why our Constitution has checks and balances? The President holds the Executive power, the Congress writes the laws, and the Supreme Court interprets them. That is what we call separation of powers. That's why we have checks and balances. That's why we have separation of powers. And that is why our Constitution is designed so that no President can appoint a Supreme Court Justice with a pen and a phone. As we continue to discuss what is at stake during this Presidential election and whether the American people want to elect a President who will appoint yet another liberal Justice, I wanted to take a few minutes to review some of this President's efforts to expand the reach of his power and impose his will on the American people. This President has pushed the envelope at every turn. He has sought to impose his will on the American people in ways and to a degree that this Nation has never before witnessed. What is striking about this President's record before the Supreme Court is that even with a Court as liberal as ours, the Obama administration still has the lowest winning record of any President going back to at least the Truman administration. When presented with this undeniable fact, the President's apologists quickly grasp for the nearest bogus defense. Most notably, they claim that the Supreme Court is more ideologically hostile to this President than previous Courts were to other Presidents. Now that is a very crafty argument, but it is what Justice Scalia would have called ``pure applesauce.'' Leading Supreme Court analysts declared the last term of the Supreme Court, even with Justice Scalia on that Court, as the most liberal since the 1960s. So the President's defenders can't blame the Court's makeup for its rebuke of his expansive claims of power. And of course this explanation fails to account for the fact that President Eisenhower took office and litigated in a Supreme Court with eight Justices who were appointed by Democrats or that President Nixon's administration began with an even more liberal Court than Eisenhower. No, this President hasn't lost cases because the Court is ideologically hostile to this President and his policy; the Court has rejected this President's power grabs because they are based on ideology and an unwillingness to recognize that the law constrains that power. All too often the President's claims are supported by an Office of Legal Counsel and a Solicitor General's Office that seem unwilling to tell the President that his impulse for expanded power is flatly contrary to the law. I'd like to describe a few examples. The President's lawyers argued that he could ignore the Senate's determination--this body's determination--of when it was in session in order to make recess appointments. No President in our history ever claimed that recess appointments were permissible in that situation. But the Office of Legal Counsel--once considered the crown jewel of the Department of Justice--offered a tortured justification to sanction that assertion of power. If this view of Presidential power were allowed to stand, the President could bypass the Senate with ease to install individuals in powerful government positions with no check from the [[Page S1302]] Senate, as the Constitution envisions. Fortunately, the Supreme Court disagreed 9 to 0. That means even this President's appointments to the Supreme Court said that he violated the Constitution with those recess appointments. The Constitution clearly says that the Senate shall determine when we are in session and in recess. That isn't the only example. The Obama administration argued that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission could resolve an employment discrimination case between a minister and the church that fired her. The Supreme Court found the Obama administration managed to violate two different provisions of the First Amendment at the same time. It violated the free exercise of religion clause because if the President's argument carried the day, the government could interfere with a church's doctrine. Additionally, it violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment because if this President had his way, the Federal Government could get into the business of selecting a church's ministers. The Supreme Court rejected those claims 9 to 0. On the regulatory front, in a series of rulings, the Supreme Court rejected the President's arguments that agencies can deny the ability of private citizens to seek relief against regulatory overreach. For instance, the Court rejected the Environmental Protection Agency's powers to force a homeowner, through escalating fines, to comply with an order while at the same time denying that homeowner the ability to challenge the order in court. The Supreme Court rejected Obama's EPA's claims 9 to 0. In another case, the Court held--contrary to the position advanced by the Army Corps of Engineers--that a landowner could sue in court for just compensation for a taking when the government-caused flooding of his property is temporary and recurring. Again, the Supreme Court rejected the government's position 8 to 0. When the Internal Revenue Service attempted to enforce a taxpayer's summons while at the same time denying the taxpayer the right to question the IRS official about their reasons for the summons, the Supreme Court rebuked the administration 9 to 0. In still another case, the Court rejected the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's argument that its decisions aren't subject to judicial review when that agency concludes by its own estimation it fulfilled its duties to attempt conciliation under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Once again, the Supreme Court rejected that claim by this administration 9 to 0. Similarly, when a veteran's benefits were denied and the appeal wasn't filed within a certain time period, the Department of Veterans Affairs turned around and denied that veteran the ability to seek judicial review. The Supreme Court rejected the position of the Department of Veterans Affairs 8 to 0. And when the Federal Communications Commission changed its policies midstream regarding isolated examples of indecent language, the Supreme Court found 8 to 0 that the FCC had violated due process. These are important rulings. Far too often, this administration imposes government power against the people while brushing aside important procedural safeguards. Remember, the Constitution is to protect the people from its government--something we learned from George III. Justice Frankfurter spoke to this point. He once wrote: ``The history of liberty has largely been the history of the observance of procedural safeguards.'' Consider as well areas in criminal law where the Obama administration pressed positions that erode individual freedom. This President's lawyers argued that the police could install a GPS device on a vehicle, and then use that device to monitor the car's movements without a search warrant under the Fourth Amendment. I don't know what would be left of the Fourth Amendment if the Supreme Court had upheld the President's claim that the government could operate in that manner. Thankfully, the Supreme Court rejected that argument as well. The vote tally was 9 to 0. The Court blocked the Justice Department's prosecution of a person under the Chemical Weapons Convention because the convention didn't reach the defendant's simple assault. Again, the Supreme Court rebuked the President 9 to 0. These are not the rulings of a Supreme Court that is ideologically hostile to the Obama administration. Every one of these rulings was unanimous--every one. And there are still other Supreme Court decisions rejecting this President's power grabs where the vote tallies were much closer. The President and his lawyers made utterly baseless arguments for executive and regulatory power in case after case. In so many of these cases, the unifying thread underlying this President's litigating position is the notion that the people are subservient to the Federal Government and, of course, subservient to its agencies, rather than the other way around. So far the Supreme Court has not agreed. But during this Presidential election, the American people should consider whether they want to elect a President who may nominate a Justice who will embrace such a vast expansion of executive and regulatory power. This is what I've called for in a number of speeches, both in Iowa and here as well. This is an opportunity for the American people to have their voices heard. Letting the people decide in the election isn't just about who the next Justice on the Supreme Court is going to be. It is about the role of the Supreme Court and the judicial branch in our constitutional process.

Pending: Grassley amendment No. 3378, in the nature of a substitute. Grassley (for Donnelly/Capito) modified amendment No. 3374 (to amendment No. 3378), to provide follow-up services to individuals who have received opioid overdose reversal drugs. Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, before I begin, as we discuss the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Whitehouse for his role in developing the bill and bringing it this far. I also convey my gratitude to Minority Leader Reid and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for their excellent staffs and for urging that my amendments--which I will address momentarily--be a part of the discussion and for managing the negotiations on this bill. I also thank Senator Murray, the ranking member of the HELP Committee, for help and counsel on amendments. Let us pause for a moment and consider the causes of the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic gripping our country. Understanding the causes will help us focus on the right solutions. Three distinct parties bear much of the blame for this public health crisis. First, there is Big Pharma. In the mid-1990s, the seeds of this epidemic [[Page S1304]] were planted with the aggressive, misleading, and ultimately criminal marketing of the powerful opioid painkiller, OxyContin by Purdue Pharma. Perdue claimed OxyContin was not addictive and couldn't be abused. Neither of those claims turned out to be true. Purdue Pharma built a massive marketing and sales program for OxyContin. From 1996 to 2000, Purdue Pharma's sales force more than doubled from more than 300 sales representatives to almost 700 sales representatives. In 2001 alone, Purdue gave out $40 million in bonuses to its burgeoning sales force. As a result of these sales and marketing efforts, from 1997 to 2002, OxyContin prescriptions increased almost tenfold, from 670,000 in 1997 to 6.2 million in 2002. Purdue's marketing of OxyContin broke the law. In 2007, Purdue Pharma paid $600 million in fines and other payments after pleading guilty in Federal court to misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the risks of addiction to OxyContin and its potential for abuse. Second, Purdue Pharma's criminal wrongdoing did not occur in a vacuum. The Federal Government helped to enable this epidemic. The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration is responsible for approving the annual production quotas for pharmaceutical companies to manufacture oxycodone, the principal ingredient in OxyContin. From 1996 to 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration obliged Big Pharma and increased by almost 150 percent the amount of oxycodone authorized for manufacture. In 1996, the DEA authorized U.S. pharmaceutical companies to make the equivalent of 6 billion 10-milligram OxyContin pills. By 2016, that figure had increased to almost 14 billion 10-milligram pills. That is right. Today the Drug Enforcement Administration is telling Big Pharma it is OK to make 14 billion OxyContin pills to sell in the United States in 1 year. The Federal Food and Drug Administration was also complicit, approving new opioid after new opioid. In the process, the FDA, charged with ensuring the safety of all prescription drugs on the U.S. market, began turning a blind eye to outside experts who were warning of the dangers these drugs posed. In 2013, an expert panel established to review the powerful new opioid painkiller Zohydro, voted 11 to 2 against recommending its approval, but the FDA approved the drug anyway, overruling the concerns voiced by experienced physicians on the panel. In 2014, in the wake of the Zohydro decision, the FDA twice skipped the advisory committee process altogether when it approved two new prescription opioids. Then, in August of 2015, the FDA did it again. This time it bypassed an advisory committee of outside experts on the question of a new use for OxyContin for children aged 11 to 16. The FDA even ignored its own rules that specifically call for advisory committee advice when a committee of pediatric dosing is involved. It was clear that the FDA was intentionally choosing to forgo advisory committees in order to avoid another overwhelming Zohydro-like vote, recommending against approval of a prescription opioid and in order to avoid any impediments to new opioids being sold in the United States. Finally, the medical profession must bear its fair share of responsibility for this crisis. Doctors are prescribing opioids at an alarming rate. In 2012, America's doctors wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain relievers, enough pills for every single American adult to have a bottle of opioid pills given to them in the year 2012. And America's doctors are dangerously uninformed about the drugs they are prescribing. A recent survey of 1,000 physicians nationwide found that ``only two-thirds correctly reported that the most common route of abuse was swallowing pills whole.'' It is unconscionable that our doctors are so ill-informed. Nearly half of the doctors surveyed also erroneously reported that so-called abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids were less addictive than their counterparts. Abuse-deterrent opioids are supposed to be harder to crush, so they are harder to snort or to mix with liquid and inject, but abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids are just as addictive as non-abuse-deterrent opioids. Whether an opioid is abuse-deterrent or not hasn't prevented tens of thousands of people who have had their wisdom teeth removed or experienced lower back pain from getting addicted to these painkillers simply by swallowing them. So what is the result of the combination of Big Pharma's marketing of prescription opioids, the Federal Government's repeatedly approving them in ever-increasing numbers, and our doctors writing millions of prescriptions for them? Today, the United States is less than 5 percent of the world's population but we consume 80 percent of the world's opioid painkillers. We have become the United States of Oxy. When prescriptions run out or the price of Oxy pills on the street become too high for those who have become addicted, they turn to cheaper heroin, which shares the same molecular structure as OxyContin. Eighty percent of the people suffering from heroin addiction started with opioid pain medications approved by the FDA and prescribed by doctors. In 2014, nearly 33,000 people died of an opioid overdose in this country. Almost 1,300 of those deaths were in my home State of Massachusetts. I had hoped to offer amendments to CARA to address both the causes of this epidemic and to provide treatment for those suffering from the results. One of my amendments would have required the FDA to convene advisory committees for all prescription opioid approval questions. After I placed a hold on the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf to serve as FDA Commissioner, the agency announced it would only commit to convene advisory committees for non-abuse-deterrent opioids. The FDA refused to agree to convene advisory committees to inform all of its opioid-approval decisions. We need legislation requiring the FDA to seek expert advice about the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids, and I will continue to fight to require advisory committees at the FDA. We also need legislation requiring doctors to get and stay educated about the dangers of the pills they are prescribing in record numbers. Stopping the overprescription of opioid painkillers is a critical step. We need to ensure that all prescribers of these opioid painkillers are educated in the dangers of these drugs, how easily individuals can become addicted, and when and how to appropriately prescribe. The doctors say that they do not want education to be mandated, that it should be voluntary. Well, the FDA has had voluntary education for opioid prescribers in place since 2013 and has been actively encouraging doctors to take these voluntary education programs, but in more than 2 years, only 12 percent of prescribers have actually completed FDA's voluntary education program. It is imperative that any provider who is applying for a Federal DEA license to prescribe opioids have completed mandatory education on the basics of opioid prescribing and the inherent risk of addiction. My amendment would have done just that. It would have required basic education as a condition of a DEA license to prescribe these painkillers, and I will continue to fight to require prescriber education. Finally, we need to remove the barriers to effective treatment, including outdated Federal restrictions on medication-assisted therapies such as Suboxone. Medication-assisted therapy for opioid addiction is cost effective, decreases overdose deaths, and reduces transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. Unlike other treatment regimens for any other disease, physicians are severely limited in the number of patients they can treat with medication-assisted therapies such as Suboxone, contributing to long wait-lists and an inability of patients to get treatment for their addiction when they need it. Of approximately 2.5 million Americans who abused or were dependent on opioids, fewer than 1 million received treatment for their condition, partly because of the already existing Federal instructions. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and I have a bipartisan bill, the Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act, or TREAT Act, which has broad stakeholder support, including the American Medical Association and nurse practitioners. It emphasizes quality of care and closes this gaping [[Page S1305]] hole in our addiction treatment system. We had hoped to offer TREAT as an amendment to CARA. We will continue to fight for it and are hopeful the HELP Committee will include it in the substance abuse legislation the committee will soon consider. My collaboration with Senator Paul shows that whether it is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the Commonwealth of Kentucky, this crisis is the same. It doesn't discriminate by geography, by age, by race, by socioeconomic status, or by employment. It requires a bipartisan effort. Thirty years ago, Nancy Reagan told us to just say no to drugs. Today we have to go further. We have to say enough is enough. We have to recognize what has worked and what hasn't worked. In the past, we believed we could incarcerate our way out of the problem. That did not work. So instead of ignoring and incarcerating, let's avow and act. Let's destigmatize, not criminalize. Let's treat, not retreat. Let's have a comprehensive plan which we put in place that deals with the pharmaceutical companies, the physicians, and the kinds of treatment patients need across our country so that they get the help they need. That is our job. I continue to believe we can do this in a bipartisan fashion as long as we understand the magnitude of the problem and what the causes of it were and continue to be and will be into the future unless and until we put these safeguards in place. So I am looking forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I compliment them for the work they have done so far in bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate this week, but I do believe there is more to be done. As long as this many Americans are addicted, as long as this much OxyContin and opioids are put into our system, then we are going to find that this heroin epidemic we have in our country, which is directly related, will continue to spiral out of control. I want to work with all my colleagues. I thank my colleagues for all the work they have done so far, but there is much work to be done in the future. Madam President, I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to talk for a few minutes about the crime problem we have in America today, the dramatically increasing problem of heroin abuse. Over the last week, we have had a lot of discussion about this crisis, which I am afraid we are just on the cusp of. I think it is going to get worse, based on my experience and my best judgment, but the effort to understand and address it has been going on for a while. In January, we had a good hearing on this issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I want to mention a few things I think we ought to keep in mind as we address this very important problem. Just as background, I served 15 years as a prosecutor, 12 as a U.S. attorney, a Federal prosecutor, and 2\1/2\ as an assistant U.S. attorney. So that was my background when I came here. I was very active and studied the drug and crime problem in America, and I learned some things. There are cycles in this, and people wrote about it over the years. I think we are, unfortunately, moving into another cycle, and we have to be very careful. It is so painful to have a large prison population. We don't want to have that. Year after year, everybody wants to look for alternatives to prison, and we have tried, but if you go too far, you end up not having sufficient consequences for crime, not detaining dangerous offenders, and you end up increasing crime, increasing deaths of Americans from murders and other things, increasing heroin and serious drug problems that destroy families, destroy lives, destroy communities, and result in violence and death. It is a very real problem. A lot of people think, well, if you want to use heroin, so be it. Well, these people can't function. How are they going to survive? They either steal or they get on welfare or they have to go to treatment. And who pays for it, since they do not have any money? We have proven and seen for decades that drug use can be brought down, fewer people can become addicted. In the early 1980s, Nancy Reagan, as President Reagan's wonderful wife, formed the ``Just Say No'' program, and hundreds of thousands of volunteers nationwide in every community in America got together in their communities--they got the treatment community, the law enforcement community, the prevention community, the education community, and the schools--and they worked and worked and crafted policies that would create a climate of hostility for the use of dangerous drugs. The idea was to bring down the use. As a result, the use of illegal drugs dropped by half. It took us 15 or more years, but it dropped by half steadily. What a tremendous victory. In 1980, half of our high school seniors admitted they had used an illegal drug sometime in that year. What an unbelievable number. It had been going up steadily, it peaked, and then it began to go down under this sustained effort. What I have been worried about for some time, and have warned about it, is that if you don't maintain that but start going in the other direction, you can expect drug use to increase. It is that simple. And it is happening. Lives--and young people's lives--will be destroyed by this, families will break up, and children will be scarred. Drug use is no fun, innocent thing. It is destructive. If this Nation is using half as much illegal drugs as before, it is a better nation. It just is. And if we double the amount of drug use in America, it will be a more dangerous Nation and not as good a nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 47,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014. In 2014, 47,000 died. That is one drug overdose death for every 12 minutes. And 61 percent of those overdoses involved opioids. The rate of all opioid overdoses in the United States has tripled since 2000. Overdoses have tripled since 2000. Heroin overdose deaths specifically have increased sixfold since 2001--600 percent--and have more than tripled in just the past 4 years alone. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there were approximately 169,000 new heroin users in 2013. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 2004, approximately 589,000 people in the United States had an opioid use disorder. We used to call that addiction--a problem. It is affecting their lives. The Drug Enforcement Administration's 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment noted that ``drug overdose deaths have become the leading cause of injury death in the United States, ahead of motor vehicle deaths and firearms.'' This is a significant matter. As DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg, a bright, young mind appointed by President Obama, noted last July that ``[a]pproximately 120 people die each day in the United States of a drug overdose.'' Some argue that the increase in heroin abuse is due to over- prescription of opioids from prescription drugs--you get addicted from a prescription drug, and then you move to heroin. I am sure that has some validity, but according to a January 14, 2016, study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the premier authoritative medical journals in the world: In the majority of studies, the increase in the rates of heroin use preceded the change in prescription-opioid policies, and there is no consistent evidence of an association between the implementation of policies related to prescription opioids and increases in the rates of heroin use or deaths, although the data are relatively sparse. Alternatively, heroin market forces-- Please hear this, colleagues-- Alternatively, heroin market forces, including increased accessibility, reduced price, and high purity of heroin appear to be major drivers of the recent increases in rates of heroin use. So it is purity, price, and accessibility. While treatment and accountability are critical to breaking the cycle of addiction, it is not the whole solution. We must also reduce the availability of heroin--we simply have to do that--and other illicit opioids. In December of last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said it is important ``that law enforcement''--a lot of people don't want to talk about this. We have police officers, sheriffs' deputies, Federal agents, drug enforcement [[Page S1306]] agents, and Border Patrol agents. He said it is important ``that law enforcement intensify efforts to reduce the availability of heroin, illegal fentanyl, and other illegal opioids.'' Similarly, Drug Enforcement Administration Acting Administrator Rosenberg said in the DEA's National Drug Threat Assessment that, in addition to providing treatment to addicted opioid abusers, ``law enforcement must continue to have the tools it needs to attack criminal groups who facilitate drug addiction.'' I have been there. I was part of law enforcement's efforts. I invested a tremendous amount of my time in the Coalition for a Drug Free Mobile, the Partnership for Youth, Bay Area Drug Council--groups like that--working on a volunteer basis to change the use of drugs in the community. Law enforcement was always a critical part of it, and law enforcement does have the capability in ways that others don't to reduce the availability, make purity levels less, and otherwise restrict, raising the price of an illegal drug. The DEA's 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment confirms this. They studied the price of the drugs. One thing that tells us whether or not law enforcement and interdiction are effective is to discover if the price is going up or down. Mexican drug cartels are flooding the United States with cheap heroin and methamphetamine. When I was a young prosecutor, it was coming from Turkey, the Middle East, and that was pretty much shut off. President Carter did some good things. I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and came back a few years later as a U.S. Attorney, but during that time they somehow reduced the supply of heroin from the Middle East. As a result, heroin addiction dropped all over the country, and very little heroin was in the heartland of America--mainly just in the big cities. We are also getting cheap methamphetamine from across the Mexican border, which is wide open. The statistics from the DEA Drug Threat Assessment confirm that, from 2010 to 2014, the amount of heroin seized every year at the southwest border has more than doubled. Well, are we catching that much more? No, we are not catching, I am sure, any substantially larger percentage. We are just having a larger amount moving across the border. The price has fallen, so we know we have more. If prices stay low, more people will try it more often, and as the purity level is higher, more people will get addicted sooner and often die quicker. These drug cartels are partnering with criminal gangs and fueling violence in our cities and communities. According to DEA's 2015 Threat Assessment, Mexican drug cartels ``control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their presence in the United States, particularly in heroin markets.'' They import, transport, and are now actually selling it in our cities instead of just bringing it in across the border. In 2013, the heads of the Chicago Crime Commission and the Chicago Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration both named El Chapo Guzman, the infamous leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, as Chicago's ``Public Enemy #1.'' So a man in Mexico, moving heroin and methamphetamine into the United States and hammering Chicago with it-- Chicago named him as their No. 1 public enemy. It cannot be a coincidence, as the FBI's uniform crime statistics show, that the murder rate in Chicago increased by approximately 18 percent during the first 6 months of 2015. At that rate, it is a 36 percent increase in murders in Chicago in 1 year. This is an unbelievably dramatic surge in murders. Another example is Atlanta. DEA's Atlanta office reported an increase of heroin availability from a rating of ``stable'' in the first half of 2013 to ``high'' just a year later. According to the FBI's uniform crime statistics, the murder rate in Atlanta increased by approximately 15 percent in the first 6 months of 2015. This is an unsustainable thing. The old rule is a 7-percent increase and your money doubles in 10 years. When you get 15- and 18-percent increases in 6 months--that's 30 percent in 1 year--you are doubling the crime rate, the murder rate, in 3 years. At a November hearing of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I asked DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley about these drug distribution networks and the people in local communities pushing the drugs, selling the drugs, and collecting the money. This money eventually ends up back in Mexico, Colombia, and South and Central America, funding the evil, violent drug cartels that are destabilizing whole nations. He responded that it is ``almost as big a problem as the cartels themselves.'' When I asked him whether these drug traffickers are the ones causing the violence and death on our streets, he responded that ``they are the ones that regulate themselves by the barrel of a gun.'' If you want to collect a drug debt, you can't file a lawsuit in Federal court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun. By its very nature, drug distribution networks are violent criminals. It has always been so, and it will always be so. Conducting an illegal enterprise, they have to maintain discipline, and they use threats and violence to maintain it and collect their debts. We must not forget what became obvious in the early 1980s, when I was a U.S. Attorney: Drug dealers and their organizations are not nonviolent criminals. These are violent crimes. Rather than enforcing the law and making it tougher on drug cartels by keeping our border secure, the Obama administration has done exactly the opposite. Our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to flood our country with cheap heroin, and the administration has made it clear that officers are not to deviate from the President's lawless immigration policy. They are blocked from doing their job and following their oath. Just last week--and as someone who has worked closely with Federal Drug Enforcement officers and immigration officers as a Federal prosecutor--Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske testified before the House Committee on Appropriations that ``if you don't want to follow the directions of your superiors, including the president of the United States and the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, then you really do need to look for another job.'' Do you hear what he is saying there, colleagues? What he is saying is that if you want to do your job and enforce the laws as the laws are written, which we have ordered you not to do, and you go on and do it anyway, then look for another job. It is one of the most amazing things I have seen in my entire law enforcement career. ICE officers-- Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers--who enforce drug laws, along with immigration laws, these officers sued their supervisors. They sued their supervisors, alleging that they were being ordered to violate their oath to enforce the immigration laws of the United States by these restrictive policies. It is hard to overestimate the destruction the Obama administration's policies--their Executive amnesty, their refusal to sufficiently fund and man the border--are causing to law enforcement. A big part of this now is the openness to heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, and other drugs that are being imported. I take that statement by the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection as a direct threat to those officers who want to follow their oath and do their duty. In August 2013, a dramatic event occurred that was too little appreciated. Attorney General Holder, the Attorney General of the United States, ordered Federal prosecutors not to charge certain drug offenders with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences that are in law. If you have so much drugs, you have a minimum penalty. You can get more than that, but you at least have to serve this minimum penalty. He ordered them not to charge those crimes. This is directing prosecutors not to follow the law. It has contributed to a decrease in the number of traffickers being prosecuted and convicted. According to data from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, at the end of 2015--in December--the 6-month average of drug prosecutions was down 21 percent compared to 5 years ago. And what are we seeing? A surge in crime, particularly drugs. Excluding prosecutions in magistrate courts, the 6-month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. We haven't cut the number of drug prosecutors. We haven't cut the [[Page S1307]] number of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we have been doing for 25 years, and it is having an impact. I am afraid it is going to continue. Meanwhile, State and local law enforcement agencies are not given the tools they need to continue taking these dangerous drug traffickers off of the streets. On December 21, 2015, the Department of Justice chose to stop all equitable sharing payments to State, local, and tribal partners under the Asset Forfeiture Program. These are seized proceeds, moneys that are seized from drug dealers, big fancy cars and boats that they seize. For the last 20 years, Federal and State officers worked together. The Federal Government has a good system for forfeiting the money. Then, when the forfeiture is over, it is divided among the agencies. As a result, State and local people are willing to commit law officers to participate in these local task forces because they are helping clean up drugs in their community, helping identify and prosecute nationally significant drug dealers, and they get some compensation back from it when they find a truck full of money. I personally have seen cases where $1 million, $500,000, $800,000 in cash was seized from these people. Some people think, oh, this is wrong; you shouldn't take their cash. This is the ill-gotten gain of an illegal enterprise and they should be able to keep it? They have no proof of any lawful source of this money. Virtually every time, in addition, there is evidence to prove it is connected to drugs. Half the time, they don't even show up to contest the seizure because they know they have no defense to it. This stops this sharing, and it is undermining the unity of effort that we really need to be successful. A joint letter signed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National District Attorneys Association, and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, pointed out that ``the suspension of equitable sharing payments may cause some agencies across the country to reconsider their ability to participate in joint task forces with the Federal Government.'' In other words, they are going to stop participating. ``The effects of this decision are far reaching and not only a disservice to law enforcement, but also to the public they are sworn to protect.'' Mr. President, if there is a limit on my time or others are waiting to speak, I will wrap up. Otherwise, I have about 5 minutes to wrap up. I see my colleague Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I don't want to block him. If my time is up, I will yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). There is no time limit in place. Mr. SESSIONS. While law enforcement resources are being cut off, law enforcement officers are being blocked from doing their jobs, and drug prosecutions are being reduced, the administration and some in Congress want to push and advance a criminal justice ``reform'' bill. But these proposals will have a tendency, I am afraid, to worsen the current problem by allowing for more reductions in sentences than are already occurring and early release of thousands of dangerous drug traffickers, and the weakening of penalties for those prosecuted under our drug trafficking laws, which have already been weakened--sending the wrong message at exactly the wrong time. I am very concerned about this. I love my colleagues, and I know their hearts are in the right place, but I am convinced we should not be heading in this direction at this time. Make no mistake, Federal prisons are not filled with low-level, nonviolent drug possessors. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 99.7 percent of drug offenders in Federal prison at the end of fiscal year 2012 were convicted of drug trafficking offenses, not drug possession. Drug trafficking is inherently violent activity, and it only serves to fund the drug cartels while fueling violence in our cities. According to the FBI, violent crime overall increased across the United States during the first half of 2015, by 6.2 percent for murders and 17 percent in the larger cities for murder--the largest single-year increase since at least 1960. Already this year, homicides in Chicago are double what they were all of last year. This is a complex subject. It is too soon to know the total reason for this increase, but it cannot go unnoticed that over the last decade the Sentencing Commission, which sets standards for sentencing in the United States--outside of the minimum mandatories that are set by our law passed by Congress--has unilaterally imposed reductions in the sentences for drug inmates currently in prison. So we reduced the sentences for those in prison and they are getting out earlier. The most recent reduction in sentences resulted in the release of more than 46,000 drug traffickers--not drug possessors, drug traffickers--which has been wholeheartedly supported by the Obama administration. According to Bureau of Justice Statistics, 77 percent of drug offenders released were rearrested within 5 years. Hear this now: 77 percent of these drug offenders were rearrested within 5 years, with 25 percent of those rearrested being rearrested for a violent crime-- somebody hurt, maybe dead. Maybe that is part of the murder rate increase. Take Wendell Callahan, a Federal drug felon who was convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine and released early pursuant to the Sentencing Commission's directives. Upon his early release, he proceeded to brutally murder his ex-girlfriend and her two little girls, 7 and 10. He would have been deep into a 12\1/2\-year Federal sentence if it had been maintained, but the Sentencing Commission reduced it. The judge granted his petition for early release because of his ``good behavior'' in prison, and that led the judge to conclude he did not pose a danger to the safety of the public, even though in his background--when he was convicted and got the 12 years, he had previously been convicted in connection with a shooting offense and another drug offense. This is why you have to have some controls on judges. I have been there, and I saw it before the sentencing guidelines were passed. The Federal prison population is at its lowest level since 2008. We are already on a downward course of the drug Federal prison population being reduced. There are only 160,000 inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody today, well below its peak. The Bureau of Prisons has stated that this ``downward population trend is expected to continue into Fiscal Year 2017,'' bringing the Federal prisons population to the lowest level since 2005. The population is up. Crime is going up. The prison population is falling rather rapidly. Admissions to Federal prison have declined every year since 2011. You hear: We are filling our prisons. We are doing more and more. Actually, there are other things that are already happening. It is happening in State prisons, too, where larger numbers are incarcerated than in the Federal prisons. One of the reasons we are having this large decline in State prisons is not public safety but tight budgets. They are cutting back on the prison population to save money. We can be smarter. Some people can be released early. I worked with my Democratic colleague, Senator Durbin, 6 years ago, I believe, and we reduced the crack penalties more significantly than a lot of people know. I thought that was justified. But we are now proceeding well beyond that, and it is causing me great concern. The Attorney General has ordered the prosecutors to not charge certain criminal offenses. Reducing sentences and releasing felons is equivalent to reducing the cost to the criminal enterprise of their criminal activity. It reduces the cost, the risk. Thus, crime--it is already rising--would further increase as a result of the criminal justice ``reform'' bill that would further reduce penalties. Can we take a breath, and let's think about this? I don't say there aren't some things we can do that will allow for some reduction in the Federal prison population. Some people probably serve more time than is absolutely necessary. But in truth, we have seen dramatic improvements over nearly 30 years, 25 years, in the reduction of crime. Until this surge, murder rates were less than half what they were in 1980 when I became a Federal prosecutor. Drug use dropped dramatically [[Page S1308]] when Nancy Reagan started the ``Just Say No'' program, and drug use began to steadily decrease. It is now beginning to steadily increase. You have to have leadership from Washington. You can't have the President of the United States of America talking about marijuana like it is no different than taking a drink, saying I used marijuana when I was in high school and it is no different than smoking. It is different. And you are sending a message to young people that there is no danger in this process. It is false that marijuana use doesn't lead people to more drug use. It is already causing a disturbance in the States that have made it legal. I think we need to be careful about this. What if this is the beginning of another surge in drug use like we saw in the sixties and seventies that led to massive problems in our communities? The solution? Well, we have to control the border. All the heroin and a big chunk of the methamphetamine is coming across the Mexican border. We need barriers. We need more agents. People need to be arrested. They need to be deported. They don't get to be taken to some city in the United States they would like to go to and get released and asked to show up on bail, which they never do. That is an open invitation to illegality and illegal entry. We need to enforce our laws, and we have to make the consequences of drug trafficking a deterrent. We can do this. We have done it before, and it is all part and parcel with prevention programs, education programs, and treatment programs. All that has to be done, but it cannot be denied, in my opinion, that law enforcement plays a critical role in it. This means supporting, not blocking the efforts of law enforcement to do their jobs and giving them the tools to arrest drug traffickers and be effective at the border, putting them in jail, not giving them early release so they can commit more crimes. In January, a woman from Ohio named Tonda DaRe testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic. She shared the powerful story of her daughter, who died from a heroin overdose. She said this: One of the things that I see happening in our little town that frustrates me is . . . our officers have worked so diligently to arrest people that they know are bringing this [heroin] in. Just [to] have them go in front of our judges and our judges just slapped these people on the wrist and sent them right back out the door. . . . The boy that sold my daughter the heroin that killed her just recently went back in front of a judge for his fourth offense for trafficking heroin. [It was the] fourth time he's been arrested for this and he was given five months. How [is] that possible? We can talk about making sure we have treatment and recovery for people who have been addicted, although many people never ever recover from addiction--except by the grave. That is the sad truth. We should make that a priority. But we cannot hope to solve these problems by only treating people on the back end of addiction without reducing the availability of those drugs and keeping the purity down and the cost up, not continuing to fall. We have to stop people from becoming addicts in the first place, and we can't let the fact that we have a heroin abuse epidemic cause us to forget that we have a drug trafficking epidemic too. Law enforcement is prevention. Experts tell us that the price, purity, and availability of drugs, especially heroin, fuels more consumption, more addiction, more crime, more death, and more human and family destruction. I wish it were not true. I wish there were more options, but law enforcement is a central part of this effort, and history proves it. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. 51st Anniversary of Bloody Sunday Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is the 51st anniversary of Bloody Sunday--a horrible abuse of American citizens that occurred in Selma, AL. Each year we commemorate the events of that fateful day, because it helped transform our Nation and proved to be a catalyst for the passage of the Voting Rights Act. For the last two years, this commemoration has been a sad reminder of what five justices did to that cornerstone civil rights law. In Shelby County v. Holder a narrow majority of the Court drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act when it struck down the coverage formula for its preclearance provision in Section 5. I mentioned that because under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the Federal Government has the authority to examine and prevent racially discriminatory voting changes from going into effect before those changes disenfranchise voters in covered jurisdictions. By striking down the coverage formula that determined which States and jurisdictions were subject to Federal review, the Court rendered Section 5 unenforceable. Unfortunately, even though almost every single Republican and Democrat in the House and Senate voted for the Voting Rights Act, the Supreme Court, by a 1-vote margin--notwithstanding that 535 of us had voted--drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act by striking down the coverage formula for its preclearance provisions in Section 5. Since then Republican Governors and State legislatures have exploited Shelby County by enacting sweeping voter suppression laws that disproportionately prevent or discourage black Americans from voting. This includes the State of Alabama, which not only enacted a burdensome photo identification law after the decision, but then they made it even harder for many of its black citizens to obtain identification when the State closed more than 30 DMV offices in mostly poor, minority neighborhoods last October. It is hard to fathom that in 2016, well over 100 years after the Civil War and passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, and after transformative moments, such as Bloody Sunday, that States would continue to pass laws and take actions that would undermine black Americans' rights to vote. This past weekend, Congresswoman Terri Sewell, who represents the 7th District of Alabama--which includes Shelby County, Birmingham, and Selma--held a public forum in Birmingham to examine the harm caused by the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision. Several witnesses at that forum testified that the State had made it harder for their citizens to vote, and that a disproportionate number of those citizens were minorities. They also spoke about the urgent need to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act. Congressman John Lewis, our great civil rights hero, was in attendance, and it is heartbreaking to realize that so many of the gains that he was able to help secure through his civil rights activism are being undone today. Despite the compelling testimony about the urgent need for Congress to address voting rights, most Republicans in Congress continue to disregard the urgency of this issue. More than two and a half years since the Shelby County decision, and despite the introduction of two separate bipartisan bills that would restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act, the Republican chairs of the Judiciary Committee from both houses of Congress refuse to even hold a hearing on this issue. Instead, Republican leaders have only paid lip service to the issue, supporting the award of congressional medals for brave civil rights leaders. That is not enough. Recently, the Speaker of the House stated that he was supportive of one of the bipartisan voting rights restoration bills. In the same statement he explained that nothing could be done because the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee refuses to take up the bill or to have a hearing. This is not leadership. The American people expect more than talk. This pattern of Republican obstruction reached unprecedented heights recently when a few Senate Republicans declared that they would not even hold a hearing for the next Supreme Court nominee even before the President has even announced a nominee. Republicans have apparently decided that rather than be transparent and hold public hearings and votes on the most significant issues of the day--including voting rights, comprehensive immigration reform, and the next Supreme Court nominee--they would simply shut down the process. Instead they are making important and timely decisions affecting hundreds of millions of Americans behind closed doors. It is [[Page S1309]] not good for our democracy and it is not good for the American people. We need hearings and a vote on the voting rights bills. And we need a hearing and a vote on the next Supreme Court nominee. We remember what came to be known as Bloody Sunday because the blood that was shed led to greater democratic participation and a more inclusive union. What Republicans are doing now undermines the hard-fought legacy of Bloody Sunday and the Civil Rights Movement. For the good of the Nation, I urge that Republican leaders in the Senate and the House change that shameful course. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to bring us one step closer to passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act or CARA. Last week I suggested that we stay in session and do our job on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday so we could finish the bill, but I understand the Republican leadership wanted to take a long weekend, so we did not finish it, but now we can. I am a cosponsor of this bill because it addresses the growing problem of prescription opioid and heroin addiction that has had devastating impacts on communities all over the country, including my home State of Vermont. This bill represents an important shift in the way we approach the issue of substance abuse and addiction. It sets a comprehensive framework to reduce opioid deaths, prevent addiction, and improve treatment. It will also help those who suffer from opioid use disorders achieve recovery, and perhaps most importantly this bill reflects the consensus of this body that the Nation cannot arrest or jail its way out of this addiction problem. Since my first field hearing in Rutland, VT, on this topic in 2008, I have been inspired by how my fellow Vermonters across the political spectrum have shaped the discussion about this public health crisis and how they have served as a model for communities across the Nation. I certainly feel this bill represents important progress, but we cannot be satisfied with just passing this one bill. We also need a significant commitment of targeted funding so we can carry out and implement the programs authorized by this bill. It is one thing to say we are going to authorize these great programs even though we are not going to pay for them, but don't you feel good that we authorized them. Now we can all go home and tell our constituents we care. We authorized it, but we will not pay for it. At least Senator Shaheen stood and proposed an amendment that would have provided emergency funding to do just that. Her vital amendment had the support of a majority in this body, but Republican Senators blocked it from being considered and adopted. It is unfortunate because Senator Shaheen's amendment would have provided the resources to strengthen both the law enforcement and public health components that would have delivered the necessary resources to health care professionals all over the country who are overwhelmed by a need they cannot meet. I believe there is bipartisan agreement that we have to stop the loss of life caused by opioid abuse. There should be a bipartisan agreement to provide the money necessary to do so. There is an opportunity to make the bill better. Many Members have filed amendments to improve CARA. A number of amendments were filed by both Republicans and Democrats. Unfortunately, the Republican leader has not allowed us to have an open amendment process, and contrary to what he said earlier, a number of Senators have been blocked from offering their amendments. I tried to work--and did in a bipartisan way with Senators Grassley, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar--to consider this bill and report it to the Senate floor. We have continued our bipartisan effort to reach agreement on a number of amendments that could improve the bill. I hope those important bipartisan efforts will continue this week so we can consider these amendments and have final passage this week. Let us have an open process. These amendments can be voted on up or down or adopted by consent. It is one thing for us to talk about what we want to do, it is another thing to have the courage to vote for it. If we do not vote for it, we are just voting maybe. Let us vote yes or no. As we work toward Senate passage of CARA, our goal should be to make this the best bill possible. Addiction is nothing less than an epidemic and CARA treats it like one. This bill demonstrates that Congress now sees addiction for what it is--a public health crisis all over our country. We need to equip our communities with both the programs and resources they need to get ahead of addiction. CARA will save lives. It is worth putting the money in there to make sure it works. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia on the floor, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the senior Senator from Vermont, who is a dear friend of mine. As he knows, this is a problem. It is an epidemic all over this country. No State is immune from it. It doesn't matter whether you are a Democrat or Republican. It has no home. It attacks and literally eradicates all of us, and it causes extreme hardships for all the families. I know the Presiding Officer, who is from Indiana, is aware of this problem. Every week I have come to the floor to read letters from people who have been affected by addiction in West Virginia and other States. I have a letter from the Presiding Officer's home State of Indiana, and I have a letter from my State too. This is something we have been fighting. The CARA Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It is not going to be a cure-all, but it starts in the right direction for us to start looking at opioid addiction and prescription drug abuse, not as much as we have in the past as a crime but as an illness, and an illness needs to have treatment. I think we are moving in that direction. Politically we are accepting this, and we are going to basically meet that need of treatment which is so few and far between. We have 51 people dying every day. In my little, beautiful State of West Virginia, just last year we lost over 600 lives to prescription drug abuse, and I have a State with less than 2 million people. From 1999 to 2013 there has been an increase of over 700 percent. This is a product which has come on the market that is greater than anything we have ever seen. We hope the FDA gets serious about this. They are hearing us loud and clear. Dr. Califf was not someone whom I supported. I am very hopeful he will do a great job, and I will support him. He needs to step up to the plate and change the culture of the FDA. The reason I say that is because the FDA has to take their role seriously and not just approve drugs because it meets a certain criteria but also needs to realize the impact it has on the well-being of the families who have been addicted and affected. They need to consider the devastating public health impacts of its repeated decisions to approve all of these drugs that don't need to be on the market. We are very hopeful for that. The thing that brings that to mind is that it took us forever to get Vicodin and Lortab from a schedule III to a schedule II. It took us over 3 years. Once we did, it took about 1 billion pills off the market, which resulted in a 22-percent decrease in Vicodin and Lortab, which were being passed out like M&Ms. We know it can save lives. Yet they came right back with Zohydro, which was against the wishes of their advisory committee. We believe it is imperative that they have an advisory committee for every opioid they want to bring to the market. They must listen to the advisory committee. If the FDA--the Commissioner and his staff--wishes to go ahead and put a product on the market that is recommended not to be on the market from their advisory committee, they should come before us in Congress and tell us why they believe this potent drug such as Zohydro is needed when it is against the recommendations of these experts and specialists. We have been flooded with these stories. I will read a story from the Presiding Officer's State of Indiana first. [[Page S1310]] The girl's name is Danielle. She says: I live in Southern Indiana and work as a server. About 2\1/2\ years ago a customer by the name of Josh Harvey left me his number. At the time, he told me he was living in Chicago for school. Little did I know he was in rehab there. Granted, I didn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in constant contact. About a year or so ago I found out about his heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know it started out with prescription pills and later went into heroin when the pills became harder to get. He served a month in jail in Michigan, for the entire month of this past July, over a heroin-related charge. He came home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. Luckily, his dad saved him that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient program doing better--or so we all thought. School let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came to me on November 4 telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. I suggested an inpatient program. He went to Wellstone after he left my house, sat for several hours and finally was given a room. I went and checked on him two different times while he waited to make sure he was there. Thursday I didn't receive any calls. Friday nothing either. Then, Saturday morning, the 7th of November, his mother called me to break my heart. He had passed away that Friday the 6th over in Louisville and they didn't know who to contact until that Saturday morning, I guess. He had checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into his house, and took his Xbox, which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. Never in a million years did I think I would become close to anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn't discriminate. It can get a hold of anyone and everybody. Never in my life have I been so depressed or heartbroken. All I want is his story shared. He was my happy ending gone way too soon. That was from our friend in Indiana who wanted to share her story with us. Let me tell you about Amanda, who lives in West Virginia. Amanda said: I walked into our new apartment. Although we had only spent 2 nights there, it already felt like home. I was so excited to move in with Nate. We had been on the fence between being best friends and a couple, and making the decision to move in together had finally settled years of uncertainty. As I turned the corner, I was surprised to see that he was in the exact same position as when I had left for my morning classes. I knew it had been a rough night of ``partying,'' but I thought he would be up to start our busy day of painting and moving. I touched his chest to feel the rise and fall, something that, as a mother, I had been doing to sleeping children for years. There was movement. He was breathing. I breathed a quick sigh of relief. I walked to the back of the apartment to set down my things, and that is when I realized I needed to go and get some things from my old apartment, and I started to leave. My hand was on the doorknob, but something stopped me in my tracks. To this day, I don't know why I turned around. I laid down beside Nate, and I put my arm on his chest. He was not breathing, and when I looked up at his face, his eyes were wide open, but it was obvious that he was not there. The paramedics revived him to the point that he survived in a coma for 1 week. At one point while in the hospital, his eyes opened, and I thought that our nightmare was over, but it was just a muscle reflex and false hope. On January 30, 2007, prescription drugs took the life of Nathan Keith Dunn, age 24. Tall, dark, and handsome is what the world saw. Intelligent, funny, witty, loving, and kind were the qualities seen by those who knew Nate best. He was my best friend, my musical soulmate, and my sounding board. We were inseparable, and I began to experience an ache in my heart that, 9 years later, still occasionally brings me to my knees. But that is just who Nate was to me. He was also the older son of a mother who had left years of abuse at the hands of her husband in order to find a better life for her sons. He was the brother to--and the only soft spot of--a boy who had been hardened growing up on the streets of a town outside of Houston, TX. It seemed as if the only thing that ever kept him grounded was Nate's love. They had one another's back in the best and worst of times. Nate was also the instant crush of any girl who ever laid her eyes upon him. He was the best friend of anyone who knew him. I often wonder who and where he would be today. But I guess I will just have to wonder forever. I wish this was the end of my story about how prescription drugs have affected my life, but it is not even close to the end. For longer than I care to admit, drugs have been part of my everyday life. Shortly after Nate's death, I became addicted to prescription opiates. At first, they were prescribed by my doctor. Eventually, I couldn't get through a day without them. I was what is sometimes referred to as a ``functioning addict,'' although it is fair to say that such a thing does not exist. To the outside world, I appeared to be fine, normal even. I held a job. I cared for my young sons. I kept a tidy home. Meanwhile, my tolerance was building, and I began to require more and more of the drugs just to feel normal, just to get through each day. Can you imagine living this life in which you wake up each day wondering if you have enough of the drug you need just to be OK for that day? So many people are facing this every single day. It could be the person sitting next to you. It could be your child's teacher. Even worse, it could be your own child. The first thing to suffer was my financial situation. Every dime I had was spent on the drugs that would allow me to function today, tomorrow, and if I am lucky, the next. Then, my relationships with friends and family began to fail. It was painfully obvious that I was stealing from them. Next, I couldn't keep a job--a record that will haunt me for the rest of my life. How could I go to work? How could I continue on? Then, a catalyst walked into my life. I met a very good man. As we became closer, I realized that I couldn't bring myself to tell him that I was a drug addict. This is a silent killer. Nobody speaks; they all keep it very quiet. Mr. President, if I may have about 1 minute to finish up, I would appreciate it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Mr. President. Very few people know what is actually happening in your life. In order to get help, you have to be willing to openly talk about your issues, and most of us fear being harshly judged--and rightfully so. Trying to treat a person with addiction issues by using medication only or therapy only is like trying to extinguish a raging house fire with a garden hose. She said: I was fortunate enough to have found a medication-based treatment program in my area, which is paid for by my insurance. She is going to move forward, and she wanted this story to be told. She said she wanted people to know how difficult it is. What we need to know as policymakers is how hard it is for people in our States who realize they need help and can't find it. So what I ask all of us to do--this CARA bill is a step in the right direction. It is a piece of legislation that is much needed. As we move forward today on this piece of legislation, I hope we will find basically the support that people are needing to fight this opiate addiction. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment No. 3378, the substitute amendment to S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, Deb Fischer, John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito, Roy Blunt, Johnny Isakson, John Boozman, Mike Crapo, David Vitter, Mike Rounds, Bill Cassidy, James [[Page S1311]] E. Risch, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Thom Tillis, Orrin G. Hatch. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on amendment No. 3378, as amended, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, to S. 524, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 86, nays 3, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 32 Leg.] YEAS--86 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Booker Boozman Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Manchin McCain McConnell Menendez Merkley Moran Murphy Murray Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--3 Lee Markey Sasse NOT VOTING--11 Boxer Carper Cruz McCaskill Mikulski Murkowski Nelson Rubio Sanders Toomey Vitter The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 86, the nays are 3. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, that is good news. The Presiding Officer just announced the results of the vote, and that is good news because it means the Senate has just taken another step toward the passage of CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I see my colleague Senator Whitehouse is on the floor. I thank him and thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving forward on this legislation that will help us to save friends, family members, our neighbors, and communities that are struggling with addiction. This is a very important opportunity for us to be able to move forward on legislation that is comprehensive, that is bipartisan, and that has a companion bill on the House side, so there is a very good chance we could get this to the President's desk. It is the only bipartisan legislation that is comprehensive and evidence based, and it is critical we move forward with it. In addition to Senator Whitehouse, I also thank Senator Ayotte, Senator Klobuchar, and 42 bipartisan cosponsors for their support. Frankly, more important to me is the support around the country this legislation has. I think Senator Whitehouse and I now have over 130 groups around the country that are supporting this legislation. This includes doctors, nurses, health care professionals, also law enforcement, people who are in the trenches dealing every day with treatment and recovery, and those who are focused on prevention and how to ensure people cannot just be treated for addiction but try to keep people out of the funnel of addiction. We started working on this legislation about 3 years ago. We started by hearing from experts around the country. We had five conferences in Washington where we looked at all the issues, including criminal justice, women and addiction, the science of addiction, youth prevention, recovery issues, substance abuse impacting our veterans--a number of issues that enabled us to write legislation that actually makes sense, that will make a difference in our communities. These 130 groups around the country are focused on getting this bill passed because they know it is going to make a difference in our communities. If enacted, this will help States and communities develop and implement these evidence-based practices that we have looked at from around the country. It expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent prescription opioid abuse and the use of heroin and increases drug disposal sites to keep medications out of the hands of youth. It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamine and expands the availability of the overdose reversal drugs such as naloxone, which are miracle drugs. It provides not just naloxone but also more training to our law enforcement officials, to firefighters, and to other emergency responders. In the criminal justice system, CARA will help promptly identify and treat individuals suffering from substance abuse and expand diversion and education efforts to give individuals a second chance. Frankly, it is going to help to get people into treatment rather than going into the criminal justice system. Locking up people hasn't worked. If people are being arrested for possession alone, for using, this legislation will help to divert those people into the treatment to get them back on their feet. CARA also authorizes resources to expand treatment in general, including medication-assisted treatment--again based on the research that has been done around the country. It allows veterans who were discharged for a substance abuse disorder to use drug courts as they recover. So it provides actual grants to these veterans treatment courts. They are doing a terrific job. I have toured these in Ohio and talked to some of these veterans who have been through these programs. Again, it helps get our veterans back on the right track. Rather than ending in jail, they end up in a treatment program with other veterans helping them and supporting them, where they can begin to deal with their addiction and mental health issues. CARA supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. This happens now at our colleges and universities increasingly. We want to support that. It also creates a task force on recovery to improve ways to address the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. One of the most important aspects of this legislation expands drug treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, babies who are born with addiction. Recently, my wife Jane and I visited Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, OH. We toured the neonatal unit. If you haven't done this, it will break your heart because you will find there an increasing number of babies who are born, again, with this addiction, the neonatal abstinence syndrome. Unfortunately, when you look at what has happened in Ohio, we have had a 750-percent increase in the number of babies who are diagnosed with this neonatal abstinence syndrome just since 2004--a 750-percent increase. I am told in some of our States now 10 percent of the babies are being born addicted. I have also been at other hospitals around our State, including Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and St. Rita's Special Care Nursery in Lima, OH. Last week my wife went to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus. Every single one of these children's hospitals is experiencing the same thing. What I have learned from these incredibly compassionate nurses and doctors who take these newborns [[Page S1312]] through a withdrawal process is that the numbers of babies who have been exposed to heroin or prescription drugs continue to grow. The problem is getting worse, not better. These hospitals serve as yet another reminder that addiction is a disease. It is a disease that has to be treated like other diseases, and it is a disease that can impact anyone. It is wonderful that these caring nurses, doctors, and others are working to try to ensure that these babies become healthy. We don't know what the long-term consequences are, but we need to do more to avoid the addiction in the first place and better treat it when it occurs, and that is what this legislation does. Specifically, the measure takes steps to help women and babies by expanding treatment for expectant and postpartum women and authorizing the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to ensure that these women have access to evidence-based treatment services. That is in this legislation. It also reauthorizes residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction. There is a great center in Columbus, OH, called Amethyst. I had the opportunity to visit it. It is a treatment center, and the average length of stay there is almost 2 years. Their results are unbelievable. They allow women to come with their babies, with their children, to go through treatment together. So there is hope. There are treatment centers doing a great job. We want to hold those up and encourage more of that around the country. Finally, the legislation also creates a pilot program for State substance abuse agencies that allows funds to be used to target women who are addicted to opioids and provide family-based services to those women in nonresidential settings. So it helps on the residential side but also with the nonresidential outpatient side. Helping these women and helping these babies is just one aspect of this bill, but it is a very critical one. As we work to turn the tide in the struggle against addiction, it is one on which we should all be focused. The good news is that the bipartisan momentum we have seen here tonight is building. I think the Senate is ready to move on this legislation this week. There are other amendments that have been filed. The deadline was today. I hope we will have the opportunity to go through some more amendments, as we did last week, but meanwhile, we have strong support and strong momentum, as we saw tonight, on both sides of the aisle. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have lined up to support this legislation. We need to pass this bill and get it signed into law so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives of people we represent. As the heroin epidemic in Ohio and around the country has reached crisis level, I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill over the finish line here in the Senate and then get it passed in the House, where there is companion legislation, and then on to the President's desk and enable this Congress to play a role as a better partner with State and local governments and with our nonprofits around this country to address this growing heroin epidemic around our entire country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Miners Protection Act Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last week I met with Rita Lewis of Westchester, OH, in southwest Ohio. She was here to testify in front of the Senate Committee on Finance in honor of her late husband Butch. Butch worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. I would also add that Butch had been drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates to play baseball some 45 years ago. Instead, he enlisted to go into the U.S. Army and on to Vietnam. He was injured and could never play baseball again competitively. He came back and became a trucker and joined the Teamsters. As I said, he worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. But for Butch and Rita and thousands more Ohio retirees, that promise is under threat. Truckers and mine workers in Ohio and across the country are facing crippling cuts to the benefits they have earned. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act that Congress passed 2 years ago allows pension trustees to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of retirees when a plan is running low on funds. This is disgraceful. If a pension fund is in bad shape, it is our job to fix it, not break promises to American workers who have worked their whole lives to earn that pension. I believed that 2 years ago when I voted against that law which allowed these proposed cuts, and I believe it more strongly now. That is why I am calling on the Treasury Department to reject and to reject immediately the proposed cuts to the Central States Teamsters' pension. I am calling for us to immediately mark up and pass the Miners Protection Act, which will protect the benefits Ohio workers earned over a lifetime of work. Under MEPRA, the bill I talked about a moment ago, multiemployer pension trustees such as Central States are now able to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of participants and retirees if the plans are in ``critical and declining status.'' Pension trustees for plans in ``critical and declining status'' may submit an application for proposed benefit cuts to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Central States pension plan trustees used the authority of MEPRA to propose cuts of as much as 70 percent, but in their own application, they admit that even with these drastic cuts, their plan--get this-- still only has a 50.4-percent chance of remaining solvent. In other words, they are asking Treasury to approve massive, life-shattering cuts to hundreds of thousands of workers for what amounts to a coin flip. Treasury should immediately reject this application. Put yourself--this is something we don't do well around here--put yourself in the place of a worker who has planned for her retirement with her family. She expected a $2,000-a-month pension on top of $1,200 a month in Social Security, and she all of a sudden finds out her pension is cut 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent. That was the money she planned to live on. She has some savings, but all that was calculated because it was a promise from this pension plan to honor that commitment of decades earlier. As I said, Treasury should immediately reject this application. The mine workers' pension plan and the others are too far gone to use MEPRA. The United Mine Workers of America's 1974 pension plan covers 100,000 mine workers, including thousands of miners in eastern and southern Ohio. It was almost completely funded before the financial collapse of 7 years ago brought on by Wall Street overreach and greed, but the plan was devastated by the recession. It has too few assets, too few employers, and too few union workers paying in. If Congress fails to act, thousands of retired miners could lose their health care this year and the entire plan could fail as early as next year. There is a bipartisan solution that is proposed by Senator Manchin, Senator Casey, me, and others and supported by leaders of both parties. If it were brought to the floor today, it would pass with an overwhelming majority. It is time for the Senate to act. The Committee on Finance should mark up this legislation this week. The Senate should bring it to the floor immediately. Miners worked in dangerous jobs--dangers from a mining accident, an explosion, or a collapse every day when they went to work, and dangerous in the sense that so many mine workers die early because of premature bronchial illnesses and heart ailments brought on by working in the mines. They have worked underground their whole lives to put food on the table, to send their kids to school, and to help power this country. Truckers criss-cross the State and country to pay their bills and support their families and drive our economy forward. They all deserve the full pension and health benefits they were promised and they worked a lifetime to earn. Butch Lewis led the Southwest Retirees Pension Committee's fight against cuts to their earned benefits. He passed away on New Year's Eve due to a stroke, which doctors have attributed [[Page S1313]] at least in part to the stress he faced over the proposed pension cuts not just to him and his family but to the workers he was fighting for as a union activist. The benefits to his widow, his wife Rita, have already been cut. She faces an additional 40-percent reduction because of the proposed cuts put forth by Central States. Butch said the cuts being forced on retirees--his words--``amount to a war against the middle class and the American dream.'' He is right. Ohio's retired workers have earned their pensions and their retirement savings over a lifetime of hard work. It was promised to them, whether they worked behind a desk, on the factory floor, down in the coal mines, or behind a wheel. We should honor Butch's memory by continuing his work. That means coming together to support a bipartisan solution to protect Rita's benefits and the pensions of tens of thousands of retired Teamsters and retired mine workers. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1303-S1313] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2015 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 524, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 524) to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Pending: Grassley amendment No. 3378, in the nature of a substitute. Grassley (for Donnelly/Capito) modified amendment No. 3374 (to amendment No. 3378), to provide follow-up services to individuals who have received opioid overdose reversal drugs. Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, before I begin, as we discuss the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Whitehouse for his role in developing the bill and bringing it this far. I also convey my gratitude to Minority Leader Reid and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for their excellent staffs and for urging that my amendments--which I will address momentarily--be a part of the discussion and for managing the negotiations on this bill. I also thank Senator Murray, the ranking member of the HELP Committee, for help and counsel on amendments. Let us pause for a moment and consider the causes of the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic gripping our country. Understanding the causes will help us focus on the right solutions. Three distinct parties bear much of the blame for this public health crisis. First, there is Big Pharma. In the mid-1990s, the seeds of this epidemic [[Page S1304]] were planted with the aggressive, misleading, and ultimately criminal marketing of the powerful opioid painkiller, OxyContin by Purdue Pharma. Perdue claimed OxyContin was not addictive and couldn't be abused. Neither of those claims turned out to be true. Purdue Pharma built a massive marketing and sales program for OxyContin. From 1996 to 2000, Purdue Pharma's sales force more than doubled from more than 300 sales representatives to almost 700 sales representatives. In 2001 alone, Purdue gave out $40 million in bonuses to its burgeoning sales force. As a result of these sales and marketing efforts, from 1997 to 2002, OxyContin prescriptions increased almost tenfold, from 670,000 in 1997 to 6.2 million in 2002. Purdue's marketing of OxyContin broke the law. In 2007, Purdue Pharma paid $600 million in fines and other payments after pleading guilty in Federal court to misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the risks of addiction to OxyContin and its potential for abuse. Second, Purdue Pharma's criminal wrongdoing did not occur in a vacuum. The Federal Government helped to enable this epidemic. The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration is responsible for approving the annual production quotas for pharmaceutical companies to manufacture oxycodone, the principal ingredient in OxyContin. From 1996 to 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration obliged Big Pharma and increased by almost 150 percent the amount of oxycodone authorized for manufacture. In 1996, the DEA authorized U.S. pharmaceutical companies to make the equivalent of 6 billion 10-milligram OxyContin pills. By 2016, that figure had increased to almost 14 billion 10-milligram pills. That is right. Today the Drug Enforcement Administration is telling Big Pharma it is OK to make 14 billion OxyContin pills to sell in the United States in 1 year. The Federal Food and Drug Administration was also complicit, approving new opioid after new opioid. In the process, the FDA, charged with ensuring the safety of all prescription drugs on the U.S. market, began turning a blind eye to outside experts who were warning of the dangers these drugs posed. In 2013, an expert panel established to review the powerful new opioid painkiller Zohydro, voted 11 to 2 against recommending its approval, but the FDA approved the drug anyway, overruling the concerns voiced by experienced physicians on the panel. In 2014, in the wake of the Zohydro decision, the FDA twice skipped the advisory committee process altogether when it approved two new prescription opioids. Then, in August of 2015, the FDA did it again. This time it bypassed an advisory committee of outside experts on the question of a new use for OxyContin for children aged 11 to 16. The FDA even ignored its own rules that specifically call for advisory committee advice when a committee of pediatric dosing is involved. It was clear that the FDA was intentionally choosing to forgo advisory committees in order to avoid another overwhelming Zohydro-like vote, recommending against approval of a prescription opioid and in order to avoid any impediments to new opioids being sold in the United States. Finally, the medical profession must bear its fair share of responsibility for this crisis. Doctors are prescribing opioids at an alarming rate. In 2012, America's doctors wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain relievers, enough pills for every single American adult to have a bottle of opioid pills given to them in the year 2012. And America's doctors are dangerously uninformed about the drugs they are prescribing. A recent survey of 1,000 physicians nationwide found that ``only two-thirds correctly reported that the most common route of abuse was swallowing pills whole.'' It is unconscionable that our doctors are so ill-informed. Nearly half of the doctors surveyed also erroneously reported that so-called abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids were less addictive than their counterparts. Abuse-deterrent opioids are supposed to be harder to crush, so they are harder to snort or to mix with liquid and inject, but abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids are just as addictive as non-abuse-deterrent opioids. Whether an opioid is abuse-deterrent or not hasn't prevented tens of thousands of people who have had their wisdom teeth removed or experienced lower back pain from getting addicted to these painkillers simply by swallowing them. So what is the result of the combination of Big Pharma's marketing of prescription opioids, the Federal Government's repeatedly approving them in ever-increasing numbers, and our doctors writing millions of prescriptions for them? Today, the United States is less than 5 percent of the world's population but we consume 80 percent of the world's opioid painkillers. We have become the United States of Oxy. When prescriptions run out or the price of Oxy pills on the street become too high for those who have become addicted, they turn to cheaper heroin, which shares the same molecular structure as OxyContin. Eighty percent of the people suffering from heroin addiction started with opioid pain medications approved by the FDA and prescribed by doctors. In 2014, nearly 33,000 people died of an opioid overdose in this country. Almost 1,300 of those deaths were in my home State of Massachusetts. I had hoped to offer amendments to CARA to address both the causes of this epidemic and to provide treatment for those suffering from the results. One of my amendments would have required the FDA to convene advisory committees for all prescription opioid approval questions. After I placed a hold on the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf to serve as FDA Commissioner, the agency announced it would only commit to convene advisory committees for non-abuse-deterrent opioids. The FDA refused to agree to convene advisory committees to inform all of its opioid-approval decisions. We need legislation requiring the FDA to seek expert advice about the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids, and I will continue to fight to require advisory committees at the FDA. We also need legislation requiring doctors to get and stay educated about the dangers of the pills they are prescribing in record numbers. Stopping the overprescription of opioid painkillers is a critical step. We need to ensure that all prescribers of these opioid painkillers are educated in the dangers of these drugs, how easily individuals can become addicted, and when and how to appropriately prescribe. The doctors say that they do not want education to be mandated, that it should be voluntary. Well, the FDA has had voluntary education for opioid prescribers in place since 2013 and has been actively encouraging doctors to take these voluntary education programs, but in more than 2 years, only 12 percent of prescribers have actually completed FDA's voluntary education program. It is imperative that any provider who is applying for a Federal DEA license to prescribe opioids have completed mandatory education on the basics of opioid prescribing and the inherent risk of addiction. My amendment would have done just that. It would have required basic education as a condition of a DEA license to prescribe these painkillers, and I will continue to fight to require prescriber education. Finally, we need to remove the barriers to effective treatment, including outdated Federal restrictions on medication-assisted therapies such as Suboxone. Medication-assisted therapy for opioid addiction is cost effective, decreases overdose deaths, and reduces transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. Unlike other treatment regimens for any other disease, physicians are severely limited in the number of patients they can treat with medication-assisted therapies such as Suboxone, contributing to long wait-lists and an inability of patients to get treatment for their addiction when they need it. Of approximately 2.5 million Americans who abused or were dependent on opioids, fewer than 1 million received treatment for their condition, partly because of the already existing Federal instructions. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and I have a bipartisan bill, the Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act, or TREAT Act, which has broad stakeholder support, including the American Medical Association and nurse practitioners. It emphasizes quality of care and closes this gaping [[Page S1305]] hole in our addiction treatment system. We had hoped to offer TREAT as an amendment to CARA. We will continue to fight for it and are hopeful the HELP Committee will include it in the substance abuse legislation the committee will soon consider. My collaboration with Senator Paul shows that whether it is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the Commonwealth of Kentucky, this crisis is the same. It doesn't discriminate by geography, by age, by race, by socioeconomic status, or by employment. It requires a bipartisan effort. Thirty years ago, Nancy Reagan told us to just say no to drugs. Today we have to go further. We have to say enough is enough. We have to recognize what has worked and what hasn't worked. In the past, we believed we could incarcerate our way out of the problem. That did not work. So instead of ignoring and incarcerating, let's avow and act. Let's destigmatize, not criminalize. Let's treat, not retreat. Let's have a comprehensive plan which we put in place that deals with the pharmaceutical companies, the physicians, and the kinds of treatment patients need across our country so that they get the help they need. That is our job. I continue to believe we can do this in a bipartisan fashion as long as we understand the magnitude of the problem and what the causes of it were and continue to be and will be into the future unless and until we put these safeguards in place. So I am looking forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I compliment them for the work they have done so far in bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate this week, but I do believe there is more to be done. As long as this many Americans are addicted, as long as this much OxyContin and opioids are put into our system, then we are going to find that this heroin epidemic we have in our country, which is directly related, will continue to spiral out of control. I want to work with all my colleagues. I thank my colleagues for all the work they have done so far, but there is much work to be done in the future. Madam President, I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to talk for a few minutes about the crime problem we have in America today, the dramatically increasing problem of heroin abuse. Over the last week, we have had a lot of discussion about this crisis, which I am afraid we are just on the cusp of. I think it is going to get worse, based on my experience and my best judgment, but the effort to understand and address it has been going on for a while. In January, we had a good hearing on this issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I want to mention a few things I think we ought to keep in mind as we address this very important problem. Just as background, I served 15 years as a prosecutor, 12 as a U.S. attorney, a Federal prosecutor, and 2\1/2\ as an assistant U.S. attorney. So that was my background when I came here. I was very active and studied the drug and crime problem in America, and I learned some things. There are cycles in this, and people wrote about it over the years. I think we are, unfortunately, moving into another cycle, and we have to be very careful. It is so painful to have a large prison population. We don't want to have that. Year after year, everybody wants to look for alternatives to prison, and we have tried, but if you go too far, you end up not having sufficient consequences for crime, not detaining dangerous offenders, and you end up increasing crime, increasing deaths of Americans from murders and other things, increasing heroin and serious drug problems that destroy families, destroy lives, destroy communities, and result in violence and death. It is a very real problem. A lot of people think, well, if you want to use heroin, so be it. Well, these people can't function. How are they going to survive? They either steal or they get on welfare or they have to go to treatment. And who pays for it, since they do not have any money? We have proven and seen for decades that drug use can be brought down, fewer people can become addicted. In the early 1980s, Nancy Reagan, as President Reagan's wonderful wife, formed the ``Just Say No'' program, and hundreds of thousands of volunteers nationwide in every community in America got together in their communities--they got the treatment community, the law enforcement community, the prevention community, the education community, and the schools--and they worked and worked and crafted policies that would create a climate of hostility for the use of dangerous drugs. The idea was to bring down the use. As a result, the use of illegal drugs dropped by half. It took us 15 or more years, but it dropped by half steadily. What a tremendous victory. In 1980, half of our high school seniors admitted they had used an illegal drug sometime in that year. What an unbelievable number. It had been going up steadily, it peaked, and then it began to go down under this sustained effort. What I have been worried about for some time, and have warned about it, is that if you don't maintain that but start going in the other direction, you can expect drug use to increase. It is that simple. And it is happening. Lives--and young people's lives--will be destroyed by this, families will break up, and children will be scarred. Drug use is no fun, innocent thing. It is destructive. If this Nation is using half as much illegal drugs as before, it is a better nation. It just is. And if we double the amount of drug use in America, it will be a more dangerous Nation and not as good a nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 47,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014. In 2014, 47,000 died. That is one drug overdose death for every 12 minutes. And 61 percent of those overdoses involved opioids. The rate of all opioid overdoses in the United States has tripled since 2000. Overdoses have tripled since 2000. Heroin overdose deaths specifically have increased sixfold since 2001--600 percent--and have more than tripled in just the past 4 years alone. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there were approximately 169,000 new heroin users in 2013. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 2004, approximately 589,000 people in the United States had an opioid use disorder. We used to call that addiction--a problem. It is affecting their lives. The Drug Enforcement Administration's 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment noted that ``drug overdose deaths have become the leading cause of injury death in the United States, ahead of motor vehicle deaths and firearms.'' This is a significant matter. As DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg, a bright, young mind appointed by President Obama, noted last July that ``[a]pproximately 120 people die each day in the United States of a drug overdose.'' Some argue that the increase in heroin abuse is due to over- prescription of opioids from prescription drugs--you get addicted from a prescription drug, and then you move to heroin. I am sure that has some validity, but according to a January 14, 2016, study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the premier authoritative medical journals in the world: In the majority of studies, the increase in the rates of heroin use preceded the change in prescription-opioid policies, and there is no consistent evidence of an association between the implementation of policies related to prescription opioids and increases in the rates of heroin use or deaths, although the data are relatively sparse. Alternatively, heroin market forces-- Please hear this, colleagues-- Alternatively, heroin market forces, including increased accessibility, reduced price, and high purity of heroin appear to be major drivers of the recent increases in rates of heroin use. So it is purity, price, and accessibility. While treatment and accountability are critical to breaking the cycle of addiction, it is not the whole solution. We must also reduce the availability of heroin--we simply have to do that--and other illicit opioids. In December of last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said it is important ``that law enforcement''--a lot of people don't want to talk about this. We have police officers, sheriffs' deputies, Federal agents, drug enforcement [[Page S1306]] agents, and Border Patrol agents. He said it is important ``that law enforcement intensify efforts to reduce the availability of heroin, illegal fentanyl, and other illegal opioids.'' Similarly, Drug Enforcement Administration Acting Administrator Rosenberg said in the DEA's National Drug Threat Assessment that, in addition to providing treatment to addicted opioid abusers, ``law enforcement must continue to have the tools it needs to attack criminal groups who facilitate drug addiction.'' I have been there. I was part of law enforcement's efforts. I invested a tremendous amount of my time in the Coalition for a Drug Free Mobile, the Partnership for Youth, Bay Area Drug Council--groups like that--working on a volunteer basis to change the use of drugs in the community. Law enforcement was always a critical part of it, and law enforcement does have the capability in ways that others don't to reduce the availability, make purity levels less, and otherwise restrict, raising the price of an illegal drug. The DEA's 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment confirms this. They studied the price of the drugs. One thing that tells us whether or not law enforcement and interdiction are effective is to discover if the price is going up or down. Mexican drug cartels are flooding the United States with cheap heroin and methamphetamine. When I was a young prosecutor, it was coming from Turkey, the Middle East, and that was pretty much shut off. President Carter did some good things. I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and came back a few years later as a U.S. Attorney, but during that time they somehow reduced the supply of heroin from the Middle East. As a result, heroin addiction dropped all over the country, and very little heroin was in the heartland of America--mainly just in the big cities. We are also getting cheap methamphetamine from across the Mexican border, which is wide open. The statistics from the DEA Drug Threat Assessment confirm that, from 2010 to 2014, the amount of heroin seized every year at the southwest border has more than doubled. Well, are we catching that much more? No, we are not catching, I am sure, any substantially larger percentage. We are just having a larger amount moving across the border. The price has fallen, so we know we have more. If prices stay low, more people will try it more often, and as the purity level is higher, more people will get addicted sooner and often die quicker. These drug cartels are partnering with criminal gangs and fueling violence in our cities and communities. According to DEA's 2015 Threat Assessment, Mexican drug cartels ``control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their presence in the United States, particularly in heroin markets.'' They import, transport, and are now actually selling it in our cities instead of just bringing it in across the border. In 2013, the heads of the Chicago Crime Commission and the Chicago Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration both named El Chapo Guzman, the infamous leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, as Chicago's ``Public Enemy #1.'' So a man in Mexico, moving heroin and methamphetamine into the United States and hammering Chicago with it-- Chicago named him as their No. 1 public enemy. It cannot be a coincidence, as the FBI's uniform crime statistics show, that the murder rate in Chicago increased by approximately 18 percent during the first 6 months of 2015. At that rate, it is a 36 percent increase in murders in Chicago in 1 year. This is an unbelievably dramatic surge in murders. Another example is Atlanta. DEA's Atlanta office reported an increase of heroin availability from a rating of ``stable'' in the first half of 2013 to ``high'' just a year later. According to the FBI's uniform crime statistics, the murder rate in Atlanta increased by approximately 15 percent in the first 6 months of 2015. This is an unsustainable thing. The old rule is a 7-percent increase and your money doubles in 10 years. When you get 15- and 18-percent increases in 6 months--that's 30 percent in 1 year--you are doubling the crime rate, the murder rate, in 3 years. At a November hearing of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I asked DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley about these drug distribution networks and the people in local communities pushing the drugs, selling the drugs, and collecting the money. This money eventually ends up back in Mexico, Colombia, and South and Central America, funding the evil, violent drug cartels that are destabilizing whole nations. He responded that it is ``almost as big a problem as the cartels themselves.'' When I asked him whether these drug traffickers are the ones causing the violence and death on our streets, he responded that ``they are the ones that regulate themselves by the barrel of a gun.'' If you want to collect a drug debt, you can't file a lawsuit in Federal court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun. By its very nature, drug distribution networks are violent criminals. It has always been so, and it will always be so. Conducting an illegal enterprise, they have to maintain discipline, and they use threats and violence to maintain it and collect their debts. We must not forget what became obvious in the early 1980s, when I was a U.S. Attorney: Drug dealers and their organizations are not nonviolent criminals. These are violent crimes. Rather than enforcing the law and making it tougher on drug cartels by keeping our border secure, the Obama administration has done exactly the opposite. Our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to flood our country with cheap heroin, and the administration has made it clear that officers are not to deviate from the President's lawless immigration policy. They are blocked from doing their job and following their oath. Just last week--and as someone who has worked closely with Federal Drug Enforcement officers and immigration officers as a Federal prosecutor--Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske testified before the House Committee on Appropriations that ``if you don't want to follow the directions of your superiors, including the president of the United States and the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, then you really do need to look for another job.'' Do you hear what he is saying there, colleagues? What he is saying is that if you want to do your job and enforce the laws as the laws are written, which we have ordered you not to do, and you go on and do it anyway, then look for another job. It is one of the most amazing things I have seen in my entire law enforcement career. ICE officers-- Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers--who enforce drug laws, along with immigration laws, these officers sued their supervisors. They sued their supervisors, alleging that they were being ordered to violate their oath to enforce the immigration laws of the United States by these restrictive policies. It is hard to overestimate the destruction the Obama administration's policies--their Executive amnesty, their refusal to sufficiently fund and man the border--are causing to law enforcement. A big part of this now is the openness to heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, and other drugs that are being imported. I take that statement by the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection as a direct threat to those officers who want to follow their oath and do their duty. In August 2013, a dramatic event occurred that was too little appreciated. Attorney General Holder, the Attorney General of the United States, ordered Federal prosecutors not to charge certain drug offenders with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences that are in law. If you have so much drugs, you have a minimum penalty. You can get more than that, but you at least have to serve this minimum penalty. He ordered them not to charge those crimes. This is directing prosecutors not to follow the law. It has contributed to a decrease in the number of traffickers being prosecuted and convicted. According to data from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, at the end of 2015--in December--the 6-month average of drug prosecutions was down 21 percent compared to 5 years ago. And what are we seeing? A surge in crime, particularly drugs. Excluding prosecutions in magistrate courts, the 6-month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. We haven't cut the number of drug prosecutors. We haven't cut the [[Page S1307]] number of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we have been doing for 25 years, and it is having an impact. I am afraid it is going to continue. Meanwhile, State and local law enforcement agencies are not given the tools they need to continue taking these dangerous drug traffickers off of the streets. On December 21, 2015, the Department of Justice chose to stop all equitable sharing payments to State, local, and tribal partners under the Asset Forfeiture Program. These are seized proceeds, moneys that are seized from drug dealers, big fancy cars and boats that they seize. For the last 20 years, Federal and State officers worked together. The Federal Government has a good system for forfeiting the money. Then, when the forfeiture is over, it is divided among the agencies. As a result, State and local people are willing to commit law officers to participate in these local task forces because they are helping clean up drugs in their community, helping identify and prosecute nationally significant drug dealers, and they get some compensation back from it when they find a truck full of money. I personally have seen cases where $1 million, $500,000, $800,000 in cash was seized from these people. Some people think, oh, this is wrong; you shouldn't take their cash. This is the ill-gotten gain of an illegal enterprise and they should be able to keep it? They have no proof of any lawful source of this money. Virtually every time, in addition, there is evidence to prove it is connected to drugs. Half the time, they don't even show up to contest the seizure because they know they have no defense to it. This stops this sharing, and it is undermining the unity of effort that we really need to be successful. A joint letter signed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National District Attorneys Association, and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, pointed out that ``the suspension of equitable sharing payments may cause some agencies across the country to reconsider their ability to participate in joint task forces with the Federal Government.'' In other words, they are going to stop participating. ``The effects of this decision are far reaching and not only a disservice to law enforcement, but also to the public they are sworn to protect.'' Mr. President, if there is a limit on my time or others are waiting to speak, I will wrap up. Otherwise, I have about 5 minutes to wrap up. I see my colleague Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I don't want to block him. If my time is up, I will yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). There is no time limit in place. Mr. SESSIONS. While law enforcement resources are being cut off, law enforcement officers are being blocked from doing their jobs, and drug prosecutions are being reduced, the administration and some in Congress want to push and advance a criminal justice ``reform'' bill. But these proposals will have a tendency, I am afraid, to worsen the current problem by allowing for more reductions in sentences than are already occurring and early release of thousands of dangerous drug traffickers, and the weakening of penalties for those prosecuted under our drug trafficking laws, which have already been weakened--sending the wrong message at exactly the wrong time. I am very concerned about this. I love my colleagues, and I know their hearts are in the right place, but I am convinced we should not be heading in this direction at this time. Make no mistake, Federal prisons are not filled with low-level, nonviolent drug possessors. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 99.7 percent of drug offenders in Federal prison at the end of fiscal year 2012 were convicted of drug trafficking offenses, not drug possession. Drug trafficking is inherently violent activity, and it only serves to fund the drug cartels while fueling violence in our cities. According to the FBI, violent crime overall increased across the United States during the first half of 2015, by 6.2 percent for murders and 17 percent in the larger cities for murder--the largest single-year increase since at least 1960. Already this year, homicides in Chicago are double what they were all of last year. This is a complex subject. It is too soon to know the total reason for this increase, but it cannot go unnoticed that over the last decade the Sentencing Commission, which sets standards for sentencing in the United States--outside of the minimum mandatories that are set by our law passed by Congress--has unilaterally imposed reductions in the sentences for drug inmates currently in prison. So we reduced the sentences for those in prison and they are getting out earlier. The most recent reduction in sentences resulted in the release of more than 46,000 drug traffickers--not drug possessors, drug traffickers--which has been wholeheartedly supported by the Obama administration. According to Bureau of Justice Statistics, 77 percent of drug offenders released were rearrested within 5 years. Hear this now: 77 percent of these drug offenders were rearrested within 5 years, with 25 percent of those rearrested being rearrested for a violent crime-- somebody hurt, maybe dead. Maybe that is part of the murder rate increase. Take Wendell Callahan, a Federal drug felon who was convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine and released early pursuant to the Sentencing Commission's directives. Upon his early release, he proceeded to brutally murder his ex-girlfriend and her two little girls, 7 and 10. He would have been deep into a 12\1/2\-year Federal sentence if it had been maintained, but the Sentencing Commission reduced it. The judge granted his petition for early release because of his ``good behavior'' in prison, and that led the judge to conclude he did not pose a danger to the safety of the public, even though in his background--when he was convicted and got the 12 years, he had previously been convicted in connection with a shooting offense and another drug offense. This is why you have to have some controls on judges. I have been there, and I saw it before the sentencing guidelines were passed. The Federal prison population is at its lowest level since 2008. We are already on a downward course of the drug Federal prison population being reduced. There are only 160,000 inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody today, well below its peak. The Bureau of Prisons has stated that this ``downward population trend is expected to continue into Fiscal Year 2017,'' bringing the Federal prisons population to the lowest level since 2005. The population is up. Crime is going up. The prison population is falling rather rapidly. Admissions to Federal prison have declined every year since 2011. You hear: We are filling our prisons. We are doing more and more. Actually, there are other things that are already happening. It is happening in State prisons, too, where larger numbers are incarcerated than in the Federal prisons. One of the reasons we are having this large decline in State prisons is not public safety but tight budgets. They are cutting back on the prison population to save money. We can be smarter. Some people can be released early. I worked with my Democratic colleague, Senator Durbin, 6 years ago, I believe, and we reduced the crack penalties more significantly than a lot of people know. I thought that was justified. But we are now proceeding well beyond that, and it is causing me great concern. The Attorney General has ordered the prosecutors to not charge certain criminal offenses. Reducing sentences and releasing felons is equivalent to reducing the cost to the criminal enterprise of their criminal activity. It reduces the cost, the risk. Thus, crime--it is already rising--would further increase as a result of the criminal justice ``reform'' bill that would further reduce penalties. Can we take a breath, and let's think about this? I don't say there aren't some things we can do that will allow for some reduction in the Federal prison population. Some people probably serve more time than is absolutely necessary. But in truth, we have seen dramatic improvements over nearly 30 years, 25 years, in the reduction of crime. Until this surge, murder rates were less than half what they were in 1980 when I became a Federal prosecutor. Drug use dropped dramatically [[Page S1308]] when Nancy Reagan started the ``Just Say No'' program, and drug use began to steadily decrease. It is now beginning to steadily increase. You have to have leadership from Washington. You can't have the President of the United States of America talking about marijuana like it is no different than taking a drink, saying I used marijuana when I was in high school and it is no different than smoking. It is different. And you are sending a message to young people that there is no danger in this process. It is false that marijuana use doesn't lead people to more drug use. It is already causing a disturbance in the States that have made it legal. I think we need to be careful about this. What if this is the beginning of another surge in drug use like we saw in the sixties and seventies that led to massive problems in our communities? The solution? Well, we have to control the border. All the heroin and a big chunk of the methamphetamine is coming across the Mexican border. We need barriers. We need more agents. People need to be arrested. They need to be deported. They don't get to be taken to some city in the United States they would like to go to and get released and asked to show up on bail, which they never do. That is an open invitation to illegality and illegal entry. We need to enforce our laws, and we have to make the consequences of drug trafficking a deterrent. We can do this. We have done it before, and it is all part and parcel with prevention programs, education programs, and treatment programs. All that has to be done, but it cannot be denied, in my opinion, that law enforcement plays a critical role in it. This means supporting, not blocking the efforts of law enforcement to do their jobs and giving them the tools to arrest drug traffickers and be effective at the border, putting them in jail, not giving them early release so they can commit more crimes. In January, a woman from Ohio named Tonda DaRe testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic. She shared the powerful story of her daughter, who died from a heroin overdose. She said this: One of the things that I see happening in our little town that frustrates me is . . . our officers have worked so diligently to arrest people that they know are bringing this [heroin] in. Just [to] have them go in front of our judges and our judges just slapped these people on the wrist and sent them right back out the door. . . . The boy that sold my daughter the heroin that killed her just recently went back in front of a judge for his fourth offense for trafficking heroin. [It was the] fourth time he's been arrested for this and he was given five months. How [is] that possible? We can talk about making sure we have treatment and recovery for people who have been addicted, although many people never ever recover from addiction--except by the grave. That is the sad truth. We should make that a priority. But we cannot hope to solve these problems by only treating people on the back end of addiction without reducing the availability of those drugs and keeping the purity down and the cost up, not continuing to fall. We have to stop people from becoming addicts in the first place, and we can't let the fact that we have a heroin abuse epidemic cause us to forget that we have a drug trafficking epidemic too. Law enforcement is prevention. Experts tell us that the price, purity, and availability of drugs, especially heroin, fuels more consumption, more addiction, more crime, more death, and more human and family destruction. I wish it were not true. I wish there were more options, but law enforcement is a central part of this effort, and history proves it. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. 51st Anniversary of Bloody Sunday Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is the 51st anniversary of Bloody Sunday--a horrible abuse of American citizens that occurred in Selma, AL. Each year we commemorate the events of that fateful day, because it helped transform our Nation and proved to be a catalyst for the passage of the Voting Rights Act. For the last two years, this commemoration has been a sad reminder of what five justices did to that cornerstone civil rights law. In Shelby County v. Holder a narrow majority of the Court drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act when it struck down the coverage formula for its preclearance provision in Section 5. I mentioned that because under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the Federal Government has the authority to examine and prevent racially discriminatory voting changes from going into effect before those changes disenfranchise voters in covered jurisdictions. By striking down the coverage formula that determined which States and jurisdictions were subject to Federal review, the Court rendered Section 5 unenforceable. Unfortunately, even though almost every single Republican and Democrat in the House and Senate voted for the Voting Rights Act, the Supreme Court, by a 1-vote margin--notwithstanding that 535 of us had voted--drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act by striking down the coverage formula for its preclearance provisions in Section 5. Since then Republican Governors and State legislatures have exploited Shelby County by enacting sweeping voter suppression laws that disproportionately prevent or discourage black Americans from voting. This includes the State of Alabama, which not only enacted a burdensome photo identification law after the decision, but then they made it even harder for many of its black citizens to obtain identification when the State closed more than 30 DMV offices in mostly poor, minority neighborhoods last October. It is hard to fathom that in 2016, well over 100 years after the Civil War and passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, and after transformative moments, such as Bloody Sunday, that States would continue to pass laws and take actions that would undermine black Americans' rights to vote. This past weekend, Congresswoman Terri Sewell, who represents the 7th District of Alabama--which includes Shelby County, Birmingham, and Selma--held a public forum in Birmingham to examine the harm caused by the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision. Several witnesses at that forum testified that the State had made it harder for their citizens to vote, and that a disproportionate number of those citizens were minorities. They also spoke about the urgent need to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act. Congressman John Lewis, our great civil rights hero, was in attendance, and it is heartbreaking to realize that so many of the gains that he was able to help secure through his civil rights activism are being undone today. Despite the compelling testimony about the urgent need for Congress to address voting rights, most Republicans in Congress continue to disregard the urgency of this issue. More than two and a half years since the Shelby County decision, and despite the introduction of two separate bipartisan bills that would restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act, the Republican chairs of the Judiciary Committee from both houses of Congress refuse to even hold a hearing on this issue. Instead, Republican leaders have only paid lip service to the issue, supporting the award of congressional medals for brave civil rights leaders. That is not enough. Recently, the Speaker of the House stated that he was supportive of one of the bipartisan voting rights restoration bills. In the same statement he explained that nothing could be done because the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee refuses to take up the bill or to have a hearing. This is not leadership. The American people expect more than talk. This pattern of Republican obstruction reached unprecedented heights recently when a few Senate Republicans declared that they would not even hold a hearing for the next Supreme Court nominee even before the President has even announced a nominee. Republicans have apparently decided that rather than be transparent and hold public hearings and votes on the most significant issues of the day--including voting rights, comprehensive immigration reform, and the next Supreme Court nominee--they would simply shut down the process. Instead they are making important and timely decisions affecting hundreds of millions of Americans behind closed doors. It is [[Page S1309]] not good for our democracy and it is not good for the American people. We need hearings and a vote on the voting rights bills. And we need a hearing and a vote on the next Supreme Court nominee. We remember what came to be known as Bloody Sunday because the blood that was shed led to greater democratic participation and a more inclusive union. What Republicans are doing now undermines the hard-fought legacy of Bloody Sunday and the Civil Rights Movement. For the good of the Nation, I urge that Republican leaders in the Senate and the House change that shameful course. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to bring us one step closer to passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act or CARA. Last week I suggested that we stay in session and do our job on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday so we could finish the bill, but I understand the Republican leadership wanted to take a long weekend, so we did not finish it, but now we can. I am a cosponsor of this bill because it addresses the growing problem of prescription opioid and heroin addiction that has had devastating impacts on communities all over the country, including my home State of Vermont. This bill represents an important shift in the way we approach the issue of substance abuse and addiction. It sets a comprehensive framework to reduce opioid deaths, prevent addiction, and improve treatment. It will also help those who suffer from opioid use disorders achieve recovery, and perhaps most importantly this bill reflects the consensus of this body that the Nation cannot arrest or jail its way out of this addiction problem. Since my first field hearing in Rutland, VT, on this topic in 2008, I have been inspired by how my fellow Vermonters across the political spectrum have shaped the discussion about this public health crisis and how they have served as a model for communities across the Nation. I certainly feel this bill represents important progress, but we cannot be satisfied with just passing this one bill. We also need a significant commitment of targeted funding so we can carry out and implement the programs authorized by this bill. It is one thing to say we are going to authorize these great programs even though we are not going to pay for them, but don't you feel good that we authorized them. Now we can all go home and tell our constituents we care. We authorized it, but we will not pay for it. At least Senator Shaheen stood and proposed an amendment that would have provided emergency funding to do just that. Her vital amendment had the support of a majority in this body, but Republican Senators blocked it from being considered and adopted. It is unfortunate because Senator Shaheen's amendment would have provided the resources to strengthen both the law enforcement and public health components that would have delivered the necessary resources to health care professionals all over the country who are overwhelmed by a need they cannot meet. I believe there is bipartisan agreement that we have to stop the loss of life caused by opioid abuse. There should be a bipartisan agreement to provide the money necessary to do so. There is an opportunity to make the bill better. Many Members have filed amendments to improve CARA. A number of amendments were filed by both Republicans and Democrats. Unfortunately, the Republican leader has not allowed us to have an open amendment process, and contrary to what he said earlier, a number of Senators have been blocked from offering their amendments. I tried to work--and did in a bipartisan way with Senators Grassley, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar--to consider this bill and report it to the Senate floor. We have continued our bipartisan effort to reach agreement on a number of amendments that could improve the bill. I hope those important bipartisan efforts will continue this week so we can consider these amendments and have final passage this week. Let us have an open process. These amendments can be voted on up or down or adopted by consent. It is one thing for us to talk about what we want to do, it is another thing to have the courage to vote for it. If we do not vote for it, we are just voting maybe. Let us vote yes or no. As we work toward Senate passage of CARA, our goal should be to make this the best bill possible. Addiction is nothing less than an epidemic and CARA treats it like one. This bill demonstrates that Congress now sees addiction for what it is--a public health crisis all over our country. We need to equip our communities with both the programs and resources they need to get ahead of addiction. CARA will save lives. It is worth putting the money in there to make sure it works. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia on the floor, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the senior Senator from Vermont, who is a dear friend of mine. As he knows, this is a problem. It is an epidemic all over this country. No State is immune from it. It doesn't matter whether you are a Democrat or Republican. It has no home. It attacks and literally eradicates all of us, and it causes extreme hardships for all the families. I know the Presiding Officer, who is from Indiana, is aware of this problem. Every week I have come to the floor to read letters from people who have been affected by addiction in West Virginia and other States. I have a letter from the Presiding Officer's home State of Indiana, and I have a letter from my State too. This is something we have been fighting. The CARA Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It is not going to be a cure-all, but it starts in the right direction for us to start looking at opioid addiction and prescription drug abuse, not as much as we have in the past as a crime but as an illness, and an illness needs to have treatment. I think we are moving in that direction. Politically we are accepting this, and we are going to basically meet that need of treatment which is so few and far between. We have 51 people dying every day. In my little, beautiful State of West Virginia, just last year we lost over 600 lives to prescription drug abuse, and I have a State with less than 2 million people. From 1999 to 2013 there has been an increase of over 700 percent. This is a product which has come on the market that is greater than anything we have ever seen. We hope the FDA gets serious about this. They are hearing us loud and clear. Dr. Califf was not someone whom I supported. I am very hopeful he will do a great job, and I will support him. He needs to step up to the plate and change the culture of the FDA. The reason I say that is because the FDA has to take their role seriously and not just approve drugs because it meets a certain criteria but also needs to realize the impact it has on the well-being of the families who have been addicted and affected. They need to consider the devastating public health impacts of its repeated decisions to approve all of these drugs that don't need to be on the market. We are very hopeful for that. The thing that brings that to mind is that it took us forever to get Vicodin and Lortab from a schedule III to a schedule II. It took us over 3 years. Once we did, it took about 1 billion pills off the market, which resulted in a 22-percent decrease in Vicodin and Lortab, which were being passed out like M&Ms. We know it can save lives. Yet they came right back with Zohydro, which was against the wishes of their advisory committee. We believe it is imperative that they have an advisory committee for every opioid they want to bring to the market. They must listen to the advisory committee. If the FDA--the Commissioner and his staff--wishes to go ahead and put a product on the market that is recommended not to be on the market from their advisory committee, they should come before us in Congress and tell us why they believe this potent drug such as Zohydro is needed when it is against the recommendations of these experts and specialists. We have been flooded with these stories. I will read a story from the Presiding Officer's State of Indiana first. [[Page S1310]] The girl's name is Danielle. She says: I live in Southern Indiana and work as a server. About 2\1/2\ years ago a customer by the name of Josh Harvey left me his number. At the time, he told me he was living in Chicago for school. Little did I know he was in rehab there. Granted, I didn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in constant contact. About a year or so ago I found out about his heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know it started out with prescription pills and later went into heroin when the pills became harder to get. He served a month in jail in Michigan, for the entire month of this past July, over a heroin-related charge. He came home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. Luckily, his dad saved him that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient program doing better--or so we all thought. School let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came to me on November 4 telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. I suggested an inpatient program. He went to Wellstone after he left my house, sat for several hours and finally was given a room. I went and checked on him two different times while he waited to make sure he was there. Thursday I didn't receive any calls. Friday nothing either. Then, Saturday morning, the 7th of November, his mother called me to break my heart. He had passed away that Friday the 6th over in Louisville and they didn't know who to contact until that Saturday morning, I guess. He had checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into his house, and took his Xbox, which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. Never in a million years did I think I would become close to anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn't discriminate. It can get a hold of anyone and everybody. Never in my life have I been so depressed or heartbroken. All I want is his story shared. He was my happy ending gone way too soon. That was from our friend in Indiana who wanted to share her story with us. Let me tell you about Amanda, who lives in West Virginia. Amanda said: I walked into our new apartment. Although we had only spent 2 nights there, it already felt like home. I was so excited to move in with Nate. We had been on the fence between being best friends and a couple, and making the decision to move in together had finally settled years of uncertainty. As I turned the corner, I was surprised to see that he was in the exact same position as when I had left for my morning classes. I knew it had been a rough night of ``partying,'' but I thought he would be up to start our busy day of painting and moving. I touched his chest to feel the rise and fall, something that, as a mother, I had been doing to sleeping children for years. There was movement. He was breathing. I breathed a quick sigh of relief. I walked to the back of the apartment to set down my things, and that is when I realized I needed to go and get some things from my old apartment, and I started to leave. My hand was on the doorknob, but something stopped me in my tracks. To this day, I don't know why I turned around. I laid down beside Nate, and I put my arm on his chest. He was not breathing, and when I looked up at his face, his eyes were wide open, but it was obvious that he was not there. The paramedics revived him to the point that he survived in a coma for 1 week. At one point while in the hospital, his eyes opened, and I thought that our nightmare was over, but it was just a muscle reflex and false hope. On January 30, 2007, prescription drugs took the life of Nathan Keith Dunn, age 24. Tall, dark, and handsome is what the world saw. Intelligent, funny, witty, loving, and kind were the qualities seen by those who knew Nate best. He was my best friend, my musical soulmate, and my sounding board. We were inseparable, and I began to experience an ache in my heart that, 9 years later, still occasionally brings me to my knees. But that is just who Nate was to me. He was also the older son of a mother who had left years of abuse at the hands of her husband in order to find a better life for her sons. He was the brother to--and the only soft spot of--a boy who had been hardened growing up on the streets of a town outside of Houston, TX. It seemed as if the only thing that ever kept him grounded was Nate's love. They had one another's back in the best and worst of times. Nate was also the instant crush of any girl who ever laid her eyes upon him. He was the best friend of anyone who knew him. I often wonder who and where he would be today. But I guess I will just have to wonder forever. I wish this was the end of my story about how prescription drugs have affected my life, but it is not even close to the end. For longer than I care to admit, drugs have been part of my everyday life. Shortly after Nate's death, I became addicted to prescription opiates. At first, they were prescribed by my doctor. Eventually, I couldn't get through a day without them. I was what is sometimes referred to as a ``functioning addict,'' although it is fair to say that such a thing does not exist. To the outside world, I appeared to be fine, normal even. I held a job. I cared for my young sons. I kept a tidy home. Meanwhile, my tolerance was building, and I began to require more and more of the drugs just to feel normal, just to get through each day. Can you imagine living this life in which you wake up each day wondering if you have enough of the drug you need just to be OK for that day? So many people are facing this every single day. It could be the person sitting next to you. It could be your child's teacher. Even worse, it could be your own child. The first thing to suffer was my financial situation. Every dime I had was spent on the drugs that would allow me to function today, tomorrow, and if I am lucky, the next. Then, my relationships with friends and family began to fail. It was painfully obvious that I was stealing from them. Next, I couldn't keep a job--a record that will haunt me for the rest of my life. How could I go to work? How could I continue on? Then, a catalyst walked into my life. I met a very good man. As we became closer, I realized that I couldn't bring myself to tell him that I was a drug addict. This is a silent killer. Nobody speaks; they all keep it very quiet. Mr. President, if I may have about 1 minute to finish up, I would appreciate it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Mr. President. Very few people know what is actually happening in your life. In order to get help, you have to be willing to openly talk about your issues, and most of us fear being harshly judged--and rightfully so. Trying to treat a person with addiction issues by using medication only or therapy only is like trying to extinguish a raging house fire with a garden hose. She said: I was fortunate enough to have found a medication-based treatment program in my area, which is paid for by my insurance. She is going to move forward, and she wanted this story to be told. She said she wanted people to know how difficult it is. What we need to know as policymakers is how hard it is for people in our States who realize they need help and can't find it. So what I ask all of us to do--this CARA bill is a step in the right direction. It is a piece of legislation that is much needed. As we move forward today on this piece of legislation, I hope we will find basically the support that people are needing to fight this opiate addiction. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment No. 3378, the substitute amendment to S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, Deb Fischer, John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito, Roy Blunt, Johnny Isakson, John Boozman, Mike Crapo, David Vitter, Mike Rounds, Bill Cassidy, James [[Page S1311]] E. Risch, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Thom Tillis, Orrin G. Hatch. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on amendment No. 3378, as amended, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, to S. 524, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 86, nays 3, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 32 Leg.] YEAS--86 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Booker Boozman Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Manchin McCain McConnell Menendez Merkley Moran Murphy Murray Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--3 Lee Markey Sasse NOT VOTING--11 Boxer Carper Cruz McCaskill Mikulski Murkowski Nelson Rubio Sanders Toomey Vitter The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 86, the nays are 3. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, that is good news. The Presiding Officer just announced the results of the vote, and that is good news because it means the Senate has just taken another step toward the passage of CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I see my colleague Senator Whitehouse is on the floor. I thank him and thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving forward on this legislation that will help us to save friends, family members, our neighbors, and communities that are struggling with addiction. This is a very important opportunity for us to be able to move forward on legislation that is comprehensive, that is bipartisan, and that has a companion bill on the House side, so there is a very good chance we could get this to the President's desk. It is the only bipartisan legislation that is comprehensive and evidence based, and it is critical we move forward with it. In addition to Senator Whitehouse, I also thank Senator Ayotte, Senator Klobuchar, and 42 bipartisan cosponsors for their support. Frankly, more important to me is the support around the country this legislation has. I think Senator Whitehouse and I now have over 130 groups around the country that are supporting this legislation. This includes doctors, nurses, health care professionals, also law enforcement, people who are in the trenches dealing every day with treatment and recovery, and those who are focused on prevention and how to ensure people cannot just be treated for addiction but try to keep people out of the funnel of addiction. We started working on this legislation about 3 years ago. We started by hearing from experts around the country. We had five conferences in Washington where we looked at all the issues, including criminal justice, women and addiction, the science of addiction, youth prevention, recovery issues, substance abuse impacting our veterans--a number of issues that enabled us to write legislation that actually makes sense, that will make a difference in our communities. These 130 groups around the country are focused on getting this bill passed because they know it is going to make a difference in our communities. If enacted, this will help States and communities develop and implement these evidence-based practices that we have looked at from around the country. It expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent prescription opioid abuse and the use of heroin and increases drug disposal sites to keep medications out of the hands of youth. It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamine and expands the availability of the overdose reversal drugs such as naloxone, which are miracle drugs. It provides not just naloxone but also more training to our law enforcement officials, to firefighters, and to other emergency responders. In the criminal justice system, CARA will help promptly identify and treat individuals suffering from substance abuse and expand diversion and education efforts to give individuals a second chance. Frankly, it is going to help to get people into treatment rather than going into the criminal justice system. Locking up people hasn't worked. If people are being arrested for possession alone, for using, this legislation will help to divert those people into the treatment to get them back on their feet. CARA also authorizes resources to expand treatment in general, including medication-assisted treatment--again based on the research that has been done around the country. It allows veterans who were discharged for a substance abuse disorder to use drug courts as they recover. So it provides actual grants to these veterans treatment courts. They are doing a terrific job. I have toured these in Ohio and talked to some of these veterans who have been through these programs. Again, it helps get our veterans back on the right track. Rather than ending in jail, they end up in a treatment program with other veterans helping them and supporting them, where they can begin to deal with their addiction and mental health issues. CARA supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. This happens now at our colleges and universities increasingly. We want to support that. It also creates a task force on recovery to improve ways to address the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. One of the most important aspects of this legislation expands drug treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, babies who are born with addiction. Recently, my wife Jane and I visited Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, OH. We toured the neonatal unit. If you haven't done this, it will break your heart because you will find there an increasing number of babies who are born, again, with this addiction, the neonatal abstinence syndrome. Unfortunately, when you look at what has happened in Ohio, we have had a 750-percent increase in the number of babies who are diagnosed with this neonatal abstinence syndrome just since 2004--a 750-percent increase. I am told in some of our States now 10 percent of the babies are being born addicted. I have also been at other hospitals around our State, including Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and St. Rita's Special Care Nursery in Lima, OH. Last week my wife went to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus. Every single one of these children's hospitals is experiencing the same thing. What I have learned from these incredibly compassionate nurses and doctors who take these newborns [[Page S1312]] through a withdrawal process is that the numbers of babies who have been exposed to heroin or prescription drugs continue to grow. The problem is getting worse, not better. These hospitals serve as yet another reminder that addiction is a disease. It is a disease that has to be treated like other diseases, and it is a disease that can impact anyone. It is wonderful that these caring nurses, doctors, and others are working to try to ensure that these babies become healthy. We don't know what the long-term consequences are, but we need to do more to avoid the addiction in the first place and better treat it when it occurs, and that is what this legislation does. Specifically, the measure takes steps to help women and babies by expanding treatment for expectant and postpartum women and authorizing the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to ensure that these women have access to evidence-based treatment services. That is in this legislation. It also reauthorizes residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction. There is a great center in Columbus, OH, called Amethyst. I had the opportunity to visit it. It is a treatment center, and the average length of stay there is almost 2 years. Their results are unbelievable. They allow women to come with their babies, with their children, to go through treatment together. So there is hope. There are treatment centers doing a great job. We want to hold those up and encourage more of that around the country. Finally, the legislation also creates a pilot program for State substance abuse agencies that allows funds to be used to target women who are addicted to opioids and provide family-based services to those women in nonresidential settings. So it helps on the residential side but also with the nonresidential outpatient side. Helping these women and helping these babies is just one aspect of this bill, but it is a very critical one. As we work to turn the tide in the struggle against addiction, it is one on which we should all be focused. The good news is that the bipartisan momentum we have seen here tonight is building. I think the Senate is ready to move on this legislation this week. There are other amendments that have been filed. The deadline was today. I hope we will have the opportunity to go through some more amendments, as we did last week, but meanwhile, we have strong support and strong momentum, as we saw tonight, on both sides of the aisle. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have lined up to support this legislation. We need to pass this bill and get it signed into law so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives of people we represent. As the heroin epidemic in Ohio and around the country has reached crisis level, I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill over the finish line here in the Senate and then get it passed in the House, where there is companion legislation, and then on to the President's desk and enable this Congress to play a role as a better partner with State and local governments and with our nonprofits around this country to address this growing heroin epidemic around our entire country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Miners Protection Act Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last week I met with Rita Lewis of Westchester, OH, in southwest Ohio. She was here to testify in front of the Senate Committee on Finance in honor of her late husband Butch. Butch worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. I would also add that Butch had been drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates to play baseball some 45 years ago. Instead, he enlisted to go into the U.S. Army and on to Vietnam. He was injured and could never play baseball again competitively. He came back and became a trucker and joined the Teamsters. As I said, he worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. But for Butch and Rita and thousands more Ohio retirees, that promise is under threat. Truckers and mine workers in Ohio and across the country are facing crippling cuts to the benefits they have earned. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act that Congress passed 2 years ago allows pension trustees to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of retirees when a plan is running low on funds. This is disgraceful. If a pension fund is in bad shape, it is our job to fix it, not break promises to American workers who have worked their whole lives to earn that pension. I believed that 2 years ago when I voted against that law which allowed these proposed cuts, and I believe it more strongly now. That is why I am calling on the Treasury Department to reject and to reject immediately the proposed cuts to the Central States Teamsters' pension. I am calling for us to immediately mark up and pass the Miners Protection Act, which will protect the benefits Ohio workers earned over a lifetime of work. Under MEPRA, the bill I talked about a moment ago, multiemployer pension trustees such as Central States are now able to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of participants and retirees if the plans are in ``critical and declining status.'' Pension trustees for plans in ``critical and declining status'' may submit an application for proposed benefit cuts to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Central States pension plan trustees used the authority of MEPRA to propose cuts of as much as 70 percent, but in their own application, they admit that even with these drastic cuts, their plan--get this-- still only has a 50.4-percent chance of remaining solvent. In other words, they are asking Treasury to approve massive, life-shattering cuts to hundreds of thousands of workers for what amounts to a coin flip. Treasury should immediately reject this application. Put yourself--this is something we don't do well around here--put yourself in the place of a worker who has planned for her retirement with her family. She expected a $2,000-a-month pension on top of $1,200 a month in Social Security, and she all of a sudden finds out her pension is cut 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent. That was the money she planned to live on. She has some savings, but all that was calculated because it was a promise from this pension plan to honor that commitment of decades earlier. As I said, Treasury should immediately reject this application. The mine workers' pension plan and the others are too far gone to use MEPRA. The United Mine Workers of America's 1974 pension plan covers 100,000 mine workers, including thousands of miners in eastern and southern Ohio. It was almost completely funded before the financial collapse of 7 years ago brought on by Wall Street overreach and greed, but the plan was devastated by the recession. It has too few assets, too few employers, and too few union workers paying in. If Congress fails to act, thousands of retired miners could lose their health care this year and the entire plan could fail as early as next year. There is a bipartisan solution that is proposed by Senator Manchin, Senator Casey, me, and others and supported by leaders of both parties. If it were brought to the floor today, it would pass with an overwhelming majority. It is time for the Senate to act. The Committee on Finance should mark up this legislation this week. The Senate should bring it to the floor immediately. Miners worked in dangerous jobs--dangers from a mining accident, an explosion, or a collapse every day when they went to work, and dangerous in the sense that so many mine workers die early because of premature bronchial illnesses and heart ailments brought on by working in the mines. They have worked underground their whole lives to put food on the table, to send their kids to school, and to help power this country. Truckers criss-cross the State and country to pay their bills and support their families and drive our economy forward. They all deserve the full pension and health benefits they were promised and they worked a lifetime to earn. Butch Lewis led the Southwest Retirees Pension Committee's fight against cuts to their earned benefits. He passed away on New Year's Eve due to a stroke, which doctors have attributed [[Page S1313]] at least in part to the stress he faced over the proposed pension cuts not just to him and his family but to the workers he was fighting for as a union activist. The benefits to his widow, his wife Rita, have already been cut. She faces an additional 40-percent reduction because of the proposed cuts put forth by Central States. Butch said the cuts being forced on retirees--his words--``amount to a war against the middle class and the American dream.'' He is right. Ohio's retired workers have earned their pensions and their retirement savings over a lifetime of hard work. It was promised to them, whether they worked behind a desk, on the factory floor, down in the coal mines, or behind a wheel. We should honor Butch's memory by continuing his work. That means coming together to support a bipartisan solution to protect Rita's benefits and the pensions of tens of thousands of retired Teamsters and retired mine workers. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1303-S1313] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2015 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 524, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 524) to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Pending: Grassley amendment No. 3378, in the nature of a substitute. Grassley (for Donnelly/Capito) modified amendment No. 3374 (to amendment No. 3378), to provide follow-up services to individuals who have received opioid overdose reversal drugs. Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, before I begin, as we discuss the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Whitehouse for his role in developing the bill and bringing it this far. I also convey my gratitude to Minority Leader Reid and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for their excellent staffs and for urging that my amendments--which I will address momentarily--be a part of the discussion and for managing the negotiations on this bill. I also thank Senator Murray, the ranking member of the HELP Committee, for help and counsel on amendments. Let us pause for a moment and consider the causes of the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic gripping our country. Understanding the causes will help us focus on the right solutions. Three distinct parties bear much of the blame for this public health crisis. First, there is Big Pharma. In the mid-1990s, the seeds of this epidemic [[Page S1304]] were planted with the aggressive, misleading, and ultimately criminal marketing of the powerful opioid painkiller, OxyContin by Purdue Pharma. Perdue claimed OxyContin was not addictive and couldn't be abused. Neither of those claims turned out to be true. Purdue Pharma built a massive marketing and sales program for OxyContin. From 1996 to 2000, Purdue Pharma's sales force more than doubled from more than 300 sales representatives to almost 700 sales representatives. In 2001 alone, Purdue gave out $40 million in bonuses to its burgeoning sales force. As a result of these sales and marketing efforts, from 1997 to 2002, OxyContin prescriptions increased almost tenfold, from 670,000 in 1997 to 6.2 million in 2002. Purdue's marketing of OxyContin broke the law. In 2007, Purdue Pharma paid $600 million in fines and other payments after pleading guilty in Federal court to misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the risks of addiction to OxyContin and its potential for abuse. Second, Purdue Pharma's criminal wrongdoing did not occur in a vacuum. The Federal Government helped to enable this epidemic. The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration is responsible for approving the annual production quotas for pharmaceutical companies to manufacture oxycodone, the principal ingredient in OxyContin. From 1996 to 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration obliged Big Pharma and increased by almost 150 percent the amount of oxycodone authorized for manufacture. In 1996, the DEA authorized U.S. pharmaceutical companies to make the equivalent of 6 billion 10-milligram OxyContin pills. By 2016, that figure had increased to almost 14 billion 10-milligram pills. That is right. Today the Drug Enforcement Administration is telling Big Pharma it is OK to make 14 billion OxyContin pills to sell in the United States in 1 year. The Federal Food and Drug Administration was also complicit, approving new opioid after new opioid. In the process, the FDA, charged with ensuring the safety of all prescription drugs on the U.S. market, began turning a blind eye to outside experts who were warning of the dangers these drugs posed. In 2013, an expert panel established to review the powerful new opioid painkiller Zohydro, voted 11 to 2 against recommending its approval, but the FDA approved the drug anyway, overruling the concerns voiced by experienced physicians on the panel. In 2014, in the wake of the Zohydro decision, the FDA twice skipped the advisory committee process altogether when it approved two new prescription opioids. Then, in August of 2015, the FDA did it again. This time it bypassed an advisory committee of outside experts on the question of a new use for OxyContin for children aged 11 to 16. The FDA even ignored its own rules that specifically call for advisory committee advice when a committee of pediatric dosing is involved. It was clear that the FDA was intentionally choosing to forgo advisory committees in order to avoid another overwhelming Zohydro-like vote, recommending against approval of a prescription opioid and in order to avoid any impediments to new opioids being sold in the United States. Finally, the medical profession must bear its fair share of responsibility for this crisis. Doctors are prescribing opioids at an alarming rate. In 2012, America's doctors wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain relievers, enough pills for every single American adult to have a bottle of opioid pills given to them in the year 2012. And America's doctors are dangerously uninformed about the drugs they are prescribing. A recent survey of 1,000 physicians nationwide found that ``only two-thirds correctly reported that the most common route of abuse was swallowing pills whole.'' It is unconscionable that our doctors are so ill-informed. Nearly half of the doctors surveyed also erroneously reported that so-called abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids were less addictive than their counterparts. Abuse-deterrent opioids are supposed to be harder to crush, so they are harder to snort or to mix with liquid and inject, but abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids are just as addictive as non-abuse-deterrent opioids. Whether an opioid is abuse-deterrent or not hasn't prevented tens of thousands of people who have had their wisdom teeth removed or experienced lower back pain from getting addicted to these painkillers simply by swallowing them. So what is the result of the combination of Big Pharma's marketing of prescription opioids, the Federal Government's repeatedly approving them in ever-increasing numbers, and our doctors writing millions of prescriptions for them? Today, the United States is less than 5 percent of the world's population but we consume 80 percent of the world's opioid painkillers. We have become the United States of Oxy. When prescriptions run out or the price of Oxy pills on the street become too high for those who have become addicted, they turn to cheaper heroin, which shares the same molecular structure as OxyContin. Eighty percent of the people suffering from heroin addiction started with opioid pain medications approved by the FDA and prescribed by doctors. In 2014, nearly 33,000 people died of an opioid overdose in this country. Almost 1,300 of those deaths were in my home State of Massachusetts. I had hoped to offer amendments to CARA to address both the causes of this epidemic and to provide treatment for those suffering from the results. One of my amendments would have required the FDA to convene advisory committees for all prescription opioid approval questions. After I placed a hold on the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf to serve as FDA Commissioner, the agency announced it would only commit to convene advisory committees for non-abuse-deterrent opioids. The FDA refused to agree to convene advisory committees to inform all of its opioid-approval decisions. We need legislation requiring the FDA to seek expert advice about the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids, and I will continue to fight to require advisory committees at the FDA. We also need legislation requiring doctors to get and stay educated about the dangers of the pills they are prescribing in record numbers. Stopping the overprescription of opioid painkillers is a critical step. We need to ensure that all prescribers of these opioid painkillers are educated in the dangers of these drugs, how easily individuals can become addicted, and when and how to appropriately prescribe. The doctors say that they do not want education to be mandated, that it should be voluntary. Well, the FDA has had voluntary education for opioid prescribers in place since 2013 and has been actively encouraging doctors to take these voluntary education programs, but in more than 2 years, only 12 percent of prescribers have actually completed FDA's voluntary education program. It is imperative that any provider who is applying for a Federal DEA license to prescribe opioids have completed mandatory education on the basics of opioid prescribing and the inherent risk of addiction. My amendment would have done just that. It would have required basic education as a condition of a DEA license to prescribe these painkillers, and I will continue to fight to require prescriber education. Finally, we need to remove the barriers to effective treatment, including outdated Federal restrictions on medication-assisted therapies such as Suboxone. Medication-assisted therapy for opioid addiction is cost effective, decreases overdose deaths, and reduces transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. Unlike other treatment regimens for any other disease, physicians are severely limited in the number of patients they can treat with medication-assisted therapies such as Suboxone, contributing to long wait-lists and an inability of patients to get treatment for their addiction when they need it. Of approximately 2.5 million Americans who abused or were dependent on opioids, fewer than 1 million received treatment for their condition, partly because of the already existing Federal instructions. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and I have a bipartisan bill, the Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act, or TREAT Act, which has broad stakeholder support, including the American Medical Association and nurse practitioners. It emphasizes quality of care and closes this gaping [[Page S1305]] hole in our addiction treatment system. We had hoped to offer TREAT as an amendment to CARA. We will continue to fight for it and are hopeful the HELP Committee will include it in the substance abuse legislation the committee will soon consider. My collaboration with Senator Paul shows that whether it is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the Commonwealth of Kentucky, this crisis is the same. It doesn't discriminate by geography, by age, by race, by socioeconomic status, or by employment. It requires a bipartisan effort. Thirty years ago, Nancy Reagan told us to just say no to drugs. Today we have to go further. We have to say enough is enough. We have to recognize what has worked and what hasn't worked. In the past, we believed we could incarcerate our way out of the problem. That did not work. So instead of ignoring and incarcerating, let's avow and act. Let's destigmatize, not criminalize. Let's treat, not retreat. Let's have a comprehensive plan which we put in place that deals with the pharmaceutical companies, the physicians, and the kinds of treatment patients need across our country so that they get the help they need. That is our job. I continue to believe we can do this in a bipartisan fashion as long as we understand the magnitude of the problem and what the causes of it were and continue to be and will be into the future unless and until we put these safeguards in place. So I am looking forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I compliment them for the work they have done so far in bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate this week, but I do believe there is more to be done. As long as this many Americans are addicted, as long as this much OxyContin and opioids are put into our system, then we are going to find that this heroin epidemic we have in our country, which is directly related, will continue to spiral out of control. I want to work with all my colleagues. I thank my colleagues for all the work they have done so far, but there is much work to be done in the future. Madam President, I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to talk for a few minutes about the crime problem we have in America today, the dramatically increasing problem of heroin abuse. Over the last week, we have had a lot of discussion about this crisis, which I am afraid we are just on the cusp of. I think it is going to get worse, based on my experience and my best judgment, but the effort to understand and address it has been going on for a while. In January, we had a good hearing on this issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I want to mention a few things I think we ought to keep in mind as we address this very important problem. Just as background, I served 15 years as a prosecutor, 12 as a U.S. attorney, a Federal prosecutor, and 2\1/2\ as an assistant U.S. attorney. So that was my background when I came here. I was very active and studied the drug and crime problem in America, and I learned some things. There are cycles in this, and people wrote about it over the years. I think we are, unfortunately, moving into another cycle, and we have to be very careful. It is so painful to have a large prison population. We don't want to have that. Year after year, everybody wants to look for alternatives to prison, and we have tried, but if you go too far, you end up not having sufficient consequences for crime, not detaining dangerous offenders, and you end up increasing crime, increasing deaths of Americans from murders and other things, increasing heroin and serious drug problems that destroy families, destroy lives, destroy communities, and result in violence and death. It is a very real problem. A lot of people think, well, if you want to use heroin, so be it. Well, these people can't function. How are they going to survive? They either steal or they get on welfare or they have to go to treatment. And who pays for it, since they do not have any money? We have proven and seen for decades that drug use can be brought down, fewer people can become addicted. In the early 1980s, Nancy Reagan, as President Reagan's wonderful wife, formed the ``Just Say No'' program, and hundreds of thousands of volunteers nationwide in every community in America got together in their communities--they got the treatment community, the law enforcement community, the prevention community, the education community, and the schools--and they worked and worked and crafted policies that would create a climate of hostility for the use of dangerous drugs. The idea was to bring down the use. As a result, the use of illegal drugs dropped by half. It took us 15 or more years, but it dropped by half steadily. What a tremendous victory. In 1980, half of our high school seniors admitted they had used an illegal drug sometime in that year. What an unbelievable number. It had been going up steadily, it peaked, and then it began to go down under this sustained effort. What I have been worried about for some time, and have warned about it, is that if you don't maintain that but start going in the other direction, you can expect drug use to increase. It is that simple. And it is happening. Lives--and young people's lives--will be destroyed by this, families will break up, and children will be scarred. Drug use is no fun, innocent thing. It is destructive. If this Nation is using half as much illegal drugs as before, it is a better nation. It just is. And if we double the amount of drug use in America, it will be a more dangerous Nation and not as good a nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 47,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014. In 2014, 47,000 died. That is one drug overdose death for every 12 minutes. And 61 percent of those overdoses involved opioids. The rate of all opioid overdoses in the United States has tripled since 2000. Overdoses have tripled since 2000. Heroin overdose deaths specifically have increased sixfold since 2001--600 percent--and have more than tripled in just the past 4 years alone. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there were approximately 169,000 new heroin users in 2013. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 2004, approximately 589,000 people in the United States had an opioid use disorder. We used to call that addiction--a problem. It is affecting their lives. The Drug Enforcement Administration's 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment noted that ``drug overdose deaths have become the leading cause of injury death in the United States, ahead of motor vehicle deaths and firearms.'' This is a significant matter. As DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg, a bright, young mind appointed by President Obama, noted last July that ``[a]pproximately 120 people die each day in the United States of a drug overdose.'' Some argue that the increase in heroin abuse is due to over- prescription of opioids from prescription drugs--you get addicted from a prescription drug, and then you move to heroin. I am sure that has some validity, but according to a January 14, 2016, study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the premier authoritative medical journals in the world: In the majority of studies, the increase in the rates of heroin use preceded the change in prescription-opioid policies, and there is no consistent evidence of an association between the implementation of policies related to prescription opioids and increases in the rates of heroin use or deaths, although the data are relatively sparse. Alternatively, heroin market forces-- Please hear this, colleagues-- Alternatively, heroin market forces, including increased accessibility, reduced price, and high purity of heroin appear to be major drivers of the recent increases in rates of heroin use. So it is purity, price, and accessibility. While treatment and accountability are critical to breaking the cycle of addiction, it is not the whole solution. We must also reduce the availability of heroin--we simply have to do that--and other illicit opioids. In December of last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said it is important ``that law enforcement''--a lot of people don't want to talk about this. We have police officers, sheriffs' deputies, Federal agents, drug enforcement [[Page S1306]] agents, and Border Patrol agents. He said it is important ``that law enforcement intensify efforts to reduce the availability of heroin, illegal fentanyl, and other illegal opioids.'' Similarly, Drug Enforcement Administration Acting Administrator Rosenberg said in the DEA's National Drug Threat Assessment that, in addition to providing treatment to addicted opioid abusers, ``law enforcement must continue to have the tools it needs to attack criminal groups who facilitate drug addiction.'' I have been there. I was part of law enforcement's efforts. I invested a tremendous amount of my time in the Coalition for a Drug Free Mobile, the Partnership for Youth, Bay Area Drug Council--groups like that--working on a volunteer basis to change the use of drugs in the community. Law enforcement was always a critical part of it, and law enforcement does have the capability in ways that others don't to reduce the availability, make purity levels less, and otherwise restrict, raising the price of an illegal drug. The DEA's 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment confirms this. They studied the price of the drugs. One thing that tells us whether or not law enforcement and interdiction are effective is to discover if the price is going up or down. Mexican drug cartels are flooding the United States with cheap heroin and methamphetamine. When I was a young prosecutor, it was coming from Turkey, the Middle East, and that was pretty much shut off. President Carter did some good things. I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and came back a few years later as a U.S. Attorney, but during that time they somehow reduced the supply of heroin from the Middle East. As a result, heroin addiction dropped all over the country, and very little heroin was in the heartland of America--mainly just in the big cities. We are also getting cheap methamphetamine from across the Mexican border, which is wide open. The statistics from the DEA Drug Threat Assessment confirm that, from 2010 to 2014, the amount of heroin seized every year at the southwest border has more than doubled. Well, are we catching that much more? No, we are not catching, I am sure, any substantially larger percentage. We are just having a larger amount moving across the border. The price has fallen, so we know we have more. If prices stay low, more people will try it more often, and as the purity level is higher, more people will get addicted sooner and often die quicker. These drug cartels are partnering with criminal gangs and fueling violence in our cities and communities. According to DEA's 2015 Threat Assessment, Mexican drug cartels ``control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their presence in the United States, particularly in heroin markets.'' They import, transport, and are now actually selling it in our cities instead of just bringing it in across the border. In 2013, the heads of the Chicago Crime Commission and the Chicago Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration both named El Chapo Guzman, the infamous leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, as Chicago's ``Public Enemy #1.'' So a man in Mexico, moving heroin and methamphetamine into the United States and hammering Chicago with it-- Chicago named him as their No. 1 public enemy. It cannot be a coincidence, as the FBI's uniform crime statistics show, that the murder rate in Chicago increased by approximately 18 percent during the first 6 months of 2015. At that rate, it is a 36 percent increase in murders in Chicago in 1 year. This is an unbelievably dramatic surge in murders. Another example is Atlanta. DEA's Atlanta office reported an increase of heroin availability from a rating of ``stable'' in the first half of 2013 to ``high'' just a year later. According to the FBI's uniform crime statistics, the murder rate in Atlanta increased by approximately 15 percent in the first 6 months of 2015. This is an unsustainable thing. The old rule is a 7-percent increase and your money doubles in 10 years. When you get 15- and 18-percent increases in 6 months--that's 30 percent in 1 year--you are doubling the crime rate, the murder rate, in 3 years. At a November hearing of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I asked DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley about these drug distribution networks and the people in local communities pushing the drugs, selling the drugs, and collecting the money. This money eventually ends up back in Mexico, Colombia, and South and Central America, funding the evil, violent drug cartels that are destabilizing whole nations. He responded that it is ``almost as big a problem as the cartels themselves.'' When I asked him whether these drug traffickers are the ones causing the violence and death on our streets, he responded that ``they are the ones that regulate themselves by the barrel of a gun.'' If you want to collect a drug debt, you can't file a lawsuit in Federal court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun. By its very nature, drug distribution networks are violent criminals. It has always been so, and it will always be so. Conducting an illegal enterprise, they have to maintain discipline, and they use threats and violence to maintain it and collect their debts. We must not forget what became obvious in the early 1980s, when I was a U.S. Attorney: Drug dealers and their organizations are not nonviolent criminals. These are violent crimes. Rather than enforcing the law and making it tougher on drug cartels by keeping our border secure, the Obama administration has done exactly the opposite. Our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to flood our country with cheap heroin, and the administration has made it clear that officers are not to deviate from the President's lawless immigration policy. They are blocked from doing their job and following their oath. Just last week--and as someone who has worked closely with Federal Drug Enforcement officers and immigration officers as a Federal prosecutor--Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske testified before the House Committee on Appropriations that ``if you don't want to follow the directions of your superiors, including the president of the United States and the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, then you really do need to look for another job.'' Do you hear what he is saying there, colleagues? What he is saying is that if you want to do your job and enforce the laws as the laws are written, which we have ordered you not to do, and you go on and do it anyway, then look for another job. It is one of the most amazing things I have seen in my entire law enforcement career. ICE officers-- Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers--who enforce drug laws, along with immigration laws, these officers sued their supervisors. They sued their supervisors, alleging that they were being ordered to violate their oath to enforce the immigration laws of the United States by these restrictive policies. It is hard to overestimate the destruction the Obama administration's policies--their Executive amnesty, their refusal to sufficiently fund and man the border--are causing to law enforcement. A big part of this now is the openness to heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, and other drugs that are being imported. I take that statement by the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection as a direct threat to those officers who want to follow their oath and do their duty. In August 2013, a dramatic event occurred that was too little appreciated. Attorney General Holder, the Attorney General of the United States, ordered Federal prosecutors not to charge certain drug offenders with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences that are in law. If you have so much drugs, you have a minimum penalty. You can get more than that, but you at least have to serve this minimum penalty. He ordered them not to charge those crimes. This is directing prosecutors not to follow the law. It has contributed to a decrease in the number of traffickers being prosecuted and convicted. According to data from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, at the end of 2015--in December--the 6-month average of drug prosecutions was down 21 percent compared to 5 years ago. And what are we seeing? A surge in crime, particularly drugs. Excluding prosecutions in magistrate courts, the 6-month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. We haven't cut the number of drug prosecutors. We haven't cut the [[Page S1307]] number of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we have been doing for 25 years, and it is having an impact. I am afraid it is going to continue. Meanwhile, State and local law enforcement agencies are not given the tools they need to continue taking these dangerous drug traffickers off of the streets. On December 21, 2015, the Department of Justice chose to stop all equitable sharing payments to State, local, and tribal partners under the Asset Forfeiture Program. These are seized proceeds, moneys that are seized from drug dealers, big fancy cars and boats that they seize. For the last 20 years, Federal and State officers worked together. The Federal Government has a good system for forfeiting the money. Then, when the forfeiture is over, it is divided among the agencies. As a result, State and local people are willing to commit law officers to participate in these local task forces because they are helping clean up drugs in their community, helping identify and prosecute nationally significant drug dealers, and they get some compensation back from it when they find a truck full of money. I personally have seen cases where $1 million, $500,000, $800,000 in cash was seized from these people. Some people think, oh, this is wrong; you shouldn't take their cash. This is the ill-gotten gain of an illegal enterprise and they should be able to keep it? They have no proof of any lawful source of this money. Virtually every time, in addition, there is evidence to prove it is connected to drugs. Half the time, they don't even show up to contest the seizure because they know they have no defense to it. This stops this sharing, and it is undermining the unity of effort that we really need to be successful. A joint letter signed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National District Attorneys Association, and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, pointed out that ``the suspension of equitable sharing payments may cause some agencies across the country to reconsider their ability to participate in joint task forces with the Federal Government.'' In other words, they are going to stop participating. ``The effects of this decision are far reaching and not only a disservice to law enforcement, but also to the public they are sworn to protect.'' Mr. President, if there is a limit on my time or others are waiting to speak, I will wrap up. Otherwise, I have about 5 minutes to wrap up. I see my colleague Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I don't want to block him. If my time is up, I will yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). There is no time limit in place. Mr. SESSIONS. While law enforcement resources are being cut off, law enforcement officers are being blocked from doing their jobs, and drug prosecutions are being reduced, the administration and some in Congress want to push and advance a criminal justice ``reform'' bill. But these proposals will have a tendency, I am afraid, to worsen the current problem by allowing for more reductions in sentences than are already occurring and early release of thousands of dangerous drug traffickers, and the weakening of penalties for those prosecuted under our drug trafficking laws, which have already been weakened--sending the wrong message at exactly the wrong time. I am very concerned about this. I love my colleagues, and I know their hearts are in the right place, but I am convinced we should not be heading in this direction at this time. Make no mistake, Federal prisons are not filled with low-level, nonviolent drug possessors. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 99.7 percent of drug offenders in Federal prison at the end of fiscal year 2012 were convicted of drug trafficking offenses, not drug possession. Drug trafficking is inherently violent activity, and it only serves to fund the drug cartels while fueling violence in our cities. According to the FBI, violent crime overall increased across the United States during the first half of 2015, by 6.2 percent for murders and 17 percent in the larger cities for murder--the largest single-year increase since at least 1960. Already this year, homicides in Chicago are double what they were all of last year. This is a complex subject. It is too soon to know the total reason for this increase, but it cannot go unnoticed that over the last decade the Sentencing Commission, which sets standards for sentencing in the United States--outside of the minimum mandatories that are set by our law passed by Congress--has unilaterally imposed reductions in the sentences for drug inmates currently in prison. So we reduced the sentences for those in prison and they are getting out earlier. The most recent reduction in sentences resulted in the release of more than 46,000 drug traffickers--not drug possessors, drug traffickers--which has been wholeheartedly supported by the Obama administration. According to Bureau of Justice Statistics, 77 percent of drug offenders released were rearrested within 5 years. Hear this now: 77 percent of these drug offenders were rearrested within 5 years, with 25 percent of those rearrested being rearrested for a violent crime-- somebody hurt, maybe dead. Maybe that is part of the murder rate increase. Take Wendell Callahan, a Federal drug felon who was convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine and released early pursuant to the Sentencing Commission's directives. Upon his early release, he proceeded to brutally murder his ex-girlfriend and her two little girls, 7 and 10. He would have been deep into a 12\1/2\-year Federal sentence if it had been maintained, but the Sentencing Commission reduced it. The judge granted his petition for early release because of his ``good behavior'' in prison, and that led the judge to conclude he did not pose a danger to the safety of the public, even though in his background--when he was convicted and got the 12 years, he had previously been convicted in connection with a shooting offense and another drug offense. This is why you have to have some controls on judges. I have been there, and I saw it before the sentencing guidelines were passed. The Federal prison population is at its lowest level since 2008. We are already on a downward course of the drug Federal prison population being reduced. There are only 160,000 inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody today, well below its peak. The Bureau of Prisons has stated that this ``downward population trend is expected to continue into Fiscal Year 2017,'' bringing the Federal prisons population to the lowest level since 2005. The population is up. Crime is going up. The prison population is falling rather rapidly. Admissions to Federal prison have declined every year since 2011. You hear: We are filling our prisons. We are doing more and more. Actually, there are other things that are already happening. It is happening in State prisons, too, where larger numbers are incarcerated than in the Federal prisons. One of the reasons we are having this large decline in State prisons is not public safety but tight budgets. They are cutting back on the prison population to save money. We can be smarter. Some people can be released early. I worked with my Democratic colleague, Senator Durbin, 6 years ago, I believe, and we reduced the crack penalties more significantly than a lot of people know. I thought that was justified. But we are now proceeding well beyond that, and it is causing me great concern. The Attorney General has ordered the prosecutors to not charge certain criminal offenses. Reducing sentences and releasing felons is equivalent to reducing the cost to the criminal enterprise of their criminal activity. It reduces the cost, the risk. Thus, crime--it is already rising--would further increase as a result of the criminal justice ``reform'' bill that would further reduce penalties. Can we take a breath, and let's think about this? I don't say there aren't some things we can do that will allow for some reduction in the Federal prison population. Some people probably serve more time than is absolutely necessary. But in truth, we have seen dramatic improvements over nearly 30 years, 25 years, in the reduction of crime. Until this surge, murder rates were less than half what they were in 1980 when I became a Federal prosecutor. Drug use dropped dramatically [[Page S1308]] when Nancy Reagan started the ``Just Say No'' program, and drug use began to steadily decrease. It is now beginning to steadily increase. You have to have leadership from Washington. You can't have the President of the United States of America talking about marijuana like it is no different than taking a drink, saying I used marijuana when I was in high school and it is no different than smoking. It is different. And you are sending a message to young people that there is no danger in this process. It is false that marijuana use doesn't lead people to more drug use. It is already causing a disturbance in the States that have made it legal. I think we need to be careful about this. What if this is the beginning of another surge in drug use like we saw in the sixties and seventies that led to massive problems in our communities? The solution? Well, we have to control the border. All the heroin and a big chunk of the methamphetamine is coming across the Mexican border. We need barriers. We need more agents. People need to be arrested. They need to be deported. They don't get to be taken to some city in the United States they would like to go to and get released and asked to show up on bail, which they never do. That is an open invitation to illegality and illegal entry. We need to enforce our laws, and we have to make the consequences of drug trafficking a deterrent. We can do this. We have done it before, and it is all part and parcel with prevention programs, education programs, and treatment programs. All that has to be done, but it cannot be denied, in my opinion, that law enforcement plays a critical role in it. This means supporting, not blocking the efforts of law enforcement to do their jobs and giving them the tools to arrest drug traffickers and be effective at the border, putting them in jail, not giving them early release so they can commit more crimes. In January, a woman from Ohio named Tonda DaRe testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic. She shared the powerful story of her daughter, who died from a heroin overdose. She said this: One of the things that I see happening in our little town that frustrates me is . . . our officers have worked so diligently to arrest people that they know are bringing this [heroin] in. Just [to] have them go in front of our judges and our judges just slapped these people on the wrist and sent them right back out the door. . . . The boy that sold my daughter the heroin that killed her just recently went back in front of a judge for his fourth offense for trafficking heroin. [It was the] fourth time he's been arrested for this and he was given five months. How [is] that possible? We can talk about making sure we have treatment and recovery for people who have been addicted, although many people never ever recover from addiction--except by the grave. That is the sad truth. We should make that a priority. But we cannot hope to solve these problems by only treating people on the back end of addiction without reducing the availability of those drugs and keeping the purity down and the cost up, not continuing to fall. We have to stop people from becoming addicts in the first place, and we can't let the fact that we have a heroin abuse epidemic cause us to forget that we have a drug trafficking epidemic too. Law enforcement is prevention. Experts tell us that the price, purity, and availability of drugs, especially heroin, fuels more consumption, more addiction, more crime, more death, and more human and family destruction. I wish it were not true. I wish there were more options, but law enforcement is a central part of this effort, and history proves it. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. 51st Anniversary of Bloody Sunday Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is the 51st anniversary of Bloody Sunday--a horrible abuse of American citizens that occurred in Selma, AL. Each year we commemorate the events of that fateful day, because it helped transform our Nation and proved to be a catalyst for the passage of the Voting Rights Act. For the last two years, this commemoration has been a sad reminder of what five justices did to that cornerstone civil rights law. In Shelby County v. Holder a narrow majority of the Court drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act when it struck down the coverage formula for its preclearance provision in Section 5. I mentioned that because under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the Federal Government has the authority to examine and prevent racially discriminatory voting changes from going into effect before those changes disenfranchise voters in covered jurisdictions. By striking down the coverage formula that determined which States and jurisdictions were subject to Federal review, the Court rendered Section 5 unenforceable. Unfortunately, even though almost every single Republican and Democrat in the House and Senate voted for the Voting Rights Act, the Supreme Court, by a 1-vote margin--notwithstanding that 535 of us had voted--drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act by striking down the coverage formula for its preclearance provisions in Section 5. Since then Republican Governors and State legislatures have exploited Shelby County by enacting sweeping voter suppression laws that disproportionately prevent or discourage black Americans from voting. This includes the State of Alabama, which not only enacted a burdensome photo identification law after the decision, but then they made it even harder for many of its black citizens to obtain identification when the State closed more than 30 DMV offices in mostly poor, minority neighborhoods last October. It is hard to fathom that in 2016, well over 100 years after the Civil War and passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, and after transformative moments, such as Bloody Sunday, that States would continue to pass laws and take actions that would undermine black Americans' rights to vote. This past weekend, Congresswoman Terri Sewell, who represents the 7th District of Alabama--which includes Shelby County, Birmingham, and Selma--held a public forum in Birmingham to examine the harm caused by the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision. Several witnesses at that forum testified that the State had made it harder for their citizens to vote, and that a disproportionate number of those citizens were minorities. They also spoke about the urgent need to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act. Congressman John Lewis, our great civil rights hero, was in attendance, and it is heartbreaking to realize that so many of the gains that he was able to help secure through his civil rights activism are being undone today. Despite the compelling testimony about the urgent need for Congress to address voting rights, most Republicans in Congress continue to disregard the urgency of this issue. More than two and a half years since the Shelby County decision, and despite the introduction of two separate bipartisan bills that would restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act, the Republican chairs of the Judiciary Committee from both houses of Congress refuse to even hold a hearing on this issue. Instead, Republican leaders have only paid lip service to the issue, supporting the award of congressional medals for brave civil rights leaders. That is not enough. Recently, the Speaker of the House stated that he was supportive of one of the bipartisan voting rights restoration bills. In the same statement he explained that nothing could be done because the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee refuses to take up the bill or to have a hearing. This is not leadership. The American people expect more than talk. This pattern of Republican obstruction reached unprecedented heights recently when a few Senate Republicans declared that they would not even hold a hearing for the next Supreme Court nominee even before the President has even announced a nominee. Republicans have apparently decided that rather than be transparent and hold public hearings and votes on the most significant issues of the day--including voting rights, comprehensive immigration reform, and the next Supreme Court nominee--they would simply shut down the process. Instead they are making important and timely decisions affecting hundreds of millions of Americans behind closed doors. It is [[Page S1309]] not good for our democracy and it is not good for the American people. We need hearings and a vote on the voting rights bills. And we need a hearing and a vote on the next Supreme Court nominee. We remember what came to be known as Bloody Sunday because the blood that was shed led to greater democratic participation and a more inclusive union. What Republicans are doing now undermines the hard-fought legacy of Bloody Sunday and the Civil Rights Movement. For the good of the Nation, I urge that Republican leaders in the Senate and the House change that shameful course. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to bring us one step closer to passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act or CARA. Last week I suggested that we stay in session and do our job on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday so we could finish the bill, but I understand the Republican leadership wanted to take a long weekend, so we did not finish it, but now we can. I am a cosponsor of this bill because it addresses the growing problem of prescription opioid and heroin addiction that has had devastating impacts on communities all over the country, including my home State of Vermont. This bill represents an important shift in the way we approach the issue of substance abuse and addiction. It sets a comprehensive framework to reduce opioid deaths, prevent addiction, and improve treatment. It will also help those who suffer from opioid use disorders achieve recovery, and perhaps most importantly this bill reflects the consensus of this body that the Nation cannot arrest or jail its way out of this addiction problem. Since my first field hearing in Rutland, VT, on this topic in 2008, I have been inspired by how my fellow Vermonters across the political spectrum have shaped the discussion about this public health crisis and how they have served as a model for communities across the Nation. I certainly feel this bill represents important progress, but we cannot be satisfied with just passing this one bill. We also need a significant commitment of targeted funding so we can carry out and implement the programs authorized by this bill. It is one thing to say we are going to authorize these great programs even though we are not going to pay for them, but don't you feel good that we authorized them. Now we can all go home and tell our constituents we care. We authorized it, but we will not pay for it. At least Senator Shaheen stood and proposed an amendment that would have provided emergency funding to do just that. Her vital amendment had the support of a majority in this body, but Republican Senators blocked it from being considered and adopted. It is unfortunate because Senator Shaheen's amendment would have provided the resources to strengthen both the law enforcement and public health components that would have delivered the necessary resources to health care professionals all over the country who are overwhelmed by a need they cannot meet. I believe there is bipartisan agreement that we have to stop the loss of life caused by opioid abuse. There should be a bipartisan agreement to provide the money necessary to do so. There is an opportunity to make the bill better. Many Members have filed amendments to improve CARA. A number of amendments were filed by both Republicans and Democrats. Unfortunately, the Republican leader has not allowed us to have an open amendment process, and contrary to what he said earlier, a number of Senators have been blocked from offering their amendments. I tried to work--and did in a bipartisan way with Senators Grassley, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar--to consider this bill and report it to the Senate floor. We have continued our bipartisan effort to reach agreement on a number of amendments that could improve the bill. I hope those important bipartisan efforts will continue this week so we can consider these amendments and have final passage this week. Let us have an open process. These amendments can be voted on up or down or adopted by consent. It is one thing for us to talk about what we want to do, it is another thing to have the courage to vote for it. If we do not vote for it, we are just voting maybe. Let us vote yes or no. As we work toward Senate passage of CARA, our goal should be to make this the best bill possible. Addiction is nothing less than an epidemic and CARA treats it like one. This bill demonstrates that Congress now sees addiction for what it is--a public health crisis all over our country. We need to equip our communities with both the programs and resources they need to get ahead of addiction. CARA will save lives. It is worth putting the money in there to make sure it works. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia on the floor, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the senior Senator from Vermont, who is a dear friend of mine. As he knows, this is a problem. It is an epidemic all over this country. No State is immune from it. It doesn't matter whether you are a Democrat or Republican. It has no home. It attacks and literally eradicates all of us, and it causes extreme hardships for all the families. I know the Presiding Officer, who is from Indiana, is aware of this problem. Every week I have come to the floor to read letters from people who have been affected by addiction in West Virginia and other States. I have a letter from the Presiding Officer's home State of Indiana, and I have a letter from my State too. This is something we have been fighting. The CARA Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It is not going to be a cure-all, but it starts in the right direction for us to start looking at opioid addiction and prescription drug abuse, not as much as we have in the past as a crime but as an illness, and an illness needs to have treatment. I think we are moving in that direction. Politically we are accepting this, and we are going to basically meet that need of treatment which is so few and far between. We have 51 people dying every day. In my little, beautiful State of West Virginia, just last year we lost over 600 lives to prescription drug abuse, and I have a State with less than 2 million people. From 1999 to 2013 there has been an increase of over 700 percent. This is a product which has come on the market that is greater than anything we have ever seen. We hope the FDA gets serious about this. They are hearing us loud and clear. Dr. Califf was not someone whom I supported. I am very hopeful he will do a great job, and I will support him. He needs to step up to the plate and change the culture of the FDA. The reason I say that is because the FDA has to take their role seriously and not just approve drugs because it meets a certain criteria but also needs to realize the impact it has on the well-being of the families who have been addicted and affected. They need to consider the devastating public health impacts of its repeated decisions to approve all of these drugs that don't need to be on the market. We are very hopeful for that. The thing that brings that to mind is that it took us forever to get Vicodin and Lortab from a schedule III to a schedule II. It took us over 3 years. Once we did, it took about 1 billion pills off the market, which resulted in a 22-percent decrease in Vicodin and Lortab, which were being passed out like M&Ms. We know it can save lives. Yet they came right back with Zohydro, which was against the wishes of their advisory committee. We believe it is imperative that they have an advisory committee for every opioid they want to bring to the market. They must listen to the advisory committee. If the FDA--the Commissioner and his staff--wishes to go ahead and put a product on the market that is recommended not to be on the market from their advisory committee, they should come before us in Congress and tell us why they believe this potent drug such as Zohydro is needed when it is against the recommendations of these experts and specialists. We have been flooded with these stories. I will read a story from the Presiding Officer's State of Indiana first. [[Page S1310]] The girl's name is Danielle. She says: I live in Southern Indiana and work as a server. About 2\1/2\ years ago a customer by the name of Josh Harvey left me his number. At the time, he told me he was living in Chicago for school. Little did I know he was in rehab there. Granted, I didn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in constant contact. About a year or so ago I found out about his heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know it started out with prescription pills and later went into heroin when the pills became harder to get. He served a month in jail in Michigan, for the entire month of this past July, over a heroin-related charge. He came home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. Luckily, his dad saved him that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient program doing better--or so we all thought. School let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came to me on November 4 telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. I suggested an inpatient program. He went to Wellstone after he left my house, sat for several hours and finally was given a room. I went and checked on him two different times while he waited to make sure he was there. Thursday I didn't receive any calls. Friday nothing either. Then, Saturday morning, the 7th of November, his mother called me to break my heart. He had passed away that Friday the 6th over in Louisville and they didn't know who to contact until that Saturday morning, I guess. He had checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into his house, and took his Xbox, which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. Never in a million years did I think I would become close to anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn't discriminate. It can get a hold of anyone and everybody. Never in my life have I been so depressed or heartbroken. All I want is his story shared. He was my happy ending gone way too soon. That was from our friend in Indiana who wanted to share her story with us. Let me tell you about Amanda, who lives in West Virginia. Amanda said: I walked into our new apartment. Although we had only spent 2 nights there, it already felt like home. I was so excited to move in with Nate. We had been on the fence between being best friends and a couple, and making the decision to move in together had finally settled years of uncertainty. As I turned the corner, I was surprised to see that he was in the exact same position as when I had left for my morning classes. I knew it had been a rough night of ``partying,'' but I thought he would be up to start our busy day of painting and moving. I touched his chest to feel the rise and fall, something that, as a mother, I had been doing to sleeping children for years. There was movement. He was breathing. I breathed a quick sigh of relief. I walked to the back of the apartment to set down my things, and that is when I realized I needed to go and get some things from my old apartment, and I started to leave. My hand was on the doorknob, but something stopped me in my tracks. To this day, I don't know why I turned around. I laid down beside Nate, and I put my arm on his chest. He was not breathing, and when I looked up at his face, his eyes were wide open, but it was obvious that he was not there. The paramedics revived him to the point that he survived in a coma for 1 week. At one point while in the hospital, his eyes opened, and I thought that our nightmare was over, but it was just a muscle reflex and false hope. On January 30, 2007, prescription drugs took the life of Nathan Keith Dunn, age 24. Tall, dark, and handsome is what the world saw. Intelligent, funny, witty, loving, and kind were the qualities seen by those who knew Nate best. He was my best friend, my musical soulmate, and my sounding board. We were inseparable, and I began to experience an ache in my heart that, 9 years later, still occasionally brings me to my knees. But that is just who Nate was to me. He was also the older son of a mother who had left years of abuse at the hands of her husband in order to find a better life for her sons. He was the brother to--and the only soft spot of--a boy who had been hardened growing up on the streets of a town outside of Houston, TX. It seemed as if the only thing that ever kept him grounded was Nate's love. They had one another's back in the best and worst of times. Nate was also the instant crush of any girl who ever laid her eyes upon him. He was the best friend of anyone who knew him. I often wonder who and where he would be today. But I guess I will just have to wonder forever. I wish this was the end of my story about how prescription drugs have affected my life, but it is not even close to the end. For longer than I care to admit, drugs have been part of my everyday life. Shortly after Nate's death, I became addicted to prescription opiates. At first, they were prescribed by my doctor. Eventually, I couldn't get through a day without them. I was what is sometimes referred to as a ``functioning addict,'' although it is fair to say that such a thing does not exist. To the outside world, I appeared to be fine, normal even. I held a job. I cared for my young sons. I kept a tidy home. Meanwhile, my tolerance was building, and I began to require more and more of the drugs just to feel normal, just to get through each day. Can you imagine living this life in which you wake up each day wondering if you have enough of the drug you need just to be OK for that day? So many people are facing this every single day. It could be the person sitting next to you. It could be your child's teacher. Even worse, it could be your own child. The first thing to suffer was my financial situation. Every dime I had was spent on the drugs that would allow me to function today, tomorrow, and if I am lucky, the next. Then, my relationships with friends and family began to fail. It was painfully obvious that I was stealing from them. Next, I couldn't keep a job--a record that will haunt me for the rest of my life. How could I go to work? How could I continue on? Then, a catalyst walked into my life. I met a very good man. As we became closer, I realized that I couldn't bring myself to tell him that I was a drug addict. This is a silent killer. Nobody speaks; they all keep it very quiet. Mr. President, if I may have about 1 minute to finish up, I would appreciate it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Mr. President. Very few people know what is actually happening in your life. In order to get help, you have to be willing to openly talk about your issues, and most of us fear being harshly judged--and rightfully so. Trying to treat a person with addiction issues by using medication only or therapy only is like trying to extinguish a raging house fire with a garden hose. She said: I was fortunate enough to have found a medication-based treatment program in my area, which is paid for by my insurance. She is going to move forward, and she wanted this story to be told. She said she wanted people to know how difficult it is. What we need to know as policymakers is how hard it is for people in our States who realize they need help and can't find it. So what I ask all of us to do--this CARA bill is a step in the right direction. It is a piece of legislation that is much needed. As we move forward today on this piece of legislation, I hope we will find basically the support that people are needing to fight this opiate addiction. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment No. 3378, the substitute amendment to S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, Deb Fischer, John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito, Roy Blunt, Johnny Isakson, John Boozman, Mike Crapo, David Vitter, Mike Rounds, Bill Cassidy, James [[Page S1311]] E. Risch, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Thom Tillis, Orrin G. Hatch. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on amendment No. 3378, as amended, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, to S. 524, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 86, nays 3, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 32 Leg.] YEAS--86 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Booker Boozman Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Manchin McCain McConnell Menendez Merkley Moran Murphy Murray Paul Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Risch Roberts Rounds Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--3 Lee Markey Sasse NOT VOTING--11 Boxer Carper Cruz McCaskill Mikulski Murkowski Nelson Rubio Sanders Toomey Vitter The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 86, the nays are 3. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, that is good news. The Presiding Officer just announced the results of the vote, and that is good news because it means the Senate has just taken another step toward the passage of CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I see my colleague Senator Whitehouse is on the floor. I thank him and thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving forward on this legislation that will help us to save friends, family members, our neighbors, and communities that are struggling with addiction. This is a very important opportunity for us to be able to move forward on legislation that is comprehensive, that is bipartisan, and that has a companion bill on the House side, so there is a very good chance we could get this to the President's desk. It is the only bipartisan legislation that is comprehensive and evidence based, and it is critical we move forward with it. In addition to Senator Whitehouse, I also thank Senator Ayotte, Senator Klobuchar, and 42 bipartisan cosponsors for their support. Frankly, more important to me is the support around the country this legislation has. I think Senator Whitehouse and I now have over 130 groups around the country that are supporting this legislation. This includes doctors, nurses, health care professionals, also law enforcement, people who are in the trenches dealing every day with treatment and recovery, and those who are focused on prevention and how to ensure people cannot just be treated for addiction but try to keep people out of the funnel of addiction. We started working on this legislation about 3 years ago. We started by hearing from experts around the country. We had five conferences in Washington where we looked at all the issues, including criminal justice, women and addiction, the science of addiction, youth prevention, recovery issues, substance abuse impacting our veterans--a number of issues that enabled us to write legislation that actually makes sense, that will make a difference in our communities. These 130 groups around the country are focused on getting this bill passed because they know it is going to make a difference in our communities. If enacted, this will help States and communities develop and implement these evidence-based practices that we have looked at from around the country. It expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent prescription opioid abuse and the use of heroin and increases drug disposal sites to keep medications out of the hands of youth. It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamine and expands the availability of the overdose reversal drugs such as naloxone, which are miracle drugs. It provides not just naloxone but also more training to our law enforcement officials, to firefighters, and to other emergency responders. In the criminal justice system, CARA will help promptly identify and treat individuals suffering from substance abuse and expand diversion and education efforts to give individuals a second chance. Frankly, it is going to help to get people into treatment rather than going into the criminal justice system. Locking up people hasn't worked. If people are being arrested for possession alone, for using, this legislation will help to divert those people into the treatment to get them back on their feet. CARA also authorizes resources to expand treatment in general, including medication-assisted treatment--again based on the research that has been done around the country. It allows veterans who were discharged for a substance abuse disorder to use drug courts as they recover. So it provides actual grants to these veterans treatment courts. They are doing a terrific job. I have toured these in Ohio and talked to some of these veterans who have been through these programs. Again, it helps get our veterans back on the right track. Rather than ending in jail, they end up in a treatment program with other veterans helping them and supporting them, where they can begin to deal with their addiction and mental health issues. CARA supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. This happens now at our colleges and universities increasingly. We want to support that. It also creates a task force on recovery to improve ways to address the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. One of the most important aspects of this legislation expands drug treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, babies who are born with addiction. Recently, my wife Jane and I visited Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, OH. We toured the neonatal unit. If you haven't done this, it will break your heart because you will find there an increasing number of babies who are born, again, with this addiction, the neonatal abstinence syndrome. Unfortunately, when you look at what has happened in Ohio, we have had a 750-percent increase in the number of babies who are diagnosed with this neonatal abstinence syndrome just since 2004--a 750-percent increase. I am told in some of our States now 10 percent of the babies are being born addicted. I have also been at other hospitals around our State, including Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and St. Rita's Special Care Nursery in Lima, OH. Last week my wife went to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus. Every single one of these children's hospitals is experiencing the same thing. What I have learned from these incredibly compassionate nurses and doctors who take these newborns [[Page S1312]] through a withdrawal process is that the numbers of babies who have been exposed to heroin or prescription drugs continue to grow. The problem is getting worse, not better. These hospitals serve as yet another reminder that addiction is a disease. It is a disease that has to be treated like other diseases, and it is a disease that can impact anyone. It is wonderful that these caring nurses, doctors, and others are working to try to ensure that these babies become healthy. We don't know what the long-term consequences are, but we need to do more to avoid the addiction in the first place and better treat it when it occurs, and that is what this legislation does. Specifically, the measure takes steps to help women and babies by expanding treatment for expectant and postpartum women and authorizing the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to ensure that these women have access to evidence-based treatment services. That is in this legislation. It also reauthorizes residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction. There is a great center in Columbus, OH, called Amethyst. I had the opportunity to visit it. It is a treatment center, and the average length of stay there is almost 2 years. Their results are unbelievable. They allow women to come with their babies, with their children, to go through treatment together. So there is hope. There are treatment centers doing a great job. We want to hold those up and encourage more of that around the country. Finally, the legislation also creates a pilot program for State substance abuse agencies that allows funds to be used to target women who are addicted to opioids and provide family-based services to those women in nonresidential settings. So it helps on the residential side but also with the nonresidential outpatient side. Helping these women and helping these babies is just one aspect of this bill, but it is a very critical one. As we work to turn the tide in the struggle against addiction, it is one on which we should all be focused. The good news is that the bipartisan momentum we have seen here tonight is building. I think the Senate is ready to move on this legislation this week. There are other amendments that have been filed. The deadline was today. I hope we will have the opportunity to go through some more amendments, as we did last week, but meanwhile, we have strong support and strong momentum, as we saw tonight, on both sides of the aisle. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have lined up to support this legislation. We need to pass this bill and get it signed into law so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives of people we represent. As the heroin epidemic in Ohio and around the country has reached crisis level, I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill over the finish line here in the Senate and then get it passed in the House, where there is companion legislation, and then on to the President's desk and enable this Congress to play a role as a better partner with State and local governments and with our nonprofits around this country to address this growing heroin epidemic around our entire country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Miners Protection Act Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last week I met with Rita Lewis of Westchester, OH, in southwest Ohio. She was here to testify in front of the Senate Committee on Finance in honor of her late husband Butch. Butch worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. I would also add that Butch had been drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates to play baseball some 45 years ago. Instead, he enlisted to go into the U.S. Army and on to Vietnam. He was injured and could never play baseball again competitively. He came back and became a trucker and joined the Teamsters. As I said, he worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. But for Butch and Rita and thousands more Ohio retirees, that promise is under threat. Truckers and mine workers in Ohio and across the country are facing crippling cuts to the benefits they have earned. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act that Congress passed 2 years ago allows pension trustees to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of retirees when a plan is running low on funds. This is disgraceful. If a pension fund is in bad shape, it is our job to fix it, not break promises to American workers who have worked their whole lives to earn that pension. I believed that 2 years ago when I voted against that law which allowed these proposed cuts, and I believe it more strongly now. That is why I am calling on the Treasury Department to reject and to reject immediately the proposed cuts to the Central States Teamsters' pension. I am calling for us to immediately mark up and pass the Miners Protection Act, which will protect the benefits Ohio workers earned over a lifetime of work. Under MEPRA, the bill I talked about a moment ago, multiemployer pension trustees such as Central States are now able to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of participants and retirees if the plans are in ``critical and declining status.'' Pension trustees for plans in ``critical and declining status'' may submit an application for proposed benefit cuts to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Central States pension plan trustees used the authority of MEPRA to propose cuts of as much as 70 percent, but in their own application, they admit that even with these drastic cuts, their plan--get this-- still only has a 50.4-percent chance of remaining solvent. In other words, they are asking Treasury to approve massive, life-shattering cuts to hundreds of thousands of workers for what amounts to a coin flip. Treasury should immediately reject this application. Put yourself--this is something we don't do well around here--put yourself in the place of a worker who has planned for her retirement with her family. She expected a $2,000-a-month pension on top of $1,200 a month in Social Security, and she all of a sudden finds out her pension is cut 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent. That was the money she planned to live on. She has some savings, but all that was calculated because it was a promise from this pension plan to honor that commitment of decades earlier. As I said, Treasury should immediately reject this application. The mine workers' pension plan and the others are too far gone to use MEPRA. The United Mine Workers of America's 1974 pension plan covers 100,000 mine workers, including thousands of miners in eastern and southern Ohio. It was almost completely funded before the financial collapse of 7 years ago brought on by Wall Street overreach and greed, but the plan was devastated by the recession. It has too few assets, too few employers, and too few union workers paying in. If Congress fails to act, thousands of retired miners could lose their health care this year and the entire plan could fail as early as next year. There is a bipartisan solution that is proposed by Senator Manchin, Senator Casey, me, and others and supported by leaders of both parties. If it were brought to the floor today, it would pass with an overwhelming majority. It is time for the Senate to act. The Committee on Finance should mark up this legislation this week. The Senate should bring it to the floor immediately. Miners worked in dangerous jobs--dangers from a mining accident, an explosion, or a collapse every day when they went to work, and dangerous in the sense that so many mine workers die early because of premature bronchial illnesses and heart ailments brought on by working in the mines. They have worked underground their whole lives to put food on the table, to send their kids to school, and to help power this country. Truckers criss-cross the State and country to pay their bills and support their families and drive our economy forward. They all deserve the full pension and health benefits they were promised and they worked a lifetime to earn. Butch Lewis led the Southwest Retirees Pension Committee's fight against cuts to their earned benefits. He passed away on New Year's Eve due to a stroke, which doctors have attributed [[Page S1313]] at least in part to the stress he faced over the proposed pension cuts not just to him and his family but to the workers he was fighting for as a union activist. The benefits to his widow, his wife Rita, have already been cut. She faces an additional 40-percent reduction because of the proposed cuts put forth by Central States. Butch said the cuts being forced on retirees--his words--``amount to a war against the middle class and the American dream.'' He is right. Ohio's retired workers have earned their pensions and their retirement savings over a lifetime of hard work. It was promised to them, whether they worked behind a desk, on the factory floor, down in the coal mines, or behind a wheel. We should honor Butch's memory by continuing his work. That means coming together to support a bipartisan solution to protect Rita's benefits and the pensions of tens of thousands of retired Teamsters and retired mine workers. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_149.csv,78815,78815,78881,"[congressional record volume 162, number 36 (monday, march 7, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1303-s1313] from

call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. markey. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the acting president pro tempore. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. markey. madam president, before i begin, as we discuss the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, i would like to take a moment to thank senator whitehouse for his role in developing the bill and bringing it this far. i also convey my gratitude to minority leader reid and the ranking member of the judiciary committee, senator leahy, for their excellent staffs and for urging that my amendments--which i will address momentarily--be a part of the discussion and for managing the negotiations on this bill. i also thank senator murray, the ranking member of the help committee, for help and counsel on amendments. let us pause for a moment and consider the causes of the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic gripping our country. understanding the causes will help us focus on the right solutions. three distinct parties bear much of the blame for this public health crisis. first, there is big pharma. in the mid-1990s, the seeds of this epidemic [[page s1304]] were planted with the aggressive, misleading, and ultimately criminal marketing of the powerful opioid painkiller, oxycontin by purdue pharma. perdue claimed oxycontin was not addictive and couldn't be abused. neither of those claims turned out to be true. purdue pharma built a massive marketing and sales program for oxycontin. from 1996 to 2000, purdue pharma's sales force more than doubled from more than 300 sales representatives to almost 700 sales representatives. in 2001 alone, purdue gave out $40 million in bonuses to its burgeoning sales force. as a result of these sales and marketing efforts, from 1997 to 2002, oxycontin prescriptions increased almost tenfold, from 670,000 in 1997 to 6.2 million in 2002. purdue's marketing of oxycontin broke the law. in 2007, purdue pharma paid $600 million in fines and other payments after pleading guilty in federal court to misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the risks of addiction to oxycontin and its potential for abuse. second, purdue pharma's criminal wrongdoing did not occur in a vacuum. the federal government helped to enable this epidemic. the federal drug enforcement administration is responsible for approving the annual production quotas for pharmaceutical companies to manufacture oxycodone, the principal ingredient in oxycontin. from 1996 to 2016, the drug enforcement administration obliged big pharma and increased by almost 150 percent the amount of oxycodone authorized for manufacture. in 1996, the dea authorized u.s. pharmaceutical companies to make the equivalent of 6 billion 10-milligram oxycontin pills. by 2016, that figure had increased to almost 14 billion 10-milligram pills. that is right. today the drug enforcement administration is telling big pharma it is ok to make 14 billion oxycontin pills to sell in the united states in 1 year. the federal food and drug administration was also complicit, approving new opioid after new opioid. in the process, the fda, charged with ensuring the safety of all prescription drugs on the u.s. market, began turning a blind eye to outside experts who were warning of the dangers these drugs posed. in 2013, an expert panel established to review the powerful new opioid painkiller zohydro, voted 11 to 2 against recommending its approval, but the fda approved the drug anyway, overruling the concerns voiced by experienced physicians on the panel. in 2014, in the wake of the zohydro decision, the fda twice skipped the advisory committee process altogether when it approved two new prescription opioids. then, in august of 2015, the fda did it again. this time it bypassed an advisory committee of outside experts on the question of a new use for oxycontin for children aged 11 to 16. the fda even ignored its own rules that specifically call for advisory committee advice when a committee of pediatric dosing is involved. it was clear that the fda was intentionally choosing to forgo advisory committees in order to avoid another overwhelming zohydro-like vote, recommending against approval of a prescription opioid and in order to avoid any impediments to new opioids being sold in the united states. finally, the medical profession must bear its fair share of responsibility for this crisis. doctors are prescribing opioids at an alarming rate. in 2012, america's doctors wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain relievers, enough pills for every single american adult to have a bottle of opioid pills given to them in the year 2012. and america's doctors are dangerously uninformed about the drugs they are prescribing. a recent survey of 1,000 physicians nationwide found that ``only two-thirds correctly reported that the most common route of abuse was swallowing pills whole.'' it is unconscionable that our doctors are so ill-informed. nearly half of the doctors surveyed also erroneously reported that so-called abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids were less addictive than their counterparts. abuse-deterrent opioids are supposed to be harder to crush, so they are harder to snort or to mix with liquid and inject, but abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids are just as addictive as non-abuse-deterrent opioids. whether an opioid is abuse-deterrent or not hasn't prevented tens of thousands of people who have had their wisdom teeth removed or experienced lower back pain from getting addicted to these painkillers simply by swallowing them. so what is the result of the combination of big pharma's marketing of prescription opioids, the federal government's repeatedly approving them in ever-increasing numbers, and our doctors writing millions of prescriptions for them? today, the united states is less than 5 percent of the world's population but we consume 80 percent of the world's opioid painkillers. we have become the united states of oxy. when prescriptions run out or the price of oxy pills on the street become too high for those who have become addicted, they turn to cheaper heroin, which shares the same molecular structure as oxycontin. eighty percent of the people suffering from heroin addiction started with opioid pain medications approved by the fda and prescribed by doctors. in 2014, nearly 33,000 people died of an opioid overdose in this country. almost 1,300 of those deaths were in my home state of massachusetts. i had hoped to offer amendments to cara to address both the causes of this epidemic and to provide treatment for those suffering from the results. one of my amendments would have required the fda to convene advisory committees for all prescription opioid approval questions. after i placed a hold on the nomination of dr. robert califf to serve as fda commissioner, the agency announced it would only commit to convene advisory committees for non-abuse-deterrent opioids. the fda refused to agree to convene advisory committees to inform all of its opioid-approval decisions. we need legislation requiring the fda to seek expert advice about the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids, and i will continue to fight to require advisory committees at the fda. we also need legislation requiring doctors to get and stay educated about the dangers of the pills they are prescribing in record numbers. stopping the overprescription of opioid painkillers is a critical step. we need to ensure that all prescribers of these opioid painkillers are educated in the dangers of these drugs, how easily individuals can become addicted, and when and how to appropriately prescribe. the doctors say that they do not want education to be mandated, that it should be voluntary. well, the fda has had voluntary education for opioid prescribers in place since 2013 and has been actively encouraging doctors to take these voluntary education programs, but in more than 2 years, only 12 percent of prescribers have actually completed fda's voluntary education program. it is imperative that any provider who is applying for a federal dea license to prescribe opioids have completed mandatory education on the basics of opioid prescribing and the inherent risk of addiction. my amendment would have done just that. it would have required basic education as a condition of a dea license to prescribe these painkillers, and i will continue to fight to require prescriber education. finally, we need to remove the barriers to effective treatment, including outdated federal restrictions on medication-assisted therapies such as suboxone. medication-assisted therapy for opioid addiction is cost effective, decreases overdose deaths, and reduces transmission of hiv and hepatitis c. unlike other treatment regimens for any other disease, physicians are severely limited in the number of patients they can treat with medication-assisted therapies such as suboxone, contributing to long wait-lists and an inability of patients to get treatment for their addiction when they need it. of approximately 2.5 million americans who abused or were dependent on opioids, fewer than 1 million received treatment for their condition, partly because of the already existing federal instructions. senator rand paul of kentucky and i have a bipartisan bill, the recovery enhancement for addiction treatment act, or treat act, which has broad stakeholder support, including the american medical association and nurse practitioners. it emphasizes quality of care and closes this gaping [[page s1305]] hole in our addiction treatment system. we had hoped to offer treat as an amendment to cara. we will continue to fight for it and are hopeful the help committee will include it in the substance abuse legislation the committee will soon consider. my collaboration with senator paul shows that whether it is the commonwealth of massachusetts or the commonwealth of kentucky, this crisis is the same. it doesn't discriminate by geography, by age, by race, by socioeconomic status, or by employment. it requires a bipartisan effort. thirty years ago, nancy reagan told us to just say no to drugs. today we have to go further. we have to say enough is enough. we have to recognize what has worked and what hasn't worked. in the past, we believed we could incarcerate our way out of the problem. that did not work. so instead of ignoring and incarcerating, let's avow and act. let's destigmatize, not criminalize. let's treat, not retreat. let's have a comprehensive plan which we put in place that deals with the pharmaceutical companies, the physicians, and the kinds of treatment patients need across our country so that they get the help they need. that is our job. i continue to believe we can do this in a bipartisan fashion as long as we understand the magnitude of the problem and what the causes of it were and continue to be and will be into the future unless and until we put these safeguards in place. so i am looking forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. i compliment them for the work they have done so far in bringing this bill to the floor of the senate this week, but i do believe there is more to be done. as long as this many americans are addicted, as long as this much oxycontin and opioids are put into our system, then we are going to find that this heroin epidemic we have in our country, which is directly related, will continue to spiral out of control. i want to work with all my colleagues. i thank my colleagues for all the work they have done so far, but there is much work to be done in the future. madam president, i yield the floor. the acting president pro tempore. the senator from alabama. mr. sessions. madam president, i would like to talk for a few minutes about the crime problem we have in america today, the dramatically increasing problem of heroin abuse. over the last week, we have had a lot of discussion about this crisis, which i am afraid we are just on the cusp of. i think it is going to get worse, based on my experience and my best judgment, but the effort to understand and address it has been going on for a while. in january, we had a good hearing on this issue in the senate judiciary committee, and i want to mention a few things i think we ought to keep in mind as we address this very important problem. just as background, i served 15 years as a prosecutor, 12 as a u.s. attorney, a federal prosecutor, and 2\1/2\ as an assistant u.s. attorney. so that was my background when i came here. i was very active and studied the drug and crime problem in america, and i learned some things. there are cycles in this, and people wrote about it over the years. i think we are, unfortunately, moving into another cycle, and we have to be very careful. it is so painful to have a large prison population. we don't want to have that. year after year, everybody wants to look for alternatives to prison, and we have tried, but if you go too far, you end up not having sufficient consequences for crime, not detaining dangerous offenders, and you end up increasing crime, increasing deaths of americans from murders and other things, increasing heroin and serious drug problems that destroy families, destroy lives, destroy communities, and result in violence and death. it is a very real problem. a lot of people think, well, if you want to use heroin, so be it. well, these people can't function. how are they going to survive? they either steal or they get on welfare or they have to go to treatment. and who pays for it, since they do not have any money? we have proven and seen for decades that drug use can be brought down, fewer people can become addicted. in the early 1980s, nancy reagan, as president reagan's wonderful wife, formed the ``just say no'' program, and hundreds of thousands of volunteers nationwide in every community in america got together in their communities--they got the treatment community, the law enforcement community, the prevention community, the education community, and the schools--and they worked and worked and crafted policies that would create a climate of hostility for the use of dangerous drugs. the idea was to bring down the use. as a result, the use of illegal drugs dropped by half. it took us 15 or more years, but it dropped by half steadily. what a tremendous victory. in 1980, half of our high school seniors admitted they had used an illegal drug sometime in that year. what an unbelievable number. it had been going up steadily, it peaked, and then it began to go down under this sustained effort. what i have been worried about for some time, and have warned about it, is that if you don't maintain that but start going in the other direction, you can expect drug use to increase. it is that simple. and it is happening. lives--and young people's lives--will be destroyed by this, families will break up, and children will be scarred. drug use is no fun, innocent thing. it is destructive. if this nation is using half as much illegal drugs as before, it is a better nation. it just is. and if we double the amount of drug use in america, it will be a more dangerous nation and not as good a nation. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, over 47,000 people died from drug overdoses in the united states in 2014. in 2014, 47,000 died. that is one drug overdose death for every 12 minutes. and 61 percent of those overdoses involved opioids. the rate of all opioid overdoses in the united states has tripled since 2000. overdoses have tripled since 2000. heroin overdose deaths specifically have increased sixfold since 2001--600 percent--and have more than tripled in just the past 4 years alone. according to the national survey on drug use and health, there were approximately 169,000 new heroin users in 2013. according to the substance abuse and mental health services administration, in 2004, approximately 589,000 people in the united states had an opioid use disorder. we used to call that addiction--a problem. it is affecting their lives. the drug enforcement administration's 2015 national drug threat assessment noted that ``drug overdose deaths have become the leading cause of injury death in the united states, ahead of motor vehicle deaths and firearms.'' this is a significant matter. as dea acting administrator chuck rosenberg, a bright, young mind appointed by president obama, noted last july that ``[a]pproximately 120 people die each day in the united states of a drug overdose.'' some argue that the increase in heroin abuse is due to over- prescription of opioids from prescription drugs--you get addicted from a prescription drug, and then you move to heroin. i am sure that has some validity, but according to a january 14, 2016, study published in the new england journal of medicine, one of the premier authoritative medical journals in the world: in the majority of studies, the increase in the rates of heroin use preceded the change in prescription-opioid policies, and there is no consistent evidence of an association between the implementation of policies related to prescription opioids and increases in the rates of heroin use or deaths, although the data are relatively sparse. alternatively, heroin market forces-- please hear this, colleagues-- alternatively, heroin market forces, including increased accessibility, reduced price, and high purity of heroin appear to be major drivers of the recent increases in rates of heroin use. so it is purity, price, and accessibility. while treatment and accountability are critical to breaking the cycle of addiction, it is not the whole solution. we must also reduce the availability of heroin--we simply have to do that--and other illicit opioids. in december of last year, the centers for disease control and prevention director tom frieden said it is important ``that law enforcement''--a lot of people don't want to talk about this. we have police officers, sheriffs' deputies, federal agents, drug enforcement [[page s1306]] agents, and border patrol agents. he said it is important ``that law enforcement intensify efforts to reduce the availability of heroin, illegal fentanyl, and other illegal opioids.'' similarly, drug enforcement administration acting administrator rosenberg said in the dea's national drug threat assessment that, in addition to providing treatment to addicted opioid abusers, ``law enforcement must continue to have the tools it needs to attack criminal groups who facilitate drug addiction.'' i have been there. i was part of law enforcement's efforts. i invested a tremendous amount of my time in the coalition for a drug free mobile, the partnership for youth, bay area drug council--groups like that--working on a volunteer basis to change the use of drugs in the community. law enforcement was always a critical part of it, and law enforcement does have the capability in ways that others don't to reduce the availability, make purity levels less, and otherwise restrict, raising the price of an illegal drug. the dea's 2015 national drug threat assessment confirms this. they studied the price of the drugs. one thing that tells us whether or not law enforcement and interdiction are effective is to discover if the price is going up or down. mexican drug cartels are flooding the united states with cheap heroin and methamphetamine. when i was a young prosecutor, it was coming from turkey, the middle east, and that was pretty much shut off. president carter did some good things. i was an assistant u.s. attorney and came back a few years later as a u.s. attorney, but during that time they somehow reduced the supply of heroin from the middle east. as a result, heroin addiction dropped all over the country, and very little heroin was in the heartland of america--mainly just in the big cities. we are also getting cheap methamphetamine from across the mexican border, which is wide open. the statistics from the dea drug threat assessment confirm that, from 2010 to 2014, the amount of heroin seized every year at the southwest border has more than doubled. well, are we catching that much more? no, we are not catching, i am sure, any substantially larger percentage. we are just having a larger amount moving across the border. the price has fallen, so we know we have more. if prices stay low, more people will try it more often, and as the purity level is higher, more people will get addicted sooner and often die quicker. these drug cartels are partnering with criminal gangs and fueling violence in our cities and communities. according to dea's 2015 threat assessment, mexican drug cartels ``control drug trafficking across the southwest border and are moving to expand their presence in the united states, particularly in heroin markets.'' they import, transport, and are now actually selling it in our cities instead of just bringing it in across the border. in 2013, the heads of the chicago crime commission and the chicago office of the drug enforcement administration both named el chapo guzman, the infamous leader of the sinaloa cartel, as chicago's ``public enemy #1.'' so a man in mexico, moving heroin and methamphetamine into the united states and hammering chicago with it-- chicago named him as their no. 1 public enemy. it cannot be a coincidence, as the fbi's uniform crime statistics show, that the murder rate in chicago increased by approximately 18 percent during the first 6 months of 2015. at that rate, it is a 36 percent increase in murders in chicago in 1 year. this is an unbelievably dramatic surge in murders. another example is atlanta. dea's atlanta office reported an increase of heroin availability from a rating of ``stable'' in the first half of 2013 to ``high'' just a year later. according to the fbi's uniform crime statistics, the murder rate in atlanta increased by approximately 15 percent in the first 6 months of 2015. this is an unsustainable thing. the old rule is a 7-percent increase and your money doubles in 10 years. when you get 15- and 18-percent increases in 6 months--that's 30 percent in 1 year--you are doubling the crime rate, the murder rate, in 3 years. at a november hearing of the senate caucus on international narcotics control, i asked dea deputy administrator jack riley about these drug distribution networks and the people in local communities pushing the drugs, selling the drugs, and collecting the money. this money eventually ends up back in mexico, colombia, and south and central america, funding the evil, violent drug cartels that are destabilizing whole nations. he responded that it is ``almost as big a problem as the cartels themselves.'' when i asked him whether these drug traffickers are the ones causing the violence and death on our streets, he responded that ``they are the ones that regulate themselves by the barrel of a gun.'' if you want to collect a drug debt, you can't file a lawsuit in federal court. you collect it by the barrel of a gun. by its very nature, drug distribution networks are violent criminals. it has always been so, and it will always be so. conducting an illegal enterprise, they have to maintain discipline, and they use threats and violence to maintain it and collect their debts. we must not forget what became obvious in the early 1980s, when i was a u.s. attorney: drug dealers and their organizations are not nonviolent criminals. these are violent crimes. rather than enforcing the law and making it tougher on drug cartels by keeping our border secure, the obama administration has done exactly the opposite. our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to flood our country with cheap heroin, and the administration has made it clear that officers are not to deviate from the president's lawless immigration policy. they are blocked from doing their job and following their oath. just last week--and as someone who has worked closely with federal drug enforcement officers and immigration officers as a federal prosecutor--customs and border protection commissioner gil kerlikowske testified before the house committee on appropriations that ``if you don't want to follow the directions of your superiors, including the president of the united states and the commissioner of customs and border protection, then you really do need to look for another job.'' do you hear what he is saying there, colleagues? what he is saying is that if you want to do your job and enforce the laws as the laws are written, which we have ordered you not to do, and you go on and do it anyway, then look for another job. it is one of the most amazing things i have seen in my entire law enforcement career. ice officers-- immigration and customs enforcement officers--who enforce drug laws, along with immigration laws, these officers sued their supervisors. they sued their supervisors, alleging that they were being ordered to violate their oath to enforce the immigration laws of the united states by these restrictive policies. it is hard to overestimate the destruction the obama administration's policies--their executive amnesty, their refusal to sufficiently fund and man the border--are causing to law enforcement. a big part of this now is the openness to heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, and other drugs that are being imported. i take that statement by the commissioner of customs and border protection as a direct threat to those officers who want to follow their oath and do their duty. in august 2013, a dramatic event occurred that was too little appreciated. attorney general holder, the attorney general of the united states, ordered federal prosecutors not to charge certain drug offenders with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences that are in law. if you have so much drugs, you have a minimum penalty. you can get more than that, but you at least have to serve this minimum penalty. he ordered them not to charge those crimes. this is directing prosecutors not to follow the law. it has contributed to a decrease in the number of traffickers being prosecuted and convicted. according to data from the executive office for united states attorneys, at the end of 2015--in december--the 6-month average of drug prosecutions was down 21 percent compared to 5 years ago. and what are we seeing? a surge in crime, particularly drugs. excluding prosecutions in magistrate courts, the 6-month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. we haven't cut the number of drug prosecutors. we haven't cut the [[page s1307]] number of dea agents. this is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we have been doing for 25 years, and it is having an impact. i am afraid it is going to continue. meanwhile, state and local law enforcement agencies are not given the tools they need to continue taking these dangerous drug traffickers off of the streets. on december 21, 2015, the department of justice chose to stop all equitable sharing payments to state, local, and tribal partners under the asset forfeiture program. these are seized proceeds, moneys that are seized from drug dealers, big fancy cars and boats that they seize. for the last 20 years, federal and state officers worked together. the federal government has a good system for forfeiting the money. then, when the forfeiture is over, it is divided among the agencies. as a result, state and local people are willing to commit law officers to participate in these local task forces because they are helping clean up drugs in their community, helping identify and prosecute nationally significant drug dealers, and they get some compensation back from it when they find a truck full of money. i personally have seen cases where $1 million, $500,000, $800,000 in cash was seized from these people. some people think, oh, this is wrong; you shouldn't take their cash. this is the ill-gotten gain of an illegal enterprise and they should be able to keep it? they have no proof of any lawful source of this money. virtually every time, in addition, there is evidence to prove it is connected to drugs. half the time, they don't even show up to contest the seizure because they know they have no defense to it. this stops this sharing, and it is undermining the unity of effort that we really need to be successful. a joint letter signed by the international association of chiefs of police, the national association of police organizations, the major county sheriffs' association, the national sheriffs' association, the national district attorneys association, and the major cities chiefs association, pointed out that ``the suspension of equitable sharing payments may cause some agencies across the country to reconsider their ability to participate in joint task forces with the federal government.'' in other words, they are going to stop participating. ``the effects of this decision are far reaching and not only a disservice to law enforcement, but also to the public they are sworn to protect.'' mr. president, if there is a limit on my time or others are waiting to speak, i will wrap up. otherwise, i have about 5 minutes to wrap up. i see my colleague senator leahy, the ranking member of the judiciary committee. i don't want to block him. if my time is up, i will yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. coats). there is no time limit in place. mr. sessions. while law enforcement resources are being cut off, law enforcement officers are being blocked from doing their jobs, and drug prosecutions are being reduced, the administration and some in congress want to push and advance a criminal justice ``reform'' bill. but these proposals will have a tendency, i am afraid, to worsen the current problem by allowing for more reductions in sentences than are already occurring and early release of thousands of dangerous drug traffickers, and the weakening of penalties for those prosecuted under our drug trafficking laws, which have already been weakened--sending the wrong message at exactly the wrong time. i am very concerned about this. i love my colleagues, and i know their hearts are in the right place, but i am convinced we should not be heading in this direction at this time. make no mistake, federal prisons are not filled with low-level, nonviolent drug possessors. according to the bureau of justice statistics, 99.7 percent of drug offenders in federal prison at the end of fiscal year 2012 were convicted of drug trafficking offenses, not drug possession. drug trafficking is inherently violent activity, and it only serves to fund the drug cartels while fueling violence in our cities. according to the fbi, violent crime overall increased across the united states during the first half of 2015, by 6.2 percent for murders and 17 percent in the larger cities for murder--the largest single-year increase since at least 1960. already this year, homicides in chicago are double what they were all of last year. this is a complex subject. it is too soon to know the total reason for this increase, but it cannot go unnoticed that over the last decade the sentencing commission, which sets standards for sentencing in the united states--outside of the minimum mandatories that are set by our law passed by congress--has unilaterally imposed reductions in the sentences for drug inmates currently in prison. so we reduced the sentences for those in prison and they are getting out earlier. the most recent reduction in sentences resulted in the release of more than 46,000 drug traffickers--not drug possessors, drug traffickers--which has been wholeheartedly supported by the obama administration. according to bureau of justice statistics, 77 percent of drug offenders released were rearrested within 5 years. hear this now: 77 percent of these drug offenders were rearrested within 5 years, with 25 percent of those rearrested being rearrested for a violent crime-- somebody hurt, maybe dead. maybe that is part of the murder rate increase. take wendell callahan, a federal drug felon who was convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine and released early pursuant to the sentencing commission's directives. upon his early release, he proceeded to brutally murder his ex-girlfriend and her two little girls, 7 and 10. he would have been deep into a 12\1/2\-year federal sentence if it had been maintained, but the sentencing commission reduced it. the judge granted his petition for early release because of his ``good behavior'' in prison, and that led the judge to conclude he did not pose a danger to the safety of the public, even though in his background--when he was convicted and got the 12 years, he had previously been convicted in connection with a shooting offense and another drug offense. this is why you have to have some controls on judges. i have been there, and i saw it before the sentencing guidelines were passed. the federal prison population is at its lowest level since 2008. we are already on a downward course of the drug federal prison population being reduced. there are only 160,000 inmates in bureau of prisons custody today, well below its peak. the bureau of prisons has stated that this ``downward population trend is expected to continue into fiscal year 2017,'' bringing the federal prisons population to the lowest level since 2005. the population is up. crime is going up. the prison population is falling rather rapidly. admissions to federal prison have declined every year since 2011. you hear: we are filling our prisons. we are doing more and more. actually, there are other things that are already happening. it is happening in state prisons, too, where larger numbers are incarcerated than in the federal prisons. one of the reasons we are having this large decline in state prisons is not public safety but tight budgets. they are cutting back on the prison population to save money. we can be smarter. some people can be released early. i worked with my democratic colleague, senator durbin, 6 years ago, i believe, and we reduced the crack penalties more significantly than a lot of people know. i thought that was justified. but we are now proceeding well beyond that, and it is causing me great concern. the attorney general has ordered the prosecutors to not charge certain criminal offenses. reducing sentences and releasing felons is equivalent to reducing the cost to the criminal enterprise of their criminal activity. it reduces the cost, the risk. thus, crime--it is already rising--would further increase as a result of the criminal justice ``reform'' bill that would further reduce penalties. can we take a breath, and let's think about this? i don't say there aren't some things we can do that will allow for some reduction in the federal prison population. some people probably serve more time than is absolutely necessary. but in truth, we have seen dramatic improvements over nearly 30 years, 25 years, in the reduction of crime. until this surge, murder rates were less than half what they were in 1980 when i became a federal prosecutor. drug use dropped dramatically [[page s1308]] when nancy reagan started the ``just say no'' program, and drug use began to steadily decrease. it is now beginning to steadily increase. you have to have leadership from washington. you can't have the president of the united states of america talking about marijuana like it is no different than taking a drink, saying i used marijuana when i was in high school and it is no different than smoking. it is different. and you are sending a message to young people that there is no danger in this process. it is false that marijuana use doesn't lead people to more drug use. it is already causing a disturbance in the states that have made it legal. i think we need to be careful about this. what if this is the beginning of another surge in drug use like we saw in the sixties and seventies that led to massive problems in our communities? the solution? well, we have to control the border. all the heroin and a big chunk of the methamphetamine is coming across the mexican border. we need barriers. we need more agents. people need to be arrested. they need to be deported. they don't get to be taken to some city in the united states they would like to go to and get released and asked to show up on bail, which they never do. that is an open invitation to illegality and illegal entry. we need to enforce our laws, and we have to make the consequences of drug trafficking a deterrent. we can do this. we have done it before, and it is all part and parcel with prevention programs, education programs, and treatment programs. all that has to be done, but it cannot be denied, in my opinion, that law enforcement plays a critical role in it. this means supporting, not blocking the efforts of law enforcement to do their jobs and giving them the tools to arrest drug traffickers and be effective at the border, putting them in jail, not giving them early release so they can commit more crimes. in january, a woman from ohio named tonda dare testified before the senate judiciary committee at a hearing on the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic. she shared the powerful story of her daughter, who died from a heroin overdose. she said this: one of the things that i see happening in our little town that frustrates me is . . . our officers have worked so diligently to arrest people that they know are bringing this [heroin] in. just [to] have them go in front of our judges and our judges just slapped these people on the wrist and sent them right back out the door. . . . the boy that sold my daughter the heroin that killed her just recently went back in front of a judge for his fourth offense for trafficking heroin. [it was the] fourth time he's been arrested for this and he was given five months. how [is] that possible? we can talk about making sure we have treatment and recovery for people who have been addicted, although many people never ever recover from addiction--except by the grave. that is the sad truth. we should make that a priority. but we cannot hope to solve these problems by only treating people on the back end of addiction without reducing the availability of those drugs and keeping the purity down and the cost up, not continuing to fall. we have to stop people from becoming addicts in the first place, and we can't let the fact that we have a heroin abuse epidemic cause us to forget that we have a drug trafficking epidemic too. law enforcement is prevention. experts tell us that the price, purity, and availability of drugs, especially heroin, fuels more consumption, more addiction, more crime, more death, and more human and family destruction. i wish it were not true. i wish there were more options, but law enforcement is a central part of this effort, and history proves it. i thank the chair and yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from vermont. 51st anniversary of bloody sunday mr. leahy. mr. president, today is the 51st anniversary of bloody sunday--a horrible abuse of american citizens that occurred in selma, al. each year we commemorate the events of that fateful day, because it helped transform our nation and proved to be a catalyst for the passage of the voting rights act. for the last two years, this commemoration has been a sad reminder of what five justices did to that cornerstone civil rights law. in shelby county v. holder a narrow majority of the court drove a stake through the heart of the voting rights act when it struck down the coverage formula for its preclearance provision in section 5. i mentioned that because under section 5 of the voting rights act, the federal government has the authority to examine and prevent racially discriminatory voting changes from going into effect before those changes disenfranchise voters in covered jurisdictions. by striking down the coverage formula that determined which states and jurisdictions were subject to federal review, the court rendered section 5 unenforceable. unfortunately, even though almost every single republican and democrat in the house and senate voted for the voting rights act, the supreme court, by a 1-vote margin--notwithstanding that 535 of us had voted--drove a stake through the heart of the voting rights act by striking down the coverage formula for its preclearance provisions in section 5. since then republican governors and state legislatures have exploited shelby county by enacting sweeping voter suppression laws that disproportionately prevent or discourage black americans from voting. this includes the state of alabama, which not only enacted a burdensome photo identification law after the decision, but then they made it even harder for many of its black citizens to obtain identification when the state closed more than 30 dmv offices in mostly poor, minority neighborhoods last october. it is hard to fathom that in 2016, well over 100 years after the civil war and passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the constitution, and after transformative moments, such as bloody sunday, that states would continue to pass laws and take actions that would undermine black americans' rights to vote. this past weekend, congresswoman terri sewell, who represents the 7th district of alabama--which includes shelby county, birmingham, and selma--held a public forum in birmingham to examine the harm caused by the supreme court's shelby county decision. several witnesses at that forum testified that the state had made it harder for their citizens to vote, and that a disproportionate number of those citizens were minorities. they also spoke about the urgent need to restore the protections of the voting rights act. congressman john lewis, our great civil rights hero, was in attendance, and it is heartbreaking to realize that so many of the gains that he was able to help secure through his civil rights activism are being undone today. despite the compelling testimony about the urgent need for congress to address voting rights, most republicans in congress continue to disregard the urgency of this issue. more than two and a half years since the shelby county decision, and despite the introduction of two separate bipartisan bills that would restore the protections of the voting rights act, the republican chairs of the judiciary committee from both houses of congress refuse to even hold a hearing on this issue. instead, republican leaders have only paid lip service to the issue, supporting the award of congressional medals for brave civil rights leaders. that is not enough. recently, the speaker of the house stated that he was supportive of one of the bipartisan voting rights restoration bills. in the same statement he explained that nothing could be done because the republican chair of the house judiciary committee refuses to take up the bill or to have a hearing. this is not leadership. the american people expect more than talk. this pattern of republican obstruction reached unprecedented heights recently when a few senate republicans declared that they would not even hold a hearing for the next supreme court nominee even before the president has even announced a nominee. republicans have apparently decided that rather than be transparent and hold public hearings and votes on the most significant issues of the day--including voting rights, comprehensive immigration reform, and the next supreme court nominee--they would simply shut down the process. instead they are making important and timely decisions affecting hundreds of millions of americans behind closed doors. it is [[page s1309]] not good for our democracy and it is not good for the american people. we need hearings and a vote on the voting rights bills. and we need a hearing and a vote on the next supreme court nominee. we remember what came to be known as bloody sunday because the blood that was shed led to greater democratic participation and a more inclusive union. what republicans are doing now undermines the hard-fought legacy of bloody sunday and the civil rights movement. for the good of the nation, i urge that republican leaders in the senate and the house change that shameful course. mr. president, the senate will soon vote to bring us one step closer to passage of the comprehensive addiction and recovery act or cara. last week i suggested that we stay in session and do our job on thursday, friday, and saturday so we could finish the bill, but i understand the republican leadership wanted to take a long weekend, so we did not finish it, but now we can. i am a cosponsor of this bill because it addresses the growing problem of prescription opioid and heroin addiction that has had devastating impacts on communities all over the country, including my home state of vermont. this bill represents an important shift in the way we approach the issue of substance abuse and addiction. it sets a comprehensive framework to reduce opioid deaths, prevent addiction, and improve treatment. it will also help those who suffer from opioid use disorders achieve recovery, and perhaps most importantly this bill reflects the consensus of this body that the nation cannot arrest or jail its way out of this addiction problem. since my first field hearing in rutland, vt, on this topic in 2008, i have been inspired by how my fellow vermonters across the political spectrum have shaped the discussion about this public health crisis and how they have served as a model for communities across the nation. i certainly feel this bill represents important progress, but we cannot be satisfied with just passing this one bill. we also need a significant commitment of targeted funding so we can carry out and implement the programs authorized by this bill. it is one thing to say we are going to authorize these great programs even though we are not going to pay for them, but don't you feel good that we authorized them. now we can all go home and tell our constituents we care. we authorized it, but we will not pay for it. at least senator shaheen stood and proposed an amendment that would have provided emergency funding to do just that. her vital amendment had the support of a majority in this body, but republican senators blocked it from being considered and adopted. it is unfortunate because senator shaheen's amendment would have provided the resources to strengthen both the law enforcement and public health components that would have delivered the necessary resources to health care professionals all over the country who are overwhelmed by a need they cannot meet. i believe there is bipartisan agreement that we have to stop the loss of life caused by opioid abuse. there should be a bipartisan agreement to provide the money necessary to do so. there is an opportunity to make the bill better. many members have filed amendments to improve cara. a number of amendments were filed by both republicans and democrats. unfortunately, the republican leader has not allowed us to have an open amendment process, and contrary to what he said earlier, a number of senators have been blocked from offering their amendments. i tried to work--and did in a bipartisan way with senators grassley, whitehouse, and klobuchar--to consider this bill and report it to the senate floor. we have continued our bipartisan effort to reach agreement on a number of amendments that could improve the bill. i hope those important bipartisan efforts will continue this week so we can consider these amendments and have final passage this week. let us have an open process. these amendments can be voted on up or down or adopted by consent. it is one thing for us to talk about what we want to do, it is another thing to have the courage to vote for it. if we do not vote for it, we are just voting maybe. let us vote yes or no. as we work toward senate passage of cara, our goal should be to make this the best bill possible. addiction is nothing less than an epidemic and cara treats it like one. this bill demonstrates that congress now sees addiction for what it is--a public health crisis all over our country. we need to equip our communities with both the programs and resources they need to get ahead of addiction. cara will save lives. it is worth putting the money in there to make sure it works. mr. president, i see the distinguished senior senator from west virginia on the floor, and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from west virginia. mr. manchin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. manchin. mr. president, i wish to thank the senior senator from vermont, who is a dear friend of mine. as he knows, this is a problem. it is an epidemic all over this country. no state is immune from it. it doesn't matter whether you are a democrat or republican. it has no home. it attacks and literally eradicates all of us, and it causes extreme hardships for all the families. i know the presiding officer, who is from indiana, is aware of this problem. every week i have come to the floor to read letters from people who have been affected by addiction in west virginia and other states. i have a letter from the presiding officer's home state of indiana, and i have a letter from my state too. this is something we have been fighting. the cara act is a bipartisan piece of legislation. it is not going to be a cure-all, but it starts in the right direction for us to start looking at opioid addiction and prescription drug abuse, not as much as we have in the past as a crime but as an illness, and an illness needs to have treatment. i think we are moving in that direction. politically we are accepting this, and we are going to basically meet that need of treatment which is so few and far between. we have 51 people dying every day. in my little, beautiful state of west virginia, just last year we lost over 600 lives to prescription drug abuse, and i have a state with less than 2 million people. from 1999 to 2013 there has been an increase of over 700 percent. this is a product which has come on the market that is greater than anything we have ever seen. we hope the fda gets serious about this. they are hearing us loud and clear. dr. califf was not someone whom i supported. i am very hopeful he will do a great job, and i will support him. he needs to step up to the plate and change the culture of the fda. the reason i say that is because the fda has to take their role seriously and not just approve drugs because it meets a certain criteria but also needs to realize the impact it has on the well-being of the families who have been addicted and affected. they need to consider the devastating public health impacts of its repeated decisions to approve all of these drugs that don't need to be on the market. we are very hopeful for that. the thing that brings that to mind is that it took us forever to get vicodin and lortab from a schedule iii to a schedule ii. it took us over 3 years. once we did, it took about 1 billion pills off the market, which resulted in a 22-percent decrease in vicodin and lortab, which were being passed out like m&ms. we know it can save lives. yet they came right back with zohydro, which was against the wishes of their advisory committee. we believe it is imperative that they have an advisory committee for every opioid they want to bring to the market. they must listen to the advisory committee. if the fda--the commissioner and his staff--wishes to go ahead and put a product on the market that is recommended not to be on the market from their advisory committee, they should come before us in congress and tell us why they believe this potent drug such as zohydro is needed when it is against the recommendations of these experts and specialists. we have been flooded with these stories. i will read a story from the presiding officer's state of indiana first. [[page s1310]] the girl's name is danielle. she says: i live in southern indiana and work as a server. about 2\1/2\ years ago a customer by the name of josh harvey left me his number. at the time, he told me he was living in chicago for school. little did i know he was in rehab there. granted, i didn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in constant contact. about a year or so ago i found out about his heroin addiction. he still told me little about it. i do know it started out with prescription pills and later went into heroin when the pills became harder to get. he served a month in jail in michigan, for the entire month of this past july, over a heroin-related charge. he came home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. luckily, his dad saved him that time. now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient program doing better--or so we all thought. school let out for break and i guess it all went downhill. he came to me on november 4 telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. i suggested an inpatient program. he went to wellstone after he left my house, sat for several hours and finally was given a room. i went and checked on him two different times while he waited to make sure he was there. thursday i didn't receive any calls. friday nothing either. then, saturday morning, the 7th of november, his mother called me to break my heart. he had passed away that friday the 6th over in louisville and they didn't know who to contact until that saturday morning, i guess. he had checked himself out of wellstone, broke into his house, and took his xbox, which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. never in a million years did i think i would become close to anybody addicted to heroin. it doesn't discriminate. it can get a hold of anyone and everybody. never in my life have i been so depressed or heartbroken. all i want is his story shared. he was my happy ending gone way too soon. that was from our friend in indiana who wanted to share her story with us. let me tell you about amanda, who lives in west virginia. amanda said: i walked into our new apartment. although we had only spent 2 nights there, it already felt like home. i was so excited to move in with nate. we had been on the fence between being best friends and a couple, and making the decision to move in together had finally settled years of uncertainty. as i turned the corner, i was surprised to see that he was in the exact same position as when i had left for my morning classes. i knew it had been a rough night of ``partying,'' but i thought he would be up to start our busy day of painting and moving. i touched his chest to feel the rise and fall, something that, as a mother, i had been doing to sleeping children for years. there was movement. he was breathing. i breathed a quick sigh of relief. i walked to the back of the apartment to set down my things, and that is when i realized i needed to go and get some things from my old apartment, and i started to leave. my hand was on the doorknob, but something stopped me in my tracks. to this day, i don't know why i turned around. i laid down beside nate, and i put my arm on his chest. he was not breathing, and when i looked up at his face, his eyes were wide open, but it was obvious that he was not there. the paramedics revived him to the point that he survived in a coma for 1 week. at one point while in the hospital, his eyes opened, and i thought that our nightmare was over, but it was just a muscle reflex and false hope. on january 30, 2007, prescription drugs took the life of nathan keith dunn, age 24. tall, dark, and handsome is what the world saw. intelligent, funny, witty, loving, and kind were the qualities seen by those who knew nate best. he was my best friend, my musical soulmate, and my sounding board. we were inseparable, and i began to experience an ache in my heart that, 9 years later, still occasionally brings me to my knees. but that is just who nate was to me. he was also the older son of a mother who had left years of abuse at the hands of her husband in order to find a better life for her sons. he was the brother to--and the only soft spot of--a boy who had been hardened growing up on the streets of a town outside of houston, tx. it seemed as if the only thing that ever kept him grounded was nate's love. they had one another's back in the best and worst of times. nate was also the instant crush of any girl who ever laid her eyes upon him. he was the best friend of anyone who knew him. i often wonder who and where he would be today. but i guess i will just have to wonder forever. i wish this was the end of my story about how prescription drugs have affected my life, but it is not even close to the end. for longer than i care to admit, drugs have been part of my everyday life. shortly after nate's death, i became addicted to prescription opiates. at first, they were prescribed by my doctor. eventually, i couldn't get through a day without them. i was what is sometimes referred to as a ``functioning addict,'' although it is fair to say that such a thing does not exist. to the outside world, i appeared to be fine, normal even. i held a job. i cared for my young sons. i kept a tidy home. meanwhile, my tolerance was building, and i began to require more and more of the drugs just to feel normal, just to get through each day. can you imagine living this life in which you wake up each day wondering if you have enough of the drug you need just to be ok for that day? so many people are facing this every single day. it could be the person sitting next to you. it could be your child's teacher. even worse, it could be your own child. the first thing to suffer was my financial situation. every dime i had was spent on the drugs that would allow me to function today, tomorrow, and if i am lucky, the next. then, my relationships with friends and family began to fail. it was painfully obvious that i was stealing from them. next, i couldn't keep a job--a record that will haunt me for the rest of my life. how could i go to work? how could i continue on? then, a catalyst walked into my life. i met a very good man. as we became closer, i realized that i couldn't bring myself to tell him that i was a drug addict. this is a silent killer. nobody speaks; they all keep it very quiet. mr. president, if i may have about 1 minute to finish up, i would appreciate it. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. manchin. thank you, mr. president. very few people know what is actually happening in your life. in order to get help, you have to be willing to openly talk about your issues, and most of us fear being harshly judged--and rightfully so. trying to treat a person with addiction issues by using medication only or therapy only is like trying to extinguish a raging house fire with a garden hose. she said: i was fortunate enough to have found a medication-based treatment program in my area, which is paid for by my insurance. she is going to move forward, and she wanted this story to be told. she said she wanted people to know how difficult it is. what we need to know as policymakers is how hard it is for people in our states who realize they need help and can't find it. so what i ask all of us to do--this cara bill is a step in the right direction. it is a piece of legislation that is much needed. as we move forward today on this piece of legislation, i hope we will find basically the support that people are needing to fight this opiate addiction. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor. cloture motion the presiding officer. pursuant to rule xxii, the chair lays before the senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. the legislative clerk read as follows: cloture motion we, the undersigned senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule xxii of the standing rules of the senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on senate amendment no. 3378, the substitute amendment to s. 524, a bill to authorize the attorney general to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. mitch mcconnell, chuck grassley, deb fischer, john barrasso, shelley moore capito, roy blunt, johnny isakson, john boozman, mike crapo, david vitter, mike rounds, bill cassidy, james [[page s1311]] e. risch, lindsey graham, john mccain, thom tillis, orrin g. hatch. the presiding officer. by unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. the question is, is it the sense of the senate that debate on amendment no. 3378, as amended, offered by the senator from iowa, mr. grassley, to s. 524, shall be brought to a close? the yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senators are necessarily absent: the senator from texas (mr. cruz), the senator from alaska (ms. murkowski), the senator from florida (mr. rubio), the senator from pennsylvania (mr. toomey), and the senator from louisiana (mr. vitter). further, if present and voting, the senator from pennsylvania (mr. toomey) would have voted ``yea.'' mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from california (mrs. boxer), the senator from delaware (mr. carper), the senator from missouri (mrs. mccaskill), the senator from maryland (ms. mikulski), the senator from florida (mr. nelson), and the senator from vermont (mr. sanders) are necessarily absent. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote? the yeas and nays resulted--yeas 86, nays 3, as follows: [rollcall vote no. 32 leg.] yeas--86 alexander

the nays are 3. three-fifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. the senator from ohio. mr. portman. mr. president, that is good news. the presiding officer just announced the results of the vote, and that is good news because it means the senate has just taken another step toward the passage of cara, the comprehensive addiction and recovery act. i see my colleague senator whitehouse is on the floor. i thank him and thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving forward on this legislation that will help us to save friends, family members, our neighbors, and communities that are struggling with addiction. this is a very important opportunity for us to be able to move forward on legislation that is comprehensive, that is bipartisan, and that has a companion bill on the house side, so there is a very good chance we could get this to the president's desk. it is the only bipartisan legislation that is comprehensive and evidence based, and it is critical we move forward with it. in addition to senator whitehouse, i also thank senator ayotte, senator klobuchar, and 42 bipartisan cosponsors for their support. frankly, more important to me is the support around the country this legislation has. i think senator whitehouse and i now have over 130 groups around the country that are supporting this legislation. this includes doctors, nurses, health care professionals, also law enforcement, people who are in the trenches dealing every day with treatment and recovery, and those who are focused on prevention and how to ensure people cannot just be treated for addiction but try to keep people out of the funnel of addiction. we started working on this legislation about 3 years ago. we started by hearing from experts around the country. we had five conferences in washington where we looked at all the issues, including criminal justice, women and addiction, the science of addiction, youth prevention, recovery issues, substance abuse impacting our veterans--a number of issues that enabled us to write legislation that actually makes sense, that will make a difference in our communities. these 130 groups around the country are focused on getting this bill passed because they know it is going to make a difference in our communities. if enacted, this will help states and communities develop and implement these evidence-based practices that we have looked at from around the country. it expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent prescription opioid abuse and the use of heroin and increases drug disposal sites to keep medications out of the hands of youth. it also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamine and expands the availability of the overdose reversal drugs such as naloxone, which are miracle drugs. it provides not just naloxone but also more training to our law enforcement officials, to firefighters, and to other emergency responders. in the criminal justice system, cara will help promptly identify and treat individuals suffering from substance abuse and expand diversion and education efforts to give individuals a second chance. frankly, it is going to help to get people into treatment rather than going into the criminal justice system. locking up people hasn't worked. if people are being arrested for possession alone, for using, this legislation will help to divert those people into the treatment to get them back on their feet. cara also authorizes resources to expand treatment in general, including medication-assisted treatment--again based on the research that has been done around the country. it allows veterans who were discharged for a substance abuse disorder to use drug courts as they recover. so it provides actual grants to these veterans treatment courts. they are doing a terrific job. i have toured these in ohio and talked to some of these veterans who have been through these programs. again, it helps get our veterans back on the right track. rather than ending in jail, they end up in a treatment program with other veterans helping them and supporting them, where they can begin to deal with their addiction and mental health issues. cara supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. this happens now at our colleges and universities increasingly. we want to support that. it also creates a task force on recovery to improve ways to address the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. one of the most important aspects of this legislation expands drug treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, babies who are born with addiction. recently, my wife jane and i visited rainbow babies and children's hospital in cleveland, oh. we toured the neonatal unit. if you haven't done this, it will break your heart because you will find there an increasing number of babies who are born, again, with this addiction, the neonatal abstinence syndrome. unfortunately, when you look at what has happened in ohio, we have had a 750-percent increase in the number of babies who are diagnosed with this neonatal abstinence syndrome just since 2004--a 750-percent increase. i am told in some of our states now 10 percent of the babies are being born addicted. i have also been at other hospitals around our state, including cincinnati children's hospital medical center and st. rita's special care nursery in lima, oh. last week my wife went to nationwide children's hospital in columbus. every single one of these children's hospitals is experiencing the same thing. what i have learned from these incredibly compassionate nurses and doctors who take these newborns [[page s1312]] through a withdrawal process is that the numbers of babies who have been exposed to heroin or prescription drugs continue to grow. the problem is getting worse, not better. these hospitals serve as yet another reminder that addiction is a disease. it is a disease that has to be treated like other diseases, and it is a disease that can impact anyone. it is wonderful that these caring nurses, doctors, and others are working to try to ensure that these babies become healthy. we don't know what the long-term consequences are, but we need to do more to avoid the addiction in the first place and better treat it when it occurs, and that is what this legislation does. specifically, the measure takes steps to help women and babies by expanding treatment for expectant and postpartum women and authorizing the department of health and human services to award grants to ensure that these women have access to evidence-based treatment services. that is in this legislation. it also reauthorizes residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction. there is a great center in columbus, oh, called amethyst. i had the opportunity to visit it. it is a treatment center, and the average length of stay there is almost 2 years. their results are unbelievable. they allow women to come with their babies, with their children, to go through treatment together. so there is hope. there are treatment centers doing a great job. we want to hold those up and encourage more of that around the country. finally, the legislation also creates a pilot program for state substance abuse agencies that allows funds to be used to target women who are addicted to opioids and provide family-based services to those women in nonresidential settings. so it helps on the residential side but also with the nonresidential outpatient side. helping these women and helping these babies is just one aspect of this bill, but it is a very critical one. as we work to turn the tide in the struggle against addiction, it is one on which we should all be focused. the good news is that the bipartisan momentum we have seen here tonight is building. i think the senate is ready to move on this legislation this week. there are other amendments that have been filed. the deadline was today. i hope we will have the opportunity to go through some more amendments, as we did last week, but meanwhile, we have strong support and strong momentum, as we saw tonight, on both sides of the aisle. both republican and democratic leaders have lined up to support this legislation. we need to pass this bill and get it signed into law so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives of people we represent. as the heroin epidemic in ohio and around the country has reached crisis level, i look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill over the finish line here in the senate and then get it passed in the house, where there is companion legislation, and then on to the president's desk and enable this congress to play a role as a better partner with state and local governments and with our nonprofits around this country to address this growing heroin epidemic around our entire country. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from ohio. miners protection act mr. brown. mr. president, last week i met with rita lewis of westchester, oh, in southwest ohio. she was here to testify in front of the senate committee on finance in honor of her late husband butch. butch worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. i would also add that butch had been drafted by the pittsburgh pirates to play baseball some 45 years ago. instead, he enlisted to go into the u.s. army and on to vietnam. he was injured and could never play baseball again competitively. he came back and became a trucker and joined the teamsters. as i said, he worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. but for butch and rita and thousands more ohio retirees, that promise is under threat. truckers and mine workers in ohio and across the country are facing crippling cuts to the benefits they have earned. the multiemployer pension reform act that congress passed 2 years ago allows pension trustees to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of retirees when a plan is running low on funds. this is disgraceful. if a pension fund is in bad shape, it is our job to fix it, not break promises to american workers who have worked their whole lives to earn that pension. i believed that 2 years ago when i voted against that law which allowed these proposed cuts, and i believe it more strongly now. that is why i am calling on the treasury department to reject and to reject immediately the proposed cuts to the central states teamsters' pension. i am calling for us to immediately mark up and pass the miners protection act, which will protect the benefits ohio workers earned over a lifetime of work. under mepra, the bill i talked about a moment ago, multiemployer pension trustees such as central states are now able to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of participants and retirees if the plans are in ``critical and declining status.'' pension trustees for plans in ``critical and declining status'' may submit an application for proposed benefit cuts to the u.s. treasury department. the central states pension plan trustees used the authority of mepra to propose cuts of as much as 70 percent, but in their own application, they admit that even with these drastic cuts, their plan--get this-- still only has a 50.4-percent chance of remaining solvent. in other words, they are asking treasury to approve massive, life-shattering cuts to hundreds of thousands of workers for what amounts to a coin flip. treasury should immediately reject this application. put yourself--this is something we don't do well around here--put yourself in the place of a worker who has planned for her retirement with her family. she expected a $2,000-a-month pension on top of $1,200 a month in social security, and she all of a sudden finds out her pension is cut 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent. that was the money she planned to live on. she has some savings, but all that was calculated because it was a promise from this pension plan to honor that commitment of decades earlier. as i said, treasury should immediately reject this application. the mine workers' pension plan and the others are too far gone to use mepra. the united mine workers of america's 1974 pension plan covers 100,000 mine workers, including thousands of miners in eastern and southern ohio. it was almost completely funded before the financial collapse of 7 years ago brought on by wall street overreach and greed, but the plan was devastated by the recession. it has too few assets, too few employers, and too few union workers paying in. if congress fails to act, thousands of retired miners could lose their health care this year and the entire plan could fail as early as next year. there is a bipartisan solution that is proposed by senator manchin, senator casey, me, and others and supported by leaders of both parties. if it were brought to the floor today, it would pass with an overwhelming majority. it is time for the senate to act. the committee on finance should mark up this legislation this week. the senate should bring it to the floor immediately. miners worked in dangerous jobs--dangers from a mining accident, an explosion, or a collapse every day when they went to work, and dangerous in the sense that so many mine workers die early because of premature bronchial illnesses and heart ailments brought on by working in the mines. they have worked underground their whole lives to put food on the table, to send their kids to school, and to help power this country. truckers criss-cross the state and country to pay their bills and support their families and drive our economy forward. they all deserve the full pension and health benefits they were promised and they worked a lifetime to earn. butch lewis led the southwest retirees pension committee's fight against cuts to their earned benefits. he passed away on new year's eve due to a stroke, which doctors have attributed [[page s1313]] at least in part to the stress he faced over the proposed pension cuts not just to him and his family but to the workers he was fighting for as a union activist. the benefits to his widow, his wife rita, have already been cut. she faces an additional 40-percent reduction because of the proposed cuts put forth by central states. butch said the cuts being forced on retirees--his words--``amount to a war against the middle class and the american dream.'' he is right. ohio's retired workers have earned their pensions and their retirement savings over a lifetime of hard work. it was promised to them, whether they worked behind a desk, on the factory floor, down in the coal mines, or behind a wheel. we should honor butch's memory by continuing his work. that means coming together to support a bipartisan solution to protect rita's benefits and the pensions of tens of thousands of retired teamsters and retired mine workers. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the career of Jacquelyne ``Jackie'' Brady, as she retires from her position as town manager for Laughlin, NV. For more than 20 years, Jackie Brady has been dedicated to serving the residents of Clark County. As the Laughlin town manager, Jackie has managed municipal services that Laughlin residents depend on and enjoy. Throughout her tenure, Jackie has worked to build partnerships that spur economic progress and positively impact Laughlin and southern Nevada. Under her steadfast and innovative leadership, her office created the first economic development plan in the city, supported the improvement of Needles Highway, and helped develop the Colorado River Greenway Heritage Park and Trails, among other accomplishments. Jackie's success is hard-fought and well-earned. She was born and raised in east Texas in a segregated community where she was not even allowed to use the local library. Instead, Jackie and her peers had to learn from textbooks that were outdated and out of circulation. Despite this, Jackie went on to receive her bachelor's degree from East Tennessee State University, and she later returned to Texas to attend the newly established Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where she graduated with a master's degree. In addition to her role as Laughlin town manager, Jackie has served as the county liaison to the town of Searchlight, NV, for more than 17 years. In 2014, Jackie was named a Distinguished Woman in Nevada, and in 2015, she was awarded Woman of the Year by the Real Life Church in Las Vegas. Jackie also sits on the Laughlin Chamber of Commerce board and has been involved with the Rotary Club, United Way Allocations Committee, Family Resource Center Board, and the former Laughlin Kiwanis Club. I congratulate Jackie on her many successes and decades of public service. I appreciate and commend her dedication to the Silver State, and I wish Jackie the best in her retirement and future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1313] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JACQUELYNE BRADY Mr. REID.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgS1314,CREC-2016-03-07,114,REMEMBERING NANCY REAGAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1314] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING NANCY REAGAN Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday the American people lost an icon. Nancy Davis Reagan died at the age of 94. Years ago, during an event at the White House, Nancy once serenaded her husband, singing: ``together we are going a long, long way.'' And boy did they ever. Born in New York and raised in Chicago, Nancy studied theater at Smith College in Massachusetts before moving westward to California to pursue a career in acting. She appeared in 11 motion pictures, but her life changed forever when her name appeared on the infamous list from the House Un-American Activities Committee. This was a list of people suspected of having ties to the Communist Party. Worried that she may be blacklisted, she demanded to meet with the president of the Screen Actors Guild in an effort to remove her name. And guess who was serving as president of the Screen Actors Guild-- Ronald Reagan. They met and fell in love. The rest is history. This month, 64 years ago, Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis married, and in Nancy's words: ``my life really began when I married my husband.'' And what a life it was. From the Governor's mansion in California to the White House, one thing was clear, Nancy was always on Ronald Reagan's mind. Straight out of a Hollywood script, their 52-year marriage was a true American love story. Their mutual love and devotion is a beautiful reminder of what a marriage should look like. We should all be so lucky. Fiercely loyal to her husband and America, you didn't want to get on the wrong side of Nancy Reagan. She had grit and was one tough lady when she had to be. Nancy was a passionate protector of her husband and the Presidency. And during talks with the Soviet Union, she constantly encouraged her husband to stay with it and not give up. She understood that nothing is more important than peace, and the historic START I arms reduction treaty may not have been possible had it not been for Nancy. After her husband's Presidency, she championed issues such as drug and alcohol abuse and afterschool programs. In 1994, after announcing his diagnosis with Alzheimer's, Ronald Reagan wrote: ``I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.'' But Nancy endured by working to stamp out Alzheimer's and tirelessly advocated for embryonic stem cell research for the rest of her life. She was determined to save other families from the pain she had gone through and she raised millions of dollars for research. She praised President Obama when he removed restrictions on the Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research and even teamed up with Ted Kennedy to work on these issues that were so close to her heart. Nancy had a special friendship with Ted Kennedy--who would call her every year on her birthday and sing an old Irish song to his dear friend. That type of bond between the two political parties is missing today in Washington. In an era when the political discourse can overwhelm the real problems we work to solve, Nancy Reagan's legacy can offer a path forward that we all can learn from. Before her death, Nancy reflected on the state of American politics and the inflammatory rhetoric we hear on the campaign trail, saying: ``Do you believe this? Do you believe this?'' Like many of us, she was disappointed by the lack of civility between the candidates. It certainly does not reflect a saying she made famous: ``Dignity should be at the center of everything we do.'' In honor of Nancy Reagan, I hope we all take that message to heart. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1314] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING NANCY REAGAN Mr. DURBIN.

Before her death, Nancy reflected on the state of American politics and the inflammatory rhetoric we hear on the campaign trail, saying: ``Do you believe this? Do you believe this?''

Mr. President, yesterday the American people lost an icon. Nancy Davis Reagan died at the age of 94. Years ago, during an event at the White House, Nancy once serenaded her husband, singing: ``together we are going a long, long way.'' And boy did they ever. Born in New York and raised in Chicago, Nancy studied theater at Smith College in Massachusetts before moving westward to California to pursue a career in acting. She appeared in 11 motion pictures, but her life changed forever when her name appeared on the infamous list from the House Un-American Activities Committee. This was a list of people suspected of having ties to the Communist Party. Worried that she may be blacklisted, she demanded to meet with the president of the Screen Actors Guild in an effort to remove her name. And guess who was serving as president of the Screen Actors Guild-- Ronald Reagan. They met and fell in love. The rest is history. This month, 64 years ago, Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis married, and in Nancy's words: ``my life really began when I married my husband.'' And what a life it was. From the Governor's mansion in California to the White House, one thing was clear, Nancy was always on Ronald Reagan's mind. Straight out of a Hollywood script, their 52-year marriage was a true American love story. Their mutual love and devotion is a beautiful reminder of what a marriage should look like. We should all be so lucky. Fiercely loyal to her husband and America, you didn't want to get on the wrong side of Nancy Reagan. She had grit and was one tough lady when she had to be. Nancy was a passionate protector of her husband and the Presidency. And during talks with the Soviet Union, she constantly encouraged her husband to stay with it and not give up. She understood that nothing is more important than peace, and the historic START I arms reduction treaty may not have been possible had it not been for Nancy. After her husband's Presidency, she championed issues such as drug and alcohol abuse and afterschool programs. In 1994, after announcing his diagnosis with Alzheimer's, Ronald Reagan wrote: ``I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.'' But Nancy endured by working to stamp out Alzheimer's and tirelessly advocated for embryonic stem cell research for the rest of her life. She was determined to save other families from the pain she had gone through and she raised millions of dollars for research. She praised President Obama when he removed restrictions on the Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research and even teamed up with Ted Kennedy to work on these issues that were so close to her heart. Nancy had a special friendship with Ted Kennedy--who would call her every year on her birthday and sing an old Irish song to his dear friend. That type of bond between the two political parties is missing today in Washington. In an era when the political discourse can overwhelm the real problems we work to solve, Nancy Reagan's legacy can offer a path forward that we all can learn from.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgS1313-3,CREC-2016-03-07,114,51ST ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1313-S1314] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 51ST ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today marks the 51st anniversary of what has come to be known as Bloody Sunday. On March 7, 1965, John Lewis and Reverend Hosea Williams led 600 brave civil rights activists in a march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. These courageous men, women, and children gathered to draw attention to the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans in Alabama and throughout much of the Deep South. They marched in pursuit of the most fundamental right, the right preservative of all others--the right to vote. What they received that day, however, were brutal beatings from police batons as State troopers turned them back and chased them down. More than 50 of the demonstrators were injured. John Lewis was beaten unconscious and nearly killed. Ten days later, Federal district court Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., granted protection to the activists, ruling that they were permitted to march from Selma to the State capitol in Montgomery. In the historic order he issued, Judge Johnson wrote: ``The law is clear that the right to petition one's government for the redress of grievances may be exercised in large groups. Indeed, where, as here, minorities have been harassed, coerced and intimidated, group association may be the only realistic way of exercising such rights. . . . These rights may be exercised by marching, even along public highways.'' Days later, the march proceeded with a crowd of approximately 3,200 marchers--which swelled to 25,000 by the time they reached the capitol. Within months, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law--guaranteeing that the right to vote would not be restricted through clever schemes, like poll taxes and literacy tests, devised to keep African Americans from voting. Last month, the foot soldiers of the 1965 voting rights marches were recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal. John Lewis, who since 1987 has been Congressman John Lewis, along with Reverend Frederick D. Reese, accepted the medal on behalf of the foot soldiers. At the ceremony, Congressman Lewis said: ``It was their determined marching feet that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. . . . They were just ordinary people with an extraordinary vision, to build a true democracy in America.'' In 2005, I was proud to join Congressman Lewis on a trip to Selma for a ceremonial walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 40th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. As we marched in recognition of that extraordinary vision to build a true democracy, we celebrated the marchers' achievement--a bill that has often been called the most significant civil rights law ever passed by Congress. Little did we know that, 8 years later, in 2013, the Supreme Court would strike down a major provision of that landmark legislation. In Shelby County v. Holder, on a 5-4 vote, a divided Supreme Court struck down the provision of the Voting Rights Act that required certain jurisdictions to preclear any changes to their voting laws with the Department of Justice. This decision effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act. Since the decision, States like Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi have put in place restrictive State voting laws--which all too often have a disproportionate impact on lower- income and minority voters. In order to truly honor the foot soldiers of Bloody Sunday and repair the damage done by Shelby County, Congress must restore the Voting Rights Act by passing the bipartisan Voting Rights Advancement Act. This bill, which Senator Leahy, Senator Coons, and I introduced last year, would ensure that the Federal Government is once again able to fully protect the fundamental right to vote. I wish that, 51 years after Bloody Sunday, America had reached a point where the protections of the Voting Rights Act were no longer necessary. But we have not, and the Voting Rights Act is still very much needed today. In 2006, Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act with an overwhelming bipartisan vote in both the House and the Senate. It is time to once again come together on a bipartisan basis and recognize the ongoing challenges that minority voters all too frequently face. Congress must take action to repair the Voting Rights Act and ensure the legacy of those who marched 51 years ago.

ADAM SMITH of washington in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Ryan Lafferty, a teacher in the Bellevue School District who has been recognized as a winner of the prestigious Milken Educator Award. The Milken Educator Awards are bestowed upon educators by the Milken Family Foundation to celebrate, elevate, and activate excellence in the teaching profession. The award is given to teachers who exhibit exceptional educational talent as evidenced by effective instructional practices and educational accomplishments beyond the classroom. Mr. Lafferty has been a teacher at the International School in Bellevue for six years and is highly praised for his interdisciplinary project-based teaching style, which incorporates seemingly unrelated subjects like math, history, and the arts. He has developed a problem- based curriculum for Advanced Placement Physics where students build Roman arches, projectile instruments such as slingshots and catapults, and a single-string instrument called a Diddley bow. Mr. Lafferty's classes are in high demand due to his track record of implementing creative lesson plans and for his infectious positive attitude. Mr. Lafferty is also beloved for the positive influence that he provides for his students. He makes himself available to students outside of class time if they need academic help, or if they need to talk for any other reason. He prioritizes the success of his students by regularly hosting meetings with students to determine what works in his class, and what can be improved. It is for these reasons that Mr. Lafferty is considered a role model by many of his students. Mr. Lafferty, who grew up in Redmond, graduated from the University of Washington in 2008 and received a Master's Degree in Teaching from Seattle University in 2010. He has worked with the Bellevue School District, the University of Washington and the George Lucas Educational Foundation to further develop his AP Physics curriculum in hopes of the program being implemented nationally. Lafferty is a National Honors Society advisor who serves on the school's middle and high school science clubs and travels to the state science bowl. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I congratulate teacher Ryan Lafferty for being honored with the Milken Educator Award. It is my great pleasure to recognize his dedication and service to his students and to the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E279] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING RYAN LAFFERTY FOR HIS RECOGNITION AS A MILKEN EDUCATOR AWARD WINNER ______ HON.

TOM MARINO of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to rare diseases as we recognize ``Rare Disease Week.'' A ``rare disease,'' also referred to as an orphan disease, is any disease that affects a small percentage of the population. The National Institute of Health defines a rare disease as one that affects less than 200,000 people in the United States. The impact of rare diseases is certainly not small; there are over 7,000 rare diseases that affect 30 million people, or 10% of the United States population. As the father of someone who suffers from Cystic Fibrosis, a rare disease affecting only 30,000 people in the United States, I know the difficulty of living with a rare disease and the financial burdens of care and treatment for families. Cystic Fibrosis requires specialized care that can cost upwards of $15,000 a year and hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime. I have done everything I can to make sure that my daughter receives the highest quality care as she continues her fight against Cystic Fibrosis. Thanks to advancements in medicine, the average life expectancy of someone who suffers from Cystic Fibrosis is now 37. This is much different than 50 years ago when a child diagnosed with the disease would be lucky to live to their teens. Every year we recognize rare disease week as a way to raise awareness and to stress the importance of funding rare disease research. It is my hope one day we can make rare, incurable diseases a thing of the past.

LARRY KIRKLAND FROM THE AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH ______ HON. KAREN BASS of california in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to make note of the retirement of The Right Reverend Theodore Larry Kirkland, Sr. from active service after over a half century of ministry, as he steps down at the African Methodist Episcopal Church Fifth District General Conference today. Bishop Kirkland's ministry of over 50 years has often placed him in the public eye and in the company of dignitaries. For example, he presided over the Homegoing Services of Deaconess Rosa Parks at Brown Chapel AME Church in Montgomery, Alabama, an event broadcast worldwide, and he welcomed then-Senator Barack Obama to the Ninth District's observance of Bloody Sunday, in Selma. He is the author of several books on church growth and he has become known for developing strong relationships across denominational and cultural lines. Educated at Alcorn State University, University of Mississippi, Claremont School of Theology, and California School of Theology, Bishop Kirkland was the founding pastor of Brookins Community AME Church in Los Angeles, California. Arriving in 1977, he grew the congregation from twelve early members to over eight thousand during his twenty-year tenure. Elevated in 1996, he became the 114th elected and consecrated bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. His first assignment was to the Seventeenth Episcopal District encompassing the countries of Zaire, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi and Zimbabwe. In 2000 he returned to appointment as Ecumenical Officer for the Denomination, served a term as President of the Council of Bishops, and from 2002 led the Ninth Episcopal District in Alabama, where he sought to support the community beyond the pulpit through a range of programs including computer literacy training and high-quality health services for the needy. For the past eight years, Bishop Kirkland has presided over the Fifth Episcopal District which includes fourteen western states. During this time, Bishop Kirkland has focused on inspiring ministry and serving the greater community. I would like to salute Bishop Kirkland and his family, especially his wife Mrs. Mary Kirkland, and thank him for his service to the faith and the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E280] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RETIREMENT OF BISHOP T.

KATHERINE M. CLARK of massachusetts in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, February 27 marked the 28th anniversary of harrowing violence against the Armenian community in Sumgait, Azerbaijan. I am proud to stand today with the Armenian-American community, including many of my constituents in Massachusetts, in remembrance and mourning of this unspeakable tragedy. In February of 1988, anti-Armenian rallies through Azerbaijan gave way to waves of ethnically-motivated violence, death and destruction. In the aftermath of these terrible events, Azerbaijan's Armenian community all but disappeared, with thousands displaced, culminating in a war against the people of Nagorno Karabakh. That war resulted in almost 30,000 dead on both sides. Hundreds of thousands of refugees were forced to flee their homes. And to this day, those who lost their lives or were displaced by this violence still seek resolution and justice. Many displaced Armenian families have sought refuge in America, and are now making vital contributions in the Fifth District of Massachusetts. Proudly, our diverse District is home to one of the largest Armenian communities in the nation. Together, our community is a thriving example of strength and perseverance in the face of extreme adversity. Like the persecution of too many others before it, the lessons of the Sumgait Pogrom must not be forgotten. We have a moral obligation to promote tolerance and justice, and we have a duty to recognize the atrocities that have kept us from our common goal. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E280] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 28TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY SUMGAIT, AZERBAIJAN ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Kirk Adams, President and CEO of the Lighthouse for the Blind, Inc., for his contributions and service to the blind community as he brings his leadership to his new role as President and CEO of the American Federation for the Blind. In 2008, Kirk became the first blind CEO and President of the Lighthouse for the Blind, an organization which provides independence and self-sufficiency through employment for people who are blind, deafblind, and blind with other disabilities. During his tenure as CEO, Kirk oversaw significant growth of the Lighthouse for the Blind's footprint across the country by expanding to eleven new locations. Each location added to the sustainability of the Lighthouse, while also empowering new groups of individuals to be gainfully employed. Prior to his executive role at the Lighthouse for the Blind, Kirk served as the General Manager of Administration and as the Director of Public Relations and Resource Development at the Lighthouse. Kirk is credited for crafting the Lighthouse's successful fundraising strategy, which has greatly magnified their range of services offered and the number of individuals who are lifted up through employment opportunities. Outside of his work at the Lighthouse for the Blind, Kirk is deeply involved in the community. He is a member of the Governor's Task Force on Disability and Employment and the Seattle Public Library's Strategic Plan Advisory Committee. He has served on the boards of the Aerospace Futures Alliance, the Association of Washington Business, and the American Federation for the Blind. He is also the former Treasurer and member of the Board of the National Association for the Employment of People Who Are Blind.

JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my good friend Patricia Bresee, a highly respected and recognized expert in juvenile law, who has served on the Board of Directors of the California Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for nine years as a remarkable leader with exceptional integrity and the capacity to inspire everyone around her. Pat Bresee's devotion to children is unmatched and she has dedicated her entire professional life to advocate for those in need. We are very fortunate that she will continue her advocacy for children in the dependency system through service on the Board of Directors for National CASA. Pat served as a Superior Court Commissioner in San Mateo County for 15 years. She was assigned to sit as a Juvenile Court Judge, handling dependency and delinquency issues and adoptions and guardianships. She was one of the original members of the California Judicial Council's Family and Juvenile Law Advisory Committee and served as the chair of the Juvenile Law Rules and Forms Committee. She teaches at the California Center for Judicial Education and trains attorneys and judicial officers in Juvenile Delinquency Law. She still manages to find time to be a regular presenter at Beyond the Bench and fills in as a judge at the Juvenile Court in San Mateo County. Her commitment to fight for justice is unwavering and she has freely volunteered her expertise and time to a number of organizations including the American Leadership Forum Silicon Valley, the Peninsula Community Foundation, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the San Mateo County First Five Commission, and most importantly, California CASA. I had the great honor and pleasure of working with Pat in her role at the San Mateo County Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Commission and the San Mateo County Blue Ribbon Commission on Children in Foster Care. Both commissions made recommendations on ways in which the courts could improve safety, permanency, well-being and fairness for children and families in our state. Pat's outstanding work has been proclaimed by the California Judges Association in 1994 when she was named Juvenile Court Judge of the Year and again in 1998 by National CASA as Judge of the Year. Judge Bresee graduated from Purdue University and earned her law degree from San Francisco Law School. She was admitted into the State Bar of California in 1972. When she is not fighting for justice, Pat likes to travel, attend the theater, read and lift weights. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the truly remarkable legal career of Patricia Bresee who continues to dedicate her life to advocate for children and thereby improves society as a whole. She is an outstanding example of a person with a moral compass who brings out the best in others. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E281] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF PATRICIA BRESEE ______ HON.

JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my good friend Patricia Bresee, a highly respected and recognized expert in juvenile law, who has served on the Board of Directors of the California Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for nine years as a remarkable leader with exceptional integrity and the capacity to inspire everyone around her. Pat Bresee's devotion to children is unmatched and she has dedicated her entire professional life to advocate for those in need. We are very fortunate that she will continue her advocacy for children in the dependency system through service on the Board of Directors for National CASA. Pat served as a Superior Court Commissioner in San Mateo County for 15 years. She was assigned to sit as a Juvenile Court Judge, handling dependency and delinquency issues and adoptions and guardianships. She was one of the original members of the California Judicial Council's Family and Juvenile Law Advisory Committee and served as the chair of the Juvenile Law Rules and Forms Committee. She teaches at the California Center for Judicial Education and trains attorneys and judicial officers in Juvenile Delinquency Law. She still manages to find time to be a regular presenter at Beyond the Bench and fills in as a judge at the Juvenile Court in San Mateo County. Her commitment to fight for justice is unwavering and she has freely volunteered her expertise and time to a number of organizations including the American Leadership Forum Silicon Valley, the Peninsula Community Foundation, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the San Mateo County First Five Commission, and most importantly, California CASA. I had the great honor and pleasure of working with Pat in her role at the San Mateo County Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Commission and the San Mateo County Blue Ribbon Commission on Children in Foster Care. Both commissions made recommendations on ways in which the courts could improve safety, permanency, well-being and fairness for children and families in our state. Pat's outstanding work has been proclaimed by the California Judges Association in 1994 when she was named Juvenile Court Judge of the Year and again in 1998 by National CASA as Judge of the Year. Judge Bresee graduated from Purdue University and earned her law degree from San Francisco Law School. She was admitted into the State Bar of California in 1972. When she is not fighting for justice, Pat likes to travel, attend the theater, read and lift weights. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the truly remarkable legal career of Patricia Bresee who continues to dedicate her life to advocate for children and thereby improves society as a whole.

CHARLES W. DENT of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to bring the 50th Anniversary of DeSales University to the attention of the House. Named in honor of Saint Francis de Sales, DeSales was founded after Bishop Joseph McShea organized a survey of Catholic education opportunities in the Allentown Diocese. The study indicated there was a need for a Catholic College in the Lehigh Valley area of the Allentown Diocese. The Oblates of St. Francis de Sales broke ground for the new college in May of 1964 on a 500 acre tract located in Lehigh County's Upper Saucon Township. DeSales accepted its first class of freshmen in September 1965 under its original name--Allentown College of St. Francis de Sales. The ensuing decades brought growth--both in the number of students enrolled and in the curriculum offered. In March 2000, Allentown College proudly became DeSales University. Currently, DeSales has a total enrollment of over 3,000 traditional, graduate and evening students and nearly 1,600 full-time undergraduate students. The school offers 41 majors and 31 minors and boasts over 100 faculty members. DeSales plays an integral role in the Lehigh Valley's educational network and within the community. DeSales' graduates have enjoyed tremendous success across the fields of business, medicine, philosophy, literature, science and teaching. It is my pleasure to congratulate the students, alumni, faculty and staff of DeSales University as they celebrate their 50th Anniversary. It is my hope that a future member of this House will be able to enter a congratulatory record on their behalf fifty years from now as well. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E282] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DeSALES UNIVERSITY ______ HON.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgE282-3,CREC-2016-03-07,114,THE GROWING THREAT OF CHOLERA AND OTHER DISEASES IN THE MIDDLE EAST,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E282-E283] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE GROWING THREAT OF CHOLERA AND OTHER DISEASES IN THE MIDDLE EAST ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, during the last several years, conflicts in the Middle East have cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, primarily in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. As a result of conflicts in these countries, as well as the influx of refugees from conflict zones into surrounding countries such as Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, many of those who die are the victim of disease. Almost 17 million people in the region are in need of humanitarian assistance, including roughly four million refugees who have fled their countries and an additional 13 million people who have left their homes but are internally displaced within their countries. A hearing I convened last week examined the scope of the cholera and other disease threats to determine what can and should be done to control it and minimize their spread beyond the Middle East. The World Health Organization reported the spread of a cholera epidemic that first began in Iraq in 2007 that crossed over into Iran, Syria and is considered the region's greatest, although not only, health threat. These threats are worsened by the targeting of health workers in Syria and an Islamic State that has no experience and little interest in providing social services. Thus, cholera and other diseases are untreated, often unreported and pose a significant health threat in the region due to poor sanitation and overcrowding in areas such as refugee camps. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease that can cause death within hours if left untreated. Roughly 80% of those who contract the disease do not develop symptoms, leaving some uncertainty about precisely how many people contract the disease annually. Scientists estimate that between 1.4 and 4.3 million people contract cholera annually, of whom 28,000 to 142,000 die. Cholera bacteria are present in the feces of infected people for one to ten days after infection and can be spread to others if they ingest food or water that is contaminated with their fecal matter. The spread of cholera is mostly facilitated by inadequate water and sanitation management and outbreaks are common in areas where basic infrastructure is unavailable, such as urban slums and camps for internally displaced persons and refugees. As devastating as this cholera epidemic has been and can be going forward, we must also remember the MERS epidemic of three years ago. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is a respiratory illness. It is caused by a virus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, or MERS-CoV. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. It is different from any other coronaviruses that have been found in people before. MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, is thought to spread from an infected person's respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. However, the precise ways the virus spreads are not currently well understood. MERS-CoV has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. Infected people have spread MERS-CoV to others even in healthcare settings, such as hospitals. This transmission pattern is more likely when medical facilities and health workers are in short supply. The conflicts and political crises in the Middle East have brought anguish, suffering, and severe declines in health to people throughout the region. The most catastrophic case by far is Syria, where more than a million people have experienced traumatic injuries, once-rare infectious diseases have returned, chronic disease goes untreated, and the health system has collapsed. In Yemen, Libya, Gaza, and Iraq violence has limited access to health care and grievously harmed the population. According to Physicians for Human Rights last summer, at least 633 medical personnel had been killed and more than 270 illegal attacks on 202 separate medical facilities had taken place since March 2011 in Syria. Of the attacks on medical facilities, at least 51, or 19 percent, reportedly were carried out with barrel bombs. Almost all the assaults were inflicted by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. In the Middle East, threats against as well as arrests and intimidation of health workers extends beyond armed conflict to situations of political volatility, as evident in Bahrain, Egypt, and Turkey. In most of these cases, doctors and nurses who treat victims of violence are, by the very act of providing treatment, deemed guilty of anti-government activities. In Bahrain, almost 100 doctors and nurses were arrested and 48 originally charged with felonies for having offered medical care to wounded people in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, Cholera can be treated and its spread can be prevented, but diseases such as MERS pose a danger of spreading beyond the region. However, beyond the global health implications, we must consider the compounded suffering of people in the Middle East. Not only are they often in threat of violence through no fault of their own but they face preventable, treatable diseases that have gotten out of control due to conflicts. Our panel at the hearing included health experts who helped us think through the health challenges our government faces in considering how to provide the most effective assistance to people in the Middle East. The two keys to success are: remain vigilant and sustain commitment. The hearing last week was intended to demonstrate our vigilance and commitment to addressing this situation.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgE283-2,CREC-2016-03-07,114,HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LOUISIANA STATE REP. RONNIE EDWARDS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E283] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LOUISIANA STATE REP. RONNIE EDWARDS ______ HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND of louisiana in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Louisiana State Representative Ronnie Edwards, a dear friend and model public servant. Rep. Edwards passed away on February 24, 2016, at the age of 63 after a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer. Rep. Edwards was born in Woodville, Mississippi on July 20, 1952, and was a long time resident of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. An administrator with over 40 years of experience in government and industry, Rep. Edwards formed lasting relationships and partnerships with education institutions, nonprofits, faith leaders and elected officials to effect change through her community development work. In 1992, Rep. Edwards founded the Urban Restoration Enhancement Corporation (UREC) as a trusted and credible community development organization. With the assistance of many community leaders and supporters, her tenacity resulted in: safe and affordable housing for families; the establishment of Louisiana's first home for grandparents raising grandchildren in Baton Rouge; innovative youth enrichment initiatives; small business training and development; and the development of the Security Dads initiative to combat violence. Rep. Edwards was elected to represent District 5 on the Baton Rouge Metro Council in 2009. She served on the Council for six years before being elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in November 2015. In December 2013, Rep. Edwards was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. But for the first year and a half, she did not stop her work at the local level and maintained perfect attendance at Metro Council meetings, where she was a strong advocate of health living initiatives, cancer screenings and affordable housing. Rep. Edwards' diagnosis and experience in the health care system was motivation for her to run for State Representative because she wanted to be an advocate for ways to bring health care access to more citizens. Ronnie was a talented and compassionate legislator, but more importantly she was a friend. The news of her passing is not only devastating to me, it is a tremendous loss for the entire state. She committed her life to serving her constituents and fighting for those who needed it the most. As we mourn her loss we must honor her legacy by renewing our commitment to the work she fought so hard to complete. Louisiana has lost a lion, but her memory will live on forever. Mr. Speaker, my deepest condolences are with her family as they go through this difficult time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E283] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LOUISIANA STATE REP.

KATHLEEN M. RICE of new york in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary life of Helias Doundoulakis, who passed away on February 29th, 2016 at the age of 92. A long-time resident of New York's fourth congressional district, Mr. Doundoulakis was a decorated veteran of World War II and an accomplished civil engineer who played a critical role in developing some of the greatest aeronautic achievements of the 20th century. Born in Ohio and raised in Crete, Greece, Mr. Doundoulakis was still in high school when Axis forces invaded Crete in 1941. Nevertheless, he joined the Cretan resistance and worked alongside the British Special Operations Executive, collecting vital intelligence for allied forces and sabotaging Axis military operations across the Mediterranean. When it became too dangerous for Mr. Doundoulakis to remain in Crete, he and his brother fled to Egypt, where they immediately rejoined the fight and enlisted in the United States Office of Strategic Services. Despite overwhelming danger, Mr. Doundoulakis' commitment to liberating Crete and defeating the Axis powers never wavered. After the war, Doundoulakis returned to the United States and settled in New York, where as a civil engineer for Grumman Aerospace Corporation, he helped develop several groundbreaking aeronautic innovations, including the Apollo Lunar Module, the Space Shuttle and the F-14 Tomcat fighter jet. One of Mr. Doundoulakis' most notable achievements was his patent for a radio telescope, used in the design for the largest of its kind at the NAIC Arecibo Observatory, in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, which is the world's largest single-aperture telescope and has played a crucial role in atmospheric and astronomical research. Mr. Doundoulakis served his country both as a courageous soldier and a bold innovator who helped propel the United States to the forefront of aviation and space exploration. While those who knew Mr. Doundoulakis mourn his passing, we also celebrate his incredible life and all that he achieved. It was truly an honor to serve as Mr. Doundoulakis' representative in Congress and I extend my sincere condolences to his wife Rita Doundoulakis, his children, grandchildren and to all those whose lives he touched. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E283] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING WORLD WAR II VETERAN & CIVIL ENGINEER HELIAS DOUNDOULAKIS ______ HON.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgE284,CREC-2016-03-07,114,INTRODUCTION OF THE GENDER DIVERSITY IN CORPORATE LEADERSHIP ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E284] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE GENDER DIVERSITY IN CORPORATE LEADERSHIP ACT ______ HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of new york in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to introduce the Gender Diversity in Corporate Leadership Act, common- sense legislation to address the striking gender disparity in America's corporate boardrooms. A recent GAO report found that women hold only about 16 percent of board seats at S&P 1500 companies, up from 8 percent in 1997. While this is progress, even if women comprise half of new board members from this point forward, the report estimated it would take over 40 years to reach gender parity. My legislation would take a few simple steps to collect data to better define this disparity and encourage businesses to take steps to diversify their boards. By requiring publicly-traded companies to report the gender composition of their boards, we will make it easy for investors and other organizations to evaluate board diversity. The evidence is clear, companies with diverse leadership are better- positioned to succeed. Indeed, a recent report published by MSCI found that companies with ``strong female leadership'' (either above-average board representation or a female CEO and at least one female board member) generated a higher return on equity and valuation than companies lacking female leadership. That finding follows a 2014 Credit Suisse report that found companies with at least one woman on their board outperformed other companies by 5 percent from the start of 2012- June 2014. I am proud that the Gender Diversity in Corporate Leadership Act is supported by a strong coalition of business leaders like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as leading voices to promote workplace diversity like Catalyst and the National Women's Law Center. I want to commend these groups for their work on these issues, as well as my original co-sponsors Reps. Don Beyer and Debbie Dingell for their partnership on this important legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E284] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE GENDER DIVERSITY IN CORPORATE LEADERSHIP ACT ______ HON.

Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation's women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Dolores Diaz- Carey, of Pasadena, California. Born in Los Angeles, Dolores attended Sacred Heart Elementary School and Sacred Heart High School. She received her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Spanish Literature from Holy Names University and her Master's Degree in Education from the University of Southern California. In addition, Dolores obtained a Counseling Credential from the University of California, Los Angeles and an Administrative Credential from California State University, Los Angeles. A consummate educator, Ms. Diaz-Carey's long career in education began as a teacher at the elementary and junior high school levels in Northern California, after which she moved to Mexico City to teach. In 1969, Dolores joined the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) where she worked for 35 years. In LAUSD's Division of Adult and Career Education, she worked in many capacities, including as an ESL (English as a Second Language) instructor, teacher advisor, counselor, assistant principal, and principal. From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Diaz-Carey was Executive Producer of the first bilingual ESL television series for adults, ``POCHTLAN'', for which she was awarded an Emmy from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. From 1987 to 1998, she was Principal of Garfield Community Adult School and while there, founded a family literacy program for adults and their children. In 1998, Dolores became Director of the Adult Instructional Services Unit where she was responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of all the curricula for adults, including ESL, high school diploma, basic education, parenting, and nursing programs--during this time, she was also Program Director of the Community Based English Tutoring program. Dolores is a longtime member of the East Los Angeles Rotary Club, where she serves as the Rotarian advisor for a youth club, and is the incoming club president. In 2011, she received the Rotarian Foundation District Service Award.

KAREN BASS of california in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the 90th birthday of my friend and mentor, Charles Edward DuBois. Charlie was born to Vernon and Edna DuBois in New Jersey on February 26, 1926 and raised with his three siblings during the Depression by his loving parents. [[Page E285]] Young Charlie showed a fighting spirit from early in life, and learned his values at his father's knee, including when W.E.B. DuBois (no relation) would stop by his home to argue and discuss issues of race and justice. Now four generations of the DuBois family have dedicated themselves to lifting up working people. Charlie enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1944 and served honorably in the Pacific theatre. After returning from the war, Charlie often provided security services for those speaking out and demanding social change, including Paul Robeson, Hortensia Bussi and Angela Davis. Charlie moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s, where he met and married his wife, Viki. They both worked at Kaiser Permanente for years. He and Viki were blessed with two sons. Charlie and Viki were organizers and leaders of Black Women United (which evolved into Black Women and Men during the 1970s). Through these organizations, they fought (among other things) for criminal justice reform. These groups also worked to support those who were incarcerated, helping their families during the time they were in prison, and working to aid their adjustment when they returned to the community. Charlie often mentored youth in the justice movement, and he was instrumental in my own decision to pursue medical training as an effective way of seeking change and providing service to others. I would like to salute Charles Edward DuBois for his longstanding commitment to serving others and for remaining true to his principles throughout his long life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E284-E285] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF CHARLES EDWARD DuBOIS ______ HON.

A community activist while running her practice in Silver Lake, after thirty-three years, Cheryl retired and devoted all of her time and talents to helping her community.

She was the Founder and President of the Silver Lake Chamber of Commerce, where she was active for more than two decades, and now acts as a consultant to the chamber. Currently, Cheryl serves as Co- Chair of the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council History Collective Committee, a position she has held for over a decade, is a board member of the Friends of the Silver Lake Library, and volunteers with CollegePath LA at John Marshall High School. In addition, Dr. Revkin is on the Los Angeles City Disability Access Review Board Commission, helps out in the Los Angeles Neighborhood Justice Program and the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, and serves on the Board of Automata, a puppet theatre in Los Angeles.

CREC-2016-03-07-pt1-PgE285-2,CREC-2016-03-07,114,CHRONICLING THE PRESIDENT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 36 (Monday, March 7, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E285-E287] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHRONICLING THE PRESIDENT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTIONS ______ HON. KEITH J. ROTHFUS of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, when our Founders wrote the Constitution, they had the wisdom to create a system of checks and balances among the three branches of government. They knew this would limit power, protect against abuses, and promote liberty under the Constitution. The President has the right to nominate justices to the Supreme Court, but the Senate has the co-equal right to consent to such an appointment. One branch has a power; another has a check. Today, with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, we have a chance to see this system of checks and balances in action. In deciding to exercise its consent to an appointment to the Supreme Court, the Senate should assess whether the President has been acting consistent with the Constitution. The chart below highlights just a few of the President's unconstitutional actions since he was reelected in 2012. July 2013: President disregards employer mandate. February 2014: President disregards employer mandate again. June 2014: SCOTUS rules 9-0 President violated Appointments Clause. November 2014: President announces executive amnesty. May 2015: Court of Appeals stops executive amnesty. February 2016: Stops Clean Power Plan. These actions have been frequent, repeated, and grave. These actions have poisoned the well of deliberation for this appointment. In that light, why shouldn't the Senate withhold consent? It is a game the President chose to play, and now he must face the consequence. SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference. This title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate Daily Digest--designated by the Rules Committee--of the time, place and purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or changes in the meetings as they occur. As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this information, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the Congressional Record on Monday and Wednesday of each week. Meetings scheduled for Tuesday, March 8, 2016 may be found in the Daily Digest of today's Record. MEETINGS SCHEDULED MARCH 9 9:30 a.m. Committee on Environment and Public Works To hold hearings to examine cooperative federalism, focusing on state perspectives on Environmental Protection Agency regulatory actions and the role of states as co-regulators.

KEITH J. ROTHFUS of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, when our Founders wrote the Constitution, they had the wisdom to create a system of checks and balances among the three branches of government. They knew this would limit power, protect against abuses, and promote liberty under the Constitution. The President has the right to nominate justices to the Supreme Court, but the Senate has the co-equal right to consent to such an appointment. One branch has a power; another has a check. Today, with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, we have a chance to see this system of checks and balances in action. In deciding to exercise its consent to an appointment to the Supreme Court, the Senate should assess whether the President has been acting consistent with the Constitution. The chart below highlights just a few of the President's unconstitutional actions since he was reelected in 2012. July 2013: President disregards employer mandate. February 2014: President disregards employer mandate again. June 2014: SCOTUS rules 9-0 President violated Appointments Clause. November 2014: President announces executive amnesty. May 2015: Court of Appeals stops executive amnesty. February 2016: Stops Clean Power Plan. These actions have been frequent, repeated, and grave. These actions have poisoned the well of deliberation for this appointment. In that light, why shouldn't the Senate withhold consent? It is a game the President chose to play, and now he must face the consequence. SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference. This title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate Daily Digest--designated by the Rules Committee--of the time, place and purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or changes in the meetings as they occur. As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this information, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the Congressional Record on Monday and Wednesday of each week.
