Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Nick Castle was a bright, energetic 23-year-old who decided to teach in China, following his graduation from UC Berkeley. Tragically, Nick became seriously sick after becoming a Peace Corps volunteer in China in 2012. He was the victim of an inefficient, under- equipped, and unresponsive Peace Corps-led medical team there. After being prescribed a broad antibiotic, Nick began to experience drastic weight loss, but was told he was fine. He was then confined to bed, but his doctor never recommended he go to the hospital. After experiencing dangerously low blood pressure, Nick was finally sent to the hospital. As the ambulance made its way to him, it got lost. Then, after picking him up, Nick stopped breathing before the ambulance arrived at the hospital. Nick died a few weeks later, in early 2013. Investigations revealed the Peace Corps medical team misdiagnosed his illness. This heartbreaking death of a young man serving our country and the world could have been avoided had the Peace Corps staff assisted in having a properly trained, equipped, and responsive team. Mr. Speaker, Peace Corps volunteers are America's angels abroad. They are some of the best that we have. They are the spirit of humanitarian assistance, and America must make sure to take care of these amazing people when they serve in lands far, far away so that there are no more deaths like Nick Castle's.

Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the ongoing crisis in my hometown of Flint, Michigan, is a real tragedy. This failure of government has affected 100,000 people--adults and children--who, after months and months, still do not have clean drinking water. It is my view that the State of Michigan bears the principal responsibility for this crisis and should step up and do more. It was the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality that failed to a great extent. I know there are Members who share my view that there is responsibility at every level of government.

The Latin Express Band, founded by Carlos and Leo Saenz, comes a long way from their humble roots of playing high school dances. Over the past 40 years, they have played in music venues throughout the Dallas- Forth Worth metroplex and the country. In 2001, they were one of the music groups invited to perform at the Presidential Inaugural Ball. They were recently inducted into the Tejano R.O.O.T.S. Hall of Fame in 2008. Along with their musical accolades, the Latin Express Band has inspired future generations of local musicians through their support of music education for children, youth, and adults. On March 31st, the Saenz brothers will perform at Forth Worth's historic Casa Manana Theatre in honor of Cesar Chavez' birthday. Carlos and Leo have come a long way from their days playing at Sadie Hawkins dances back in the day, and I am honored to recognize their achievements.

Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this week regarding the Second Amendment. By overturning the decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, the Court has reaffirmed not only that Americans have the right to self- defense, but also that stun guns are covered under the Second Amendment. The case began when a woman named Jaime Caetano was continually threatened by an abusive ex-boyfriend who, at one point, put her in the hospital. At the urging of a friend, she began carrying a stun gun for protection. After an incident that a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend failed to prevent, the threat of a nonlethal device prevented any harm of Ms. Caetano. Yet, Massachusetts had previously outlawed the ownership of stun guns, and she was arrested. Massachusetts' highest court sided against the Supreme Court's Heller decision, which set clear standards for the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court Justices clearly saw the foolishness in the State court's decision and reversed it this week, reasserting that the right to bear arms ``extends to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence'' when our Nation was founded. This is a reminder that the rights of all Americans must be defended vigilantly by every generation. I commend the Supreme Court for its decision and Justice Alito for his concurring opinion that gives individuals in all States a necessary nonlethal option for protection against violence. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [House] [Page H1556] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS (Mr. GIBBS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Mr. Speaker, on Monday, March 21; Tuesday, March 22; and Wednesday, March 23, 2016, I was on medical leave while recovering from hip replacement surgery and unable to be present for recorded votes. Had I been present, I would have voted: ``Yes'' on rollcall vote No. 130 (on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4314, as amended). ``No'' on rollcall vote No. 131 (on ordering the previous question on H. Res. 653). ``No'' on rollcall vote No. 132 (on agreeing to the resolution H. Res. 653). ``Yes'' on rollcall vote No. 133 (on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4742). ``Yes'' on rollcal1 vote No. 134 (on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4755). ``Yes'' on rollcall vote No. 135 (on the motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4336, as amended). ``Yes'' on rollcall vote No. 136 (on the motion to recommit H.R. 2745, with instructions). ``No'' on rollcall vote No. 137 (on passage of H.R. 2745). ``Yes'' on rollcall vote No. 138 (on agreeing to the resolution on H. Res. 658). Personal Explanation Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, due to an illness I was unable to vote on the following: Rollcall No. 130. Rollcall No. 131. Rollcall No. 132. Rollcall No. 133. Rollcall No. 134. Rollcall No. 135. Rollcall No. 137. Rollcall No. 138. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes.'' On rollcall No. 136, had I been present, I would have voted ``no.'' personal explanation Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, had I been present for the vote on the Democratic Motion to Recommit H.R. 2745, which would add protections for consumers by ensuring that the underlying bill would not apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs (rollcall No. 136), I would have voted ``aye.'' Had I been present for the vote on the passage of H.R. 2745, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act (rollcall No. 137), I would have voted ``nay.'' This bill would eliminate important administrative and procedural tools the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) uses to protect market competition and the American consumer. Additionally, this bill seems unnecessary, particularly after the Wall Street Journal dubbed 2015 the ``biggest year ever for mergers and acquisitions.'' Additionally, had I been present for the vote on H. Res. 658, a resolution condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Brussels on March 22, 2016, (rollcall No. 138), I would have voted ``aye.'' These attacks signal a painful continuation in our struggle against terrorism. ____________________",package_114_292.csv,7667,7667,7737,"[congressional record volume 162, number 46 (wednesday, march

CREC-2016-03-23-pt1-PgH1557-3,CREC-2016-03-23,114,CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1557-H1560] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 658) condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Brussels on March 22, 2016, which murdered more than 30 innocent people, and severely wounded many more. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 658 Whereas, on March 22, 2016, at least three Islamist terrorists conducted coordinated attacks against two sites in Brussels, Belgium, resulting in the loss of more than 30 innocent lives and the severe wounding of many more innocent civilians; Whereas a number of American citizens are among those wounded; Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for the attacks; Whereas the brutal attacks at the Brussels airport and the Maelbeek metro station are the latest in a series of assaults by ISIS in Europe, including the November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, France, that were deliberately aimed at killing and maiming as many innocent people as possible; Whereas Belgian first responders and law enforcement reacted swiftly and heroically, caring for the wounded and taking immediate measures to prevent additional attacks and the further loss of life; Whereas at least two of the terrorists were killed in the suicide bombings, and Belgian intelligence and law enforcement are pursuing others possibly connected to these attacks and to those in Paris; Whereas Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called the attacks ``a black moment'' for the country and urged his fellow citizens to stay united in their response; Whereas Belgium and its capital Brussels are the symbolic center of the alliance between the United States and Europe that was created following the devastation of World War II, including by hosting on its territory the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the institutions of the European Union; Whereas Belgium and the United States have maintained strong ties based on shared values since Belgium's independence in 1831; Whereas Belgium was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and has been a steadfast ally of the United States in the decades since; Whereas, on September 12, 2001, for the first time in the history of the Alliance, Belgium joined our NATO allies to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty that states ``an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all''; Whereas Belgium has been a steadfast partner of the United States in the international effort to defeat ISIS and other terrorist threats; Whereas the coordination of these attacks, following the terrorist assaults in Paris and in several other countries, demonstrates that ISIS members continue to plan and execute attacks, targeting United States interests and allies; Whereas continued and enhanced intelligence cooperation, law enforcement engagement, and information sharing on emerging threats and identified Islamist extremists is essential to enhancing security for the people of the United States, Europe, and our allies around the world; Whereas the loss of innocent lives in Brussels strengthens our resolve to defeat ISIS and its terrorist affiliates which pose a growing threat to international peace and stability; and Whereas we stand in solidarity with our Belgian allies in their time of national mourning, ready to provide assistance in bringing to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these attacks, as well as identifying and disrupting any plans to undertake similar assaults in the future: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Brussels on March 22, 2016, which murdered more than 30 innocent people, and severely wounded many more; (2) expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences for those killed and injured in the attacks and for their families and friends; (3) pledges support for the Government of Belgium in its efforts to bring to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these terrorist attacks; (4) declares that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) poses a fundamental threat to the universal value of freedom in all countries; (5) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East and West and North Africa and the threat posed by these individuals; and (6) expresses its readiness to assist the Government and people of Belgium to respond to the threat posed by ISIS and its terrorist affiliates. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. {time} 0915 General Leave Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 658, condemning the series of terrorist attacks in Belgium carried out by Islamic extremists yesterday. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution, condemning the terrorist attacks in Brussels carried out by Islamist extremists yesterday. ISIS terrorists have once again struck in Europe, and this time in Belgium. The murderers coldly chose crowded areas at the Brussels Airport and at the metro system in order to kill and maim as many innocent men, women, and children as possible. And the latest numbers are 31 dead and 270 wounded, including a number of Americans. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, the latest in a series that includes an horrific attack in Brussels, the attack in Paris, a double suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, and the boast of responsibility for downing a Russian passenger jet in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The list of atrocities is far [[Page H1558]] longer, including those by ISIS affiliates elsewhere, such as the recent attack in Ivory Coast. As these and other assaults show, ISIS is rapidly expanding its reach beyond its bases in Syria and in Iraq. Over 30,000 fighters from more than 100 countries have joined ISIS, including more than 250 Americans. We had a young Yazidi girl tell us that she was taken as a concubine by one of these Americans who had been recruited 4 years ago on the Internet by ISIS. More than 4,500 of this terrorist diaspora hold Western passports and are but a plane ride away, a plane ride away from the United States and from Europe. This resolution puts the House on record as condemning the attacks in Brussels and extends our sympathies to those affected by this tragedy, and it reaffirms our support for the people of Belgium in their time of national anguish. But we must do more than just express our sorrow. We must take decisive action to eliminate the threat, including expanding information-sharing with our friends and allies, putting stronger border checks in place, combating the online propaganda and hate speech of ISIS extremists, and sharpening coalition efforts to destroy ISIS itself. I will remind the Members that our committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, has held a series of hearings on this. When ISIS came out of Raqqa in the first place and headed towards the border and headed towards Fallujah, that was the time to hit this so-called JV team. This group of guys in pickup trucks, as the President called them at the time, were an open target on the open desert as they headed to Fallujah and, after that, as they headed to city after city after city without us using our airpower to hit them early on. They finally took Mosul and, with it, they took the Central Bank of Iraq. At this point, they have to be destroyed, and it is going to take a strategic plan to make certain the United States leads in that effort. We need to get it done. Mr. KEATING. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 658, a resolution condemning yesterday's tragic attack in Brussels, Belgium. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Texas, Judge Ted Poe, chairman of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, on which I serve as the ranking member, in expressing my deepest condolences to the victims, families, and loved ones of those affected by yesterday's brutal attacks. The resolution before us today strongly condemns the terrorist attacks perpetrated in Brussels yesterday and expresses the sympathy of the House of Representatives for the people of Belgium. With the strength of the U.S. intelligence community, we pledge our support for the Belgian Government in its efforts to investigate and to bring to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these deadly plans. Belgium remains one of our strongest allies, a nation with which we have worked closely in bilateral and multilateral arenas. Belgium was on our side as an active participant in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, as a leader in the European Union mission in Mali, and as an ally in the 2010-2011 NATO operations in Libya. As host of the European Union and NATO headquarters, Belgium-- Brussels, in particular--represents both a symbolic and a concrete role in promoting transatlantic cooperation between our two countries and our allies. It is not by accident that the Maelbeek metro station and the Brussels Airport were selected as the site for such heinous violence. Nearby, a mere stone's throw from the Maelbeek station, sits the headquarters of the European Union and numerous government offices, including the U.S. Embassy, which is less than a mile away. Daily, hundreds, if not thousands of civil servants and public interest sector workers cross through the station on the way back and forth to work. And at Brussels Airport, dozens of innocent travelers and family members were drawn into a bloodshed that has spread from Iraq and Syria to the surrounding region and beyond. I visited both while in Europe last year on a security codel, and I saw, firsthand, the strong police presence providing a sense of security for Brussels residents and visitors. Due to the bravery, courage, and preparedness of Belgian law enforcement authorities and emergency response teams, many families were spared the pain of losing a loved one. And we honor, today, their quick action and their bravery. These terrorist attacks are misguided attempts to divide the global coalition that has come together to degrade and defeat ISIS and their affiliates. From Ankara, to Istanbul, to Beirut, to Baga, we recognize that the prominent sentiment across the Middle East identifies ISIS rhetoric and actions as contrary to the tolerance and teachings of Islam. While this remains an open investigation, the nature of yesterday's attacks hit close to home. Whether it is New York City, San Bernardino, or whether it is Boston--where I saw, firsthand, the resilience in spirit come forward that any physical attack can never conquer--we see that same spirit and resolve in the people of Brussels and Belgium today. The flow of foreign fighters, the traveling that they do, and the extenuating threat that they pose have been our top security-related concerns here in Congress. Congress and the administration have taken actions to address these issues and prevent the risk of such an attack here at home. We have tightened security restrictions for travelers from visa waiver countries who are known to have traveled to Iraq and Syria. We have sealed intelligence-sharing gaps between Federal, State, and local law enforcement, as well as our international partners in the intelligence community. And we are in the process of an unprecedented top-to-bottom review of airport security threats that will ensure our airports are safer than ever. The international community, including governments and prominent organizations throughout the Middle East and Muslim-majority nations, have spoken out against these heinous attacks. With passage of this resolution, the U.S. Congress joins these communities around the world in its condemnation of the terrorist attacks yesterday in Brussels. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) for his comments, for his support of this legislation, and also for the privilege to work with him on our Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, where we have had numerous hearings on the issue of ISIS and other terrorist groups that are lurking throughout the United States and the world. Mr. Speaker, the attacks began shortly before 8 a.m., with an explosion at a departure terminal at the Brussels Airport. The area was between two American airlines--American Airlines and Delta Air Lines-- American companies. It was believed to be a luggage bomb, followed by another bomb shortly thereafter. Then, at 9:11 a.m., Brussels time, a bomb tore through the last car of a subway train as it was pulling out of a station in central Brussels. Belgian officials have said that the bombings killed at least 10 at the airport and at least 20 at the subway station. More than 230 others were wounded. Details are still surfacing, but we now know that at least 10 Americans were wounded in the attacks. One of those was a member of the United States Air Force. Later in the afternoon, a news agency affiliated with ISIS issued a report bragging and claiming responsibility for the murders. Reports said that the attacks were in retaliation for Belgium's participation in a coalition against ISIS. Mr. Speaker, ISIS, this group that is relatively new in the terrorist industry, has already committed 70 terrorist attacks worldwide in 20 countries, as of January 1 of this year, and yet this is one more. These attacks in Belgium occurred just 4 days after the capture of one of Europe's most wanted terrorists, [[Page H1559]] Salah Abdeslam, the sole survivor of the 10 men who carried out the November horrific attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. The attacks in Belgium made it clear to all that ISIS still maintains operational networks in Europe, capable of carrying out attacks abroad, even as security services are on highest alert. The bombing in downtown Brussels occurred just steps away from major institutions, as the ranking member, Mr. Keating, has pointed out. Brussels is the capital of Belgium. It is the headquarters of the European Union. It is the headquarters of NATO. This bombing attack occurred near the U.S. Embassy that is there. This area, Brussels, Belgium, stands and represents, really, the free world's endeavor to work together under democracy and liberty and those ideals that we value. It was no accident that Brussels was picked for the attack. The fact that ISIS could operate cells in Europe and manage to strike at the heart of European society only a few months after the Paris attacks should make us cognizant that our current strategy against ISIS is really not successful. ISIS has been able to hold on to territory for close to 2 years. It is from this territory in Iraq and Syria that it trains its fighters, recruits foreigners, and plans to launch attacks against not only Europe, but other countries, like the United States. Words claiming progress and success against ISIS are meaningless when confronted with devastating carnage like what we saw in the United States, in San Bernardino, and what occurred in Paris and now in Brussels. The United States must change its strategy against ISIS. We must allow ISIS no safe haven anywhere in the world. We must take away their capabilities to strike American cities. This resolution shows that the people of the United States stand alongside our European and Belgian allies in solidarity. The American people extend their deepest sympathies to those affected by the tragedy. Let the people of Belgium know that the United States will support them through this time in every way possible, and we must be more united in the face of this terrorist onslaught that threatens the very freedoms that we hold dear. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my colleague and fellow New Englander. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank both the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Texas for their extraordinary leadership on this important resolution. Yesterday, the world saw the face of evil in a series of cowardly and despicable terrorist acts that claimed the lives of 34 innocent people in Brussels. I, too, extend my thoughts and prayers to all of the families affected by this horrific violence. At the same time, Mr. Speaker, here in Congress, we must renew our commitment to keep Americans safe from terrorism, continue to support our intelligence services and law enforcement agencies in their critical work, and do all that is necessary to defeat and destroy these terrorists wherever they are. {time} 0930 Today the United States and the entire world are standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Belgium. The ISIS terrorists who perpetrated these attacks did so in an attempt to strike fear into the heart of anyone who does not share their radical world views. We have seen these same tactics tried before in our own country: in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, and in a field in Pennsylvania. But for each time they have tried, terrorists have failed to shake the resolve of those they have targeted, and we will not allow them to succeed this time. The motto of the country of Belgium is ``eendracht maakt macht,'' ``unity makes strength.'' Let there be no doubt. We stand today united and strong with the people of Belgium. We will do whatever it takes, no matter how long it takes, to help Brussels rebuild and to bring all those responsible to justice. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member of the full committee. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Texas. I am pleased to join with them on this matter. I am pleased to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, we are sending a clear message that we stand with the people of Belgium. Like my colleagues and like so many around the world, I am angry, I am outraged, and I am deeply, deeply saddened by the terrorist attacks that ripped through Brussels yesterday. My heart goes out to those whose loved ones were killed or injured, and I am mindful there are families here in the United States that have been directly touched by this violence and that we are still uncertain how many Americans are themselves victims. For me, as a New Yorker, let me speak personally because September 11, 2001, is a scar and a stain that will never go away as long as I live and as long as other New Yorkers live. We know how it feels when hatred and violence take aim at our home. We know what it feels like when innocent people are killed by pure evil. So today we grieve with our brothers and sisters in Belgium. But in the midst of grief, we cannot lose focus on our work to stop this kind of violence. We need to stand with our Belgian friends not just in spirit, but in action, to figure out who was responsible for these attacks, how they were able to carry them out, and what it will take to hold them accountable. We need to look for new areas for collaboration in terms of prevention, surveillance, and information sharing. Along with our coalition partners, we need to press ahead in our effort to destroy ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for yesterday's attacks. How horrific, the thought that human life is so worthless to these terrorists. It is just absolutely amazing that they claim to be religious people but, instead, they are pure evil. ISIS terrorists and other violent extremists target democratic societies because they want to shatter our spirit and force us to live in fear. We will not allow them to succeed. Going forward, we will work with our Belgian partners and our other allies to move past this tragedy to fight terrorism, to enhance security, and to promote justice and democracy around the world. Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Again, I commend my good colleagues from Massachusetts and Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers and just will briefly close. Again, I want to thank my colleague from Texas. In a Congress that is often divided, we speak as one. In a country that is sometimes divided, today we speak as one. With the citizens of the world who value freedom and abhor violence and value human life, we speak as one. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I thank again the ranking member of our full committee as well as the chair of the full committee for joining with us. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the time. Mr. Speaker, our hearts do go out to the people of Brussels and the people who were killed and their families that are throughout the world, including those that are injured from the United States. We cannot bring back those lives from yesterday, but we can do something about the murder that occurred yesterday in Brussels. Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that the ISIS terror network is successful. ISIS exists for one reason, to murder people and, because of that murder and violence that they incur, to scare and to bring fear and terror to countries that are attacked by ISIS. As I mentioned earlier, they have committed terror attacks in now 20 countries. To some extent, it seems to me that it is working because every time there is a terrorist attack, free [[Page H1560]] people react in the sense that we find more security. I am concerned that we are getting into the bunker mentality, people afraid to go anyplace and afraid to leave. Why? Because some terrorist attack may occur. It is obvious that we need to react to the crimes and these murders as a people that are affected by it. But we can't just be defensive against ISIS and other terrorist organizations. We can't just defend ourselves. We have to eliminate ISIS. They are at war with the world and people who don't agree with them. They are at war. Now, we probably need to understand that their goal is to not only kill and maim, but to cause fear--fear--individual fear. They use every possible way they can do it, from social media to bragging about the murders on YouTube. So we, as a people, need to understand that we are going to have to eliminate ISIS. We are going to have to track them down, go get them, and eliminate them. You can't negotiate with these people. That is out of the question. So we either just react and try to defend ourselves when they commit crimes or we go after them. So I hope that the United States presents a better strategy and lets those folks know that, to just kill anybody that disagrees with ISIS, their days are numbered because we are going to go eliminate them. We have to. Because they have attacked us, our response must be more than defensive. We must be offensive. We must let them know: you can't do this. You can't kill people because you don't like them, no matter where that occurs in the world. So I would hope that the United States, with our partners in other countries, finds an overall strategy that is successful and that eliminates these people who kill because of a perverted sense of their religion. But today we do mourn the loss and we show the support of our country with our neighbors across the seas for the crimes that have been committed against them. As the ranking member has pointed out, this is an issue that is totally supported by both sides of the House. The Foreign Affairs Committee works together on almost all issues, and this is another example of that. With that, Mr. Speaker, that is just the way it is. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise n strong support of H. Res. 658 and in remembrance of the innocent victims who lost their lives, and those who were seriously injured, this morning in the barbaric attacks perpetrated by terrorists in Brussels, Belgium. Our hearts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims and our thanks and appreciation go to the first responders who selflessly came to the aid of their fellow members of the human family. Brussels will emerge from today's attacks stronger than ever and more firmly committed to the values and principles that have made it so great. And as Brussels recovers and responds, I hope its people take comfort in the certain knowledge that the people of the United States stand in solidarity with them. Today's attacks are a reminder of the common danger the free, democratic, and peace loving nations of the world face from those who reject the norms of civilized society and abuse the liberties and freedoms afforded them by free societies. Those responsible for today's crime against humanity should make no mistake; they will be held to account in this life and the next. But today our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Brussels, which represents everything terrorists despise: a symbol of the modern world where persons of differing faiths, creeds, races, and cultures live together in peace, harmony, and freedom. That symbol is recognizable to Americans because it also represents the American heart and spirit. The terrorist attacks in Brussels were horrific acts on innocent civilians perpetrated by depraved individuals who misuse the peaceful religion of Islam for their own misguided purposes. Their horrible and heinous acts are their responsibility, and theirs alone, and for which they can be assured that they alone will be held accountable. But that will come another day; today I ask a moment of silence for the victims killed and injured in the terrorist attacks in Brussels. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 658. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 658) condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Brussels on March 22, 2016, which murdered more than 30 innocent people, and severely wounded many more. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 658 Whereas, on March 22, 2016, at least three Islamist terrorists conducted coordinated attacks against two sites in Brussels, Belgium, resulting in the loss of more than 30 innocent lives and the severe wounding of many more innocent civilians; Whereas a number of American citizens are among those wounded; Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for the attacks; Whereas the brutal attacks at the Brussels airport and the Maelbeek metro station are the latest in a series of assaults by ISIS in Europe, including the November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, France, that were deliberately aimed at killing and maiming as many innocent people as possible; Whereas Belgian first responders and law enforcement reacted swiftly and heroically, caring for the wounded and taking immediate measures to prevent additional attacks and the further loss of life; Whereas at least two of the terrorists were killed in the suicide bombings, and Belgian intelligence and law enforcement are pursuing others possibly connected to these attacks and to those in Paris; Whereas Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called the attacks ``a black moment'' for the country and urged his fellow citizens to stay united in their response; Whereas Belgium and its capital Brussels are the symbolic center of the alliance between the United States and Europe that was created following the devastation of World War II, including by hosting on its territory the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the institutions of the European Union; Whereas Belgium and the United States have maintained strong ties based on shared values since Belgium's independence in 1831; Whereas Belgium was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and has been a steadfast ally of the United States in the decades since; Whereas, on September 12, 2001, for the first time in the history of the Alliance, Belgium joined our NATO allies to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty that states ``an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all''; Whereas Belgium has been a steadfast partner of the United States in the international effort to defeat ISIS and other terrorist threats; Whereas the coordination of these attacks, following the terrorist assaults in Paris and in several other countries, demonstrates that ISIS members continue to plan and execute attacks, targeting United States interests and allies; Whereas continued and enhanced intelligence cooperation, law enforcement engagement, and information sharing on emerging threats and identified Islamist extremists is essential to enhancing security for the people of the United States, Europe, and our allies around the world; Whereas the loss of innocent lives in Brussels strengthens our resolve to defeat ISIS and its terrorist affiliates which pose a growing threat to international peace and stability; and Whereas we stand in solidarity with our Belgian allies in their time of national mourning, ready to provide assistance in bringing to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these attacks, as well as identifying and disrupting any plans to undertake similar assaults in the future: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Brussels on March 22, 2016, which murdered more than 30 innocent people, and severely wounded many more; (2) expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences for those killed and injured in the attacks and for their families and friends; (3) pledges support for the Government of Belgium in its efforts to bring to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these terrorist attacks; (4) declares that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) poses a fundamental threat to the universal value of freedom in all countries; (5) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East and West and North Africa and the threat posed by these individuals; and (6) expresses its readiness to assist the Government and people of Belgium to respond to the threat posed by ISIS and its terrorist affiliates. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. {time} 0915 General Leave Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 658, condemning the series of terrorist attacks in Belgium carried out by Islamic extremists yesterday. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution, condemning the terrorist attacks in Brussels carried out by Islamist extremists yesterday. ISIS terrorists have once again struck in Europe, and this time in Belgium. The murderers coldly chose crowded areas at the Brussels Airport and at the metro system in order to kill and maim as many innocent men, women, and children as possible. And the latest numbers are 31 dead and 270 wounded, including a number of Americans. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, the latest in a series that includes an horrific attack in Brussels, the attack in Paris, a double suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, and the boast of responsibility for downing a Russian passenger jet in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The list of atrocities is far [[Page H1558]] longer, including those by ISIS affiliates elsewhere, such as the recent attack in Ivory Coast. As these and other assaults show, ISIS is rapidly expanding its reach beyond its bases in Syria and in Iraq. Over 30,000 fighters from more than 100 countries have joined ISIS, including more than 250 Americans. We had a young Yazidi girl tell us that she was taken as a concubine by one of these Americans who had been recruited 4 years ago on the Internet by ISIS. More than 4,500 of this terrorist diaspora hold Western passports and are but a plane ride away, a plane ride away from the United States and from Europe. This resolution puts the House on record as condemning the attacks in Brussels and extends our sympathies to those affected by this tragedy, and it reaffirms our support for the people of Belgium in their time of national anguish. But we must do more than just express our sorrow. We must take decisive action to eliminate the threat, including expanding information-sharing with our friends and allies, putting stronger border checks in place, combating the online propaganda and hate speech of ISIS extremists, and sharpening coalition efforts to destroy ISIS itself. I will remind the Members that our committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, has held a series of hearings on this. When ISIS came out of Raqqa in the first place and headed towards the border and headed towards Fallujah, that was the time to hit this so-called JV team. This group of guys in pickup trucks, as the President called them at the time, were an open target on the open desert as they headed to Fallujah and, after that, as they headed to city after city after city without us using our airpower to hit them early on. They finally took Mosul and, with it, they took the Central Bank of Iraq. At this point, they have to be destroyed, and it is going to take a strategic plan to make certain the United States leads in that effort. We need to get it done. Mr. KEATING. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 658, a resolution condemning yesterday's tragic attack in Brussels, Belgium. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Texas, Judge Ted Poe, chairman of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, on which I serve as the ranking member, in expressing my deepest condolences to the victims, families, and loved ones of those affected by yesterday's brutal attacks. The resolution before us today strongly condemns the terrorist attacks perpetrated in Brussels yesterday and expresses the sympathy of the House of Representatives for the people of Belgium. With the strength of the U.S. intelligence community, we pledge our support for the Belgian Government in its efforts to investigate and to bring to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these deadly plans. Belgium remains one of our strongest allies, a nation with which we have worked closely in bilateral and multilateral arenas. Belgium was on our side as an active participant in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, as a leader in the European Union mission in Mali, and as an ally in the 2010-2011 NATO operations in Libya. As host of the European Union and NATO headquarters, Belgium-- Brussels, in particular--represents both a symbolic and a concrete role in promoting transatlantic cooperation between our two countries and our allies. It is not by accident that the Maelbeek metro station and the Brussels Airport were selected as the site for such heinous violence. Nearby, a mere stone's throw from the Maelbeek station, sits the headquarters of the European Union and numerous government offices, including the U.S. Embassy, which is less than a mile away. Daily, hundreds, if not thousands of civil servants and public interest sector workers cross through the station on the way back and forth to work. And at Brussels Airport, dozens of innocent travelers and family members were drawn into a bloodshed that has spread from Iraq and Syria to the surrounding region and beyond. I visited both while in Europe last year on a security codel, and I saw, firsthand, the strong police presence providing a sense of security for Brussels residents and visitors. Due to the bravery, courage, and preparedness of Belgian law enforcement authorities and emergency response teams, many families were spared the pain of losing a loved one. And we honor, today, their quick action and their bravery. These terrorist attacks are misguided attempts to divide the global coalition that has come together to degrade and defeat ISIS and their affiliates. From Ankara, to Istanbul, to Beirut, to Baga, we recognize that the prominent sentiment across the Middle East identifies ISIS rhetoric and actions as contrary to the tolerance and teachings of Islam. While this remains an open investigation, the nature of yesterday's attacks hit close to home. Whether it is New York City, San Bernardino, or whether it is Boston--where I saw, firsthand, the resilience in spirit come forward that any physical attack can never conquer--we see that same spirit and resolve in the people of Brussels and Belgium today. The flow of foreign fighters, the traveling that they do, and the extenuating threat that they pose have been our top security-related concerns here in Congress. Congress and the administration have taken actions to address these issues and prevent the risk of such an attack here at home. We have tightened security restrictions for travelers from visa waiver countries who are known to have traveled to Iraq and Syria. We have sealed intelligence-sharing gaps between Federal, State, and local law enforcement, as well as our international partners in the intelligence community. And we are in the process of an unprecedented top-to-bottom review of airport security threats that will ensure our airports are safer than ever. The international community, including governments and prominent organizations throughout the Middle East and Muslim-majority nations, have spoken out against these heinous attacks. With passage of this resolution, the U.S. Congress joins these communities around the world in its condemnation of the terrorist attacks yesterday in Brussels. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) for his comments, for his support of this legislation, and also for the privilege to work with him on our Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, where we have had numerous hearings on the issue of ISIS and other terrorist groups that are lurking throughout the United States and the world. Mr. Speaker, the attacks began shortly before 8 a.m., with an explosion at a departure terminal at the Brussels Airport. The area was between two American airlines--American Airlines and Delta Air Lines-- American companies. It was believed to be a luggage bomb, followed by another bomb shortly thereafter. Then, at 9:11 a.m., Brussels time, a bomb tore through the last car of a subway train as it was pulling out of a station in central Brussels. Belgian officials have said that the bombings killed at least 10 at the airport and at least 20 at the subway station. More than 230 others were wounded. Details are still surfacing, but we now know that at least 10 Americans were wounded in the attacks. One of those was a member of the United States Air Force. Later in the afternoon, a news agency affiliated with ISIS issued a report bragging and claiming responsibility for the murders. Reports said that the attacks were in retaliation for Belgium's participation in a coalition against ISIS. Mr. Speaker, ISIS, this group that is relatively new in the terrorist industry, has already committed 70 terrorist attacks worldwide in 20 countries, as of January 1 of this year, and yet this is one more. These attacks in Belgium occurred just 4 days after the capture of one of Europe's most wanted terrorists, [[Page H1559]] Salah Abdeslam, the sole survivor of the 10 men who carried out the November horrific attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. The attacks in Belgium made it clear to all that ISIS still maintains operational networks in Europe, capable of carrying out attacks abroad, even as security services are on highest alert. The bombing in downtown Brussels occurred just steps away from major institutions, as the ranking member, Mr. Keating, has pointed out. Brussels is the capital of Belgium. It is the headquarters of the European Union. It is the headquarters of NATO. This bombing attack occurred near the U.S. Embassy that is there. This area, Brussels, Belgium, stands and represents, really, the free world's endeavor to work together under democracy and liberty and those ideals that we value. It was no accident that Brussels was picked for the attack. The fact that ISIS could operate cells in Europe and manage to strike at the heart of European society only a few months after the Paris attacks should make us cognizant that our current strategy against ISIS is really not successful. ISIS has been able to hold on to territory for close to 2 years. It is from this territory in Iraq and Syria that it trains its fighters, recruits foreigners, and plans to launch attacks against not only Europe, but other countries, like the United States. Words claiming progress and success against ISIS are meaningless when confronted with devastating carnage like what we saw in the United States, in San Bernardino, and what occurred in Paris and now in Brussels. The United States must change its strategy against ISIS. We must allow ISIS no safe haven anywhere in the world. We must take away their capabilities to strike American cities. This resolution shows that the people of the United States stand alongside our European and Belgian allies in solidarity. The American people extend their deepest sympathies to those affected by the tragedy. Let the people of Belgium know that the United States will support them through this time in every way possible, and we must be more united in the face of this terrorist onslaught that threatens the very freedoms that we hold dear. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my colleague and fellow New Englander. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank both the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Texas for their extraordinary leadership on this important resolution. Yesterday, the world saw the face of evil in a series of cowardly and despicable terrorist acts that claimed the lives of 34 innocent people in Brussels. I, too, extend my thoughts and prayers to all of the families affected by this horrific violence. At the same time, Mr. Speaker, here in Congress, we must renew our commitment to keep Americans safe from terrorism, continue to support our intelligence services and law enforcement agencies in their critical work, and do all that is necessary to defeat and destroy these terrorists wherever they are. {time} 0930 Today the United States and the entire world are standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Belgium. The ISIS terrorists who perpetrated these attacks did so in an attempt to strike fear into the heart of anyone who does not share their radical world views. We have seen these same tactics tried before in our own country: in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, and in a field in Pennsylvania. But for each time they have tried, terrorists have failed to shake the resolve of those they have targeted, and we will not allow them to succeed this time. The motto of the country of Belgium is ``eendracht maakt macht,'' ``unity makes strength.'' Let there be no doubt. We stand today united and strong with the people of Belgium. We will do whatever it takes, no matter how long it takes, to help Brussels rebuild and to bring all those responsible to justice. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member of the full committee. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Texas. I am pleased to join with them on this matter. I am pleased to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, we are sending a clear message that we stand with the people of Belgium. Like my colleagues and like so many around the world, I am angry, I am outraged, and I am deeply, deeply saddened by the terrorist attacks that ripped through Brussels yesterday. My heart goes out to those whose loved ones were killed or injured, and I am mindful there are families here in the United States that have been directly touched by this violence and that we are still uncertain how many Americans are themselves victims. For me, as a New Yorker, let me speak personally because September 11, 2001, is a scar and a stain that will never go away as long as I live and as long as other New Yorkers live. We know how it feels when hatred and violence take aim at our home. We know what it feels like when innocent people are killed by pure evil. So today we grieve with our brothers and sisters in Belgium. But in the midst of grief, we cannot lose focus on our work to stop this kind of violence. We need to stand with our Belgian friends not just in spirit, but in action, to figure out who was responsible for these attacks, how they were able to carry them out, and what it will take to hold them accountable. We need to look for new areas for collaboration in terms of prevention, surveillance, and information sharing. Along with our coalition partners, we need to press ahead in our effort to destroy ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for yesterday's attacks. How horrific, the thought that human life is so worthless to these terrorists. It is just absolutely amazing that they claim to be religious people but, instead, they are pure evil. ISIS terrorists and other violent extremists target democratic societies because they want to shatter our spirit and force us to live in fear. We will not allow them to succeed. Going forward, we will work with our Belgian partners and our other allies to move past this tragedy to fight terrorism, to enhance security, and to promote justice and democracy around the world.

I thank again the ranking member of our full committee as well as the chair of the full committee for joining with us. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the time.

Res. 658 Whereas, on March 22, 2016, at least three Islamist terrorists conducted coordinated attacks against two sites in Brussels, Belgium, resulting in the loss of more than 30 innocent lives and the severe wounding of many more innocent civilians; Whereas a number of American citizens are among those wounded; Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for the attacks; Whereas the brutal attacks at the Brussels airport and the Maelbeek metro station are the latest in a series of assaults by ISIS in Europe, including the November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, France, that were deliberately aimed at killing and maiming as many innocent people as possible; Whereas Belgian first responders and law enforcement reacted swiftly and heroically, caring for the wounded and taking immediate measures to prevent additional attacks and the further loss of life; Whereas at least two of the terrorists were killed in the suicide bombings, and Belgian intelligence and law enforcement are pursuing others possibly connected to these attacks and to those in Paris; Whereas Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called the attacks ``a black moment'' for the country and urged his fellow citizens to stay united in their response; Whereas Belgium and its capital Brussels are the symbolic center of the alliance between the United States and Europe that was created following the devastation of World War II, including by hosting on its territory the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the institutions of the European Union; Whereas Belgium and the United States have maintained strong ties based on shared values since Belgium's independence in 1831; Whereas Belgium was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and has been a steadfast ally of the United States in the decades since; Whereas, on September 12, 2001, for the first time in the history of the Alliance, Belgium joined our NATO allies to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty that states ``an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all''; Whereas Belgium has been a steadfast partner of the United States in the international effort to defeat ISIS and other terrorist threats; Whereas the coordination of these attacks, following the terrorist assaults in Paris and in several other countries, demonstrates that ISIS members continue to plan and execute attacks, targeting United States interests and allies; Whereas continued and enhanced intelligence cooperation, law enforcement engagement, and information sharing on emerging threats and identified Islamist extremists is essential to enhancing security for the people of the United States, Europe, and our allies around the world; Whereas the loss of innocent lives in Brussels strengthens our resolve to defeat ISIS and its terrorist affiliates which pose a growing threat to international peace and stability; and Whereas we stand in solidarity with our Belgian allies in their time of national mourning, ready to provide assistance in bringing to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these attacks, as well as identifying and disrupting any plans to undertake similar assaults in the future: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Brussels on March 22, 2016, which murdered more than 30 innocent people, and severely wounded many more; (2) expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences for those killed and injured in the attacks and for their families and friends; (3) pledges support for the Government of Belgium in its efforts to bring to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these terrorist attacks; (4) declares that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) poses a fundamental threat to the universal value of freedom in all countries; (5) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East and West and North Africa and the threat posed by these individuals; and (6) expresses its readiness to assist the Government and people of Belgium to respond to the threat posed by ISIS and its terrorist affiliates. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. {time} 0915 General Leave Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 658, condemning the series of terrorist attacks in Belgium carried out by Islamic extremists yesterday. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution, condemning the terrorist attacks in Brussels carried out by Islamist extremists yesterday. ISIS terrorists have once again struck in Europe, and this time in Belgium. The murderers coldly chose crowded areas at the Brussels Airport and at the metro system in order to kill and maim as many innocent men, women, and children as possible. And the latest numbers are 31 dead and 270 wounded, including a number of Americans. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, the latest in a series that includes an horrific attack in Brussels, the attack in Paris, a double suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, and the boast of responsibility for downing a Russian passenger jet in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The list of atrocities is far [[Page H1558]] longer, including those by ISIS affiliates elsewhere, such as the recent attack in Ivory Coast. As these and other assaults show, ISIS is rapidly expanding its reach beyond its bases in Syria and in Iraq. Over 30,000 fighters from more than 100 countries have joined ISIS, including more than 250 Americans. We had a young Yazidi girl tell us that she was taken as a concubine by one of these Americans who had been recruited 4 years ago on the Internet by ISIS. More than 4,500 of this terrorist diaspora hold Western passports and are but a plane ride away, a plane ride away from the United States and from Europe. This resolution puts the House on record as condemning the attacks in Brussels and extends our sympathies to those affected by this tragedy, and it reaffirms our support for the people of Belgium in their time of national anguish. But we must do more than just express our sorrow. We must take decisive action to eliminate the threat, including expanding information-sharing with our friends and allies, putting stronger border checks in place, combating the online propaganda and hate speech of ISIS extremists, and sharpening coalition efforts to destroy ISIS itself. I will remind the Members that our committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, has held a series of hearings on this. When ISIS came out of Raqqa in the first place and headed towards the border and headed towards Fallujah, that was the time to hit this so-called JV team. This group of guys in pickup trucks, as the President called them at the time, were an open target on the open desert as they headed to Fallujah and, after that, as they headed to city after city after city without us using our airpower to hit them early on. They finally took Mosul and, with it, they took the Central Bank of Iraq. At this point, they have to be destroyed, and it is going to take a strategic plan to make certain the United States leads in that effort. We need to get it done. Mr. KEATING. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 658, a resolution condemning yesterday's tragic attack in Brussels, Belgium. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Texas, Judge Ted Poe, chairman of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, on which I serve as the ranking member, in expressing my deepest condolences to the victims, families, and loved ones of those affected by yesterday's brutal attacks. The resolution before us today strongly condemns the terrorist attacks perpetrated in Brussels yesterday and expresses the sympathy of the House of Representatives for the people of Belgium. With the strength of the U.S. intelligence community, we pledge our support for the Belgian Government in its efforts to investigate and to bring to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these deadly plans. Belgium remains one of our strongest allies, a nation with which we have worked closely in bilateral and multilateral arenas. Belgium was on our side as an active participant in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, as a leader in the European Union mission in Mali, and as an ally in the 2010-2011 NATO operations in Libya. As host of the European Union and NATO headquarters, Belgium-- Brussels, in particular--represents both a symbolic and a concrete role in promoting transatlantic cooperation between our two countries and our allies. It is not by accident that the Maelbeek metro station and the Brussels Airport were selected as the site for such heinous violence. Nearby, a mere stone's throw from the Maelbeek station, sits the headquarters of the European Union and numerous government offices, including the U.S. Embassy, which is less than a mile away. Daily, hundreds, if not thousands of civil servants and public interest sector workers cross through the station on the way back and forth to work. And at Brussels Airport, dozens of innocent travelers and family members were drawn into a bloodshed that has spread from Iraq and Syria to the surrounding region and beyond. I visited both while in Europe last year on a security codel, and I saw, firsthand, the strong police presence providing a sense of security for Brussels residents and visitors. Due to the bravery, courage, and preparedness of Belgian law enforcement authorities and emergency response teams, many families were spared the pain of losing a loved one. And we honor, today, their quick action and their bravery. These terrorist attacks are misguided attempts to divide the global coalition that has come together to degrade and defeat ISIS and their affiliates. From Ankara, to Istanbul, to Beirut, to Baga, we recognize that the prominent sentiment across the Middle East identifies ISIS rhetoric and actions as contrary to the tolerance and teachings of Islam. While this remains an open investigation, the nature of yesterday's attacks hit close to home. Whether it is New York City, San Bernardino, or whether it is Boston--where I saw, firsthand, the resilience in spirit come forward that any physical attack can never conquer--we see that same spirit and resolve in the people of Brussels and Belgium today. The flow of foreign fighters, the traveling that they do, and the extenuating threat that they pose have been our top security-related concerns here in Congress. Congress and the administration have taken actions to address these issues and prevent the risk of such an attack here at home. We have tightened security restrictions for travelers from visa waiver countries who are known to have traveled to Iraq and Syria. We have sealed intelligence-sharing gaps between Federal, State, and local law enforcement, as well as our international partners in the intelligence community. And we are in the process of an unprecedented top-to-bottom review of airport security threats that will ensure our airports are safer than ever. The international community, including governments and prominent organizations throughout the Middle East and Muslim-majority nations, have spoken out against these heinous attacks. With passage of this resolution, the U.S. Congress joins these communities around the world in its condemnation of the terrorist attacks yesterday in Brussels. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) for his comments, for his support of this legislation, and also for the privilege to work with him on our Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, where we have had numerous hearings on the issue of ISIS and other terrorist groups that are lurking throughout the United States and the world. Mr. Speaker, the attacks began shortly before 8 a.m., with an explosion at a departure terminal at the Brussels Airport. The area was between two American airlines--American Airlines and Delta Air Lines-- American companies. It was believed to be a luggage bomb, followed by another bomb shortly thereafter. Then, at 9:11 a.m., Brussels time, a bomb tore through the last car of a subway train as it was pulling out of a station in central Brussels. Belgian officials have said that the bombings killed at least 10 at the airport and at least 20 at the subway station. More than 230 others were wounded. Details are still surfacing, but we now know that at least 10 Americans were wounded in the attacks. One of those was a member of the United States Air Force. Later in the afternoon, a news agency affiliated with ISIS issued a report bragging and claiming responsibility for the murders. Reports said that the attacks were in retaliation for Belgium's participation in a coalition against ISIS. Mr. Speaker, ISIS, this group that is relatively new in the terrorist industry, has already committed 70 terrorist attacks worldwide in 20 countries, as of January 1 of this year, and yet this is one more. These attacks in Belgium occurred just 4 days after the capture of one of Europe's most wanted terrorists, [[Page H1559]] Salah Abdeslam, the sole survivor of the 10 men who carried out the November horrific attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. The attacks in Belgium made it clear to all that ISIS still maintains operational networks in Europe, capable of carrying out attacks abroad, even as security services are on highest alert. The bombing in downtown Brussels occurred just steps away from major institutions, as the ranking member, Mr. Keating, has pointed out. Brussels is the capital of Belgium. It is the headquarters of the European Union. It is the headquarters of NATO. This bombing attack occurred near the U.S. Embassy that is there. This area, Brussels, Belgium, stands and represents, really, the free world's endeavor to work together under democracy and liberty and those ideals that we value. It was no accident that Brussels was picked for the attack. The fact that ISIS could operate cells in Europe and manage to strike at the heart of European society only a few months after the Paris attacks should make us cognizant that our current strategy against ISIS is really not successful. ISIS has been able to hold on to territory for close to 2 years. It is from this territory in Iraq and Syria that it trains its fighters, recruits foreigners, and plans to launch attacks against not only Europe, but other countries, like the United States. Words claiming progress and success against ISIS are meaningless when confronted with devastating carnage like what we saw in the United States, in San Bernardino, and what occurred in Paris and now in Brussels. The United States must change its strategy against ISIS. We must allow ISIS no safe haven anywhere in the world. We must take away their capabilities to strike American cities. This resolution shows that the people of the United States stand alongside our European and Belgian allies in solidarity. The American people extend their deepest sympathies to those affected by the tragedy. Let the people of Belgium know that the United States will support them through this time in every way possible, and we must be more united in the face of this terrorist onslaught that threatens the very freedoms that we hold dear. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my colleague and fellow New Englander. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank both the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Texas for their extraordinary leadership on this important resolution. Yesterday, the world saw the face of evil in a series of cowardly and despicable terrorist acts that claimed the lives of 34 innocent people in Brussels. I, too, extend my thoughts and prayers to all of the families affected by this horrific violence. At the same time, Mr. Speaker, here in Congress, we must renew our commitment to keep Americans safe from terrorism, continue to support our intelligence services and law enforcement agencies in their critical work, and do all that is necessary to defeat and destroy these terrorists wherever they are. {time} 0930 Today the United States and the entire world are standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Belgium. The ISIS terrorists who perpetrated these attacks did so in an attempt to strike fear into the heart of anyone who does not share their radical world views. We have seen these same tactics tried before in our own country: in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, and in a field in Pennsylvania. But for each time they have tried, terrorists have failed to shake the resolve of those they have targeted, and we will not allow them to succeed this time. The motto of the country of Belgium is ``eendracht maakt macht,'' ``unity makes strength.'' Let there be no doubt. We stand today united and strong with the people of Belgium. We will do whatever it takes, no matter how long it takes, to help Brussels rebuild and to bring all those responsible to justice. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member of the full committee. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from Texas. I am pleased to join with them on this matter. I am pleased to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, we are sending a clear message that we stand with the people of Belgium. Like my colleagues and like so many around the world, I am angry, I am outraged, and I am deeply, deeply saddened by the terrorist attacks that ripped through Brussels yesterday. My heart goes out to those whose loved ones were killed or injured, and I am mindful there are families here in the United States that have been directly touched by this violence and that we are still uncertain how many Americans are themselves victims. For me, as a New Yorker, let me speak personally because September 11, 2001, is a scar and a stain that will never go away as long as I live and as long as other New Yorkers live. We know how it feels when hatred and violence take aim at our home. We know what it feels like when innocent people are killed by pure evil. So today we grieve with our brothers and sisters in Belgium. But in the midst of grief, we cannot lose focus on our work to stop this kind of violence. We need to stand with our Belgian friends not just in spirit, but in action, to figure out who was responsible for these attacks, how they were able to carry them out, and what it will take to hold them accountable. We need to look for new areas for collaboration in terms of prevention, surveillance, and information sharing. Along with our coalition partners, we need to press ahead in our effort to destroy ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for yesterday's attacks. How horrific, the thought that human life is so worthless to these terrorists. It is just absolutely amazing that they claim to be religious people but, instead, they are pure evil. ISIS terrorists and other violent extremists target democratic societies because they want to shatter our spirit and force us to live in fear. We will not allow them to succeed. Going forward, we will work with our Belgian partners and our other allies to move past this tragedy to fight terrorism, to enhance security, and to promote justice and democracy around the world. Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Again, I commend my good colleagues from Massachusetts and Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers and just will briefly close. Again, I want to thank my colleague from Texas. In a Congress that is often divided, we speak as one. In a country that is sometimes divided, today we speak as one. With the citizens of the world who value freedom and abhor violence and value human life, we speak as one. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I thank again the ranking member of our full committee as well as the chair of the full committee for joining with us. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the time. Mr. Speaker, our hearts do go out to the people of Brussels and the people who were killed and their families that are throughout the world, including those that are injured from the United States. We cannot bring back those lives from yesterday, but we can do something about the murder that occurred yesterday in Brussels. Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that the ISIS terror network is successful. ISIS exists for one reason, to murder people and, because of that murder and violence that they incur, to scare and to bring fear and terror to countries that are attacked by ISIS. As I mentioned earlier, they have committed terror attacks in now 20 countries. To some extent, it seems to me that it is working because every time there is a terrorist attack, free [[Page H1560]] people react in the sense that we find more security. I am concerned that we are getting into the bunker mentality, people afraid to go anyplace and afraid to leave. Why? Because some terrorist attack may occur. It is obvious that we need to react to the crimes and these murders as a people that are affected by it. But we can't just be defensive against ISIS and other terrorist organizations. We can't just defend ourselves. We have to eliminate ISIS. They are at war with the world and people who don't agree with them. They are at war. Now, we probably need to understand that their goal is to not only kill and maim, but to cause fear--fear--individual fear. They use every possible way they can do it, from social media to bragging about the murders on YouTube. So we, as a people, need to understand that we are going to have to eliminate ISIS. We are going to have to track them down, go get them, and eliminate them. You can't negotiate with these people. That is out of the question. So we either just react and try to defend ourselves when they commit crimes or we go after them. So I hope that the United States presents a better strategy and lets those folks know that, to just kill anybody that disagrees with ISIS, their days are numbered because we are going to go eliminate them. We have to. Because they have attacked us, our response must be more than defensive. We must be offensive. We must let them know: you can't do this. You can't kill people because you don't like them, no matter where that occurs in the world. So I would hope that the United States, with our partners in other countries, finds an overall strategy that is successful and that eliminates these people who kill because of a perverted sense of their religion. But today we do mourn the loss and we show the support of our country with our neighbors across the seas for the crimes that have been committed against them. As the ranking member has pointed out, this is an issue that is totally supported by both sides of the House. The Foreign Affairs Committee works together on almost all issues, and this is another example of that. With that, Mr. Speaker, that is just the way it is. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise n strong support of H. Res. 658 and in remembrance of the innocent victims who lost their lives, and those who were seriously injured, this morning in the barbaric attacks perpetrated by terrorists in Brussels, Belgium. Our hearts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims and our thanks and appreciation go to the first responders who selflessly came to the aid of their fellow members of the human family. Brussels will emerge from today's attacks stronger than ever and more firmly committed to the values and principles that have made it so great. And as Brussels recovers and responds, I hope its people take comfort in the certain knowledge that the people of the United States stand in solidarity with them. Today's attacks are a reminder of the common danger the free, democratic, and peace loving nations of the world face from those who reject the norms of civilized society and abuse the liberties and freedoms afforded them by free societies. Those responsible for today's crime against humanity should make no mistake; they will be held to account in this life and the next. But today our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Brussels, which represents everything terrorists despise: a symbol of the modern world where persons of differing faiths, creeds, races, and cultures live together in peace, harmony, and freedom. That symbol is recognizable to Americans because it also represents the American heart and spirit. The terrorist attacks in Brussels were horrific acts on innocent civilians perpetrated by depraved individuals who misuse the peaceful religion of Islam for their own misguided purposes. Their horrible and heinous acts are their responsibility, and theirs alone, and for which they can be assured that they alone will be held accountable. But that will come another day; today I ask a moment of silence for the victims killed and injured in the terrorist attacks in Brussels. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 658. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_292.csv,27454,27454,27524,"[congressional record volume 162, number 46

to the bravery, courage, and preparedness of belgian law enforcement authorities and emergency response teams, many families were spared the pain of losing a loved one. and we honor, today, their quick action and their bravery. these terrorist attacks are misguided attempts to divide the global coalition that has come together to degrade and defeat isis and their affiliates. from ankara, to istanbul, to beirut, to baga, we recognize that the prominent sentiment across the middle east identifies isis rhetoric and actions as contrary to the tolerance and teachings of islam. while this remains an open investigation, the nature of yesterday's attacks hit close to home. whether it is new york city, san bernardino, or whether it is boston--where i saw, firsthand, the resilience in spirit come forward that any physical attack can never conquer--we see that same spirit and resolve in the people of brussels and belgium today. the flow of foreign fighters, the traveling that they do, and the extenuating threat that they pose have been our top security-related concerns here in congress. congress and the administration have taken actions to address these issues and prevent the risk of such an attack here at home. we have tightened security restrictions for travelers from visa waiver countries who are known to have traveled to iraq and syria. we have sealed intelligence-sharing gaps between federal, state, and local law enforcement, as well as our international partners in the intelligence community. and we are in the process of an unprecedented top-to-bottom review of airport security threats that will ensure our airports are safer than ever. the international community, including governments and prominent organizations throughout the middle east and muslim-majority nations, have spoken out against these heinous attacks. with passage of this resolution, the u.s. congress joins these communities around the world in its condemnation of the terrorist attacks yesterday in brussels. i urge my colleagues to support this resolution. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i do want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. keating) for his comments, for his support of this legislation, and also for the privilege to work with him on our terrorism, nonproliferation, and trade subcommittee, where we have had numerous hearings on the issue of isis and other terrorist groups that are lurking throughout the united states and the world. mr. speaker, the attacks began shortly before 8 a.m., with an explosion at a departure terminal at the brussels airport. the area was between two american airlines--american airlines and delta air lines-- american companies. it was believed to be a luggage bomb, followed by another bomb shortly thereafter. then, at 9:11 a.m., brussels time, a bomb tore through the last car of a subway train as it was pulling out of a station in central brussels. belgian officials have said that the bombings killed at least 10 at the airport and at least 20 at the subway station. more than 230 others were wounded. details are still surfacing, but we now know that at least 10 americans were wounded in the attacks. one of those was a member of the united states air force. later in the afternoon, a news agency affiliated with isis issued a report bragging and claiming responsibility for the murders. reports said that the attacks were in retaliation for belgium's participation in a coalition against isis. mr. speaker, isis, this group that is relatively new in the terrorist industry, has already committed 70 terrorist attacks worldwide in 20 countries, as of january 1 of this year, and yet this is one more. these attacks in belgium occurred just 4 days after the capture of one of europe's most wanted terrorists, [[page h1559]] salah abdeslam, the sole survivor of the 10 men who carried out the november horrific attacks in paris that killed 130 people. the attacks in belgium made it clear to all that isis still maintains operational networks in europe, capable of carrying out attacks abroad, even as security services are on highest alert. the bombing in downtown brussels occurred just steps away from major institutions, as the ranking member, mr. keating, has pointed out. brussels is the capital of belgium. it is the headquarters of the european union. it is the headquarters of nato. this bombing attack occurred near the u.s. embassy that is there. this area, brussels, belgium, stands and represents, really, the free world's endeavor to work together under democracy and liberty and those ideals that we value. it was no accident that brussels was picked for the attack. the fact that isis could operate cells in europe and manage to strike at the heart of european society only a few months after the paris attacks should make us cognizant that our current strategy against isis is really not successful. isis has been able to hold on to territory for close to 2 years. it is from this territory in iraq and syria that it trains its fighters, recruits foreigners, and plans to launch attacks against not only europe, but other countries, like the united states. words claiming progress and success against isis are meaningless when confronted with devastating carnage like what we saw in the united states, in san bernardino, and what occurred in paris and now in brussels. the united states must change its strategy against isis. we must allow isis no safe haven anywhere in the world. we must take away their capabilities to strike american cities. this resolution shows that the people of the united states stand alongside our european and belgian allies in solidarity. the american people extend their deepest sympathies to those affected by the tragedy. let the people of belgium know that the united states will support them through this time in every way possible, and we must be more united in the face of this terrorist onslaught that threatens the very freedoms that we hold dear. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. keating. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from rhode island (mr. cicilline), my colleague and fellow new englander. mr. cicilline. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding, and i thank both the gentleman from massachusetts and the gentleman from texas for their extraordinary leadership on this important resolution. yesterday, the world saw the face of evil in a series of cowardly and despicable terrorist acts that claimed the lives of 34 innocent people in brussels. i, too, extend my thoughts and prayers to all of the families affected by this horrific violence. at the same time, mr. speaker, here in congress, we must renew our commitment to keep americans safe from terrorism, continue to support our intelligence services and law enforcement agencies in their critical work, and do all that is necessary to defeat and destroy these terrorists wherever they are. {time} 0930 today the united states and the entire world are standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of belgium. the isis terrorists who perpetrated these attacks did so in an attempt to strike fear into the heart of anyone who does not share their radical world views. we have seen these same tactics tried before in our own country: in san bernardino, at the boston marathon, the pentagon, the world trade center, and in a field in pennsylvania. but for each time they have tried, terrorists have failed to shake the resolve of those they have targeted, and we will not allow them to succeed this time. the motto of the country of belgium is ``eendracht maakt macht,'' ``unity makes strength.'' let there be no doubt. we stand today united and strong with the people of belgium. we will do whatever it takes, no matter how long it takes, to help brussels rebuild and to bring all those responsible to justice. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. keating. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. engel), the ranking member of the full committee. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from massachusetts and the gentleman from texas. i am pleased to join with them on this matter. i am pleased to support this measure. mr. speaker, with this resolution, we are sending a clear message that we stand with the people of belgium. like my colleagues and like so many around the world, i am angry, i am outraged, and i am deeply, deeply saddened by the terrorist attacks that ripped through brussels yesterday. my heart goes out to those whose loved ones were killed or injured, and i am mindful there are families here in the united states that have been directly touched by this violence and that we are still uncertain how many americans are themselves victims. for me, as a new yorker, let me speak personally because september 11, 2001, is a scar and a stain that will never go away as long as i live and as long as other new yorkers live. we know how it feels when hatred and violence take aim at our home. we know what it feels like when innocent people are killed by pure evil. so today we grieve with our brothers and sisters in belgium. but in the midst of grief, we cannot lose focus on our work to stop this kind of violence. we need to stand with our belgian friends not just in spirit, but in action, to figure out who was responsible for these attacks, how they were able to carry them out, and what it will take to hold them accountable. we need to look for new areas for collaboration in terms of prevention, surveillance, and information sharing. along with our coalition partners, we need to press ahead in our effort to destroy isis, which has claimed responsibility for yesterday's attacks. how horrific, the thought that human life is so worthless to these terrorists. it is just absolutely amazing that they claim to be religious people but, instead, they are pure evil. isis terrorists and other violent extremists target democratic societies because they want to shatter our spirit and force us to live in fear. we will not allow them to succeed. going forward, we will work with our belgian partners and our other allies to move past this tragedy to fight terrorism, to enhance security, and to promote justice and democracy around the world. mr. speaker, i support this resolution, and i urge my colleagues to do the same. again, i commend my good colleagues from massachusetts and texas. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. keating. mr. speaker, i have no more speakers and just will briefly close. again, i want to thank my colleague from texas. in a congress that is often divided, we speak as one. in a country that is sometimes divided, today we speak as one. with the citizens of the world who value freedom and abhor violence and value human life, we speak as one. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this resolution. i thank again the ranking member of our full committee as well as the chair of the full committee for joining with us. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself the remainder of the time. mr. speaker, our hearts do go out to the people of brussels and the people who were killed and their families that are throughout the world, including those that are injured from the united states. we cannot bring back those lives from yesterday, but we can do something about the murder that occurred yesterday in brussels. mr. speaker, it seems to me that the isis terror network is successful. isis exists for one reason, to murder people and, because of that murder and violence that they incur, to scare and to bring fear and terror to countries that are attacked by isis. as i mentioned earlier, they have committed terror attacks in now 20 countries. to some extent, it seems to me that it is working because every time there is a terrorist attack, free [[page h1560]] people react in the sense that we find more security. i am concerned that we are getting into the bunker mentality, people afraid to go anyplace and afraid to leave. why? because some terrorist attack may occur. it is obvious that we need to react to the crimes and these murders as a people that are affected by it. but we can't just be defensive against isis and other terrorist organizations. we can't just defend ourselves. we have to eliminate isis. they are at war with the world and people who don't agree with them. they are at war. now, we probably need to understand that their goal is to not only kill and maim, but to cause fear--fear--individual fear. they use every possible way they can do it, from social media to bragging about the murders on youtube. so we, as a people, need to understand that we are going to have to eliminate isis. we are going to have to track them down, go get them, and eliminate them. you can't negotiate with these people. that is out of the question. so we either just react and try to defend ourselves when they commit crimes or we go after them. so i hope that the united states presents a better strategy and lets those folks know that, to just kill anybody that disagrees with isis, their days are numbered because we are going to go eliminate them. we have to. because they have attacked us, our response must be more than defensive. we must be offensive. we must let them know: you can't do this. you can't kill people because you don't like them, no matter where that occurs in the world. so i would hope that the united states, with our partners in other countries, finds an overall strategy that is successful and that eliminates these people who kill because of a perverted sense of their religion. but today we do mourn the loss and we show the support of our country with our neighbors across the seas for the crimes that have been committed against them. as the ranking member has pointed out, this is an issue that is totally supported by both sides of the house. the foreign affairs committee works together on almost all issues, and this is another example of that. with that, mr. speaker, that is just the way it is. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise n strong support of h. res. 658 and in remembrance of the innocent victims who lost their lives, and those who were seriously injured, this morning in the barbaric attacks perpetrated by terrorists in brussels, belgium. our hearts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims and our thanks and appreciation go to the first responders who selflessly came to the aid of their fellow members of the human family. brussels will emerge from today's attacks stronger than ever and more firmly committed to the values and principles that have made it so great. and as brussels recovers and responds, i hope its people take comfort in the certain knowledge that the people of the united states stand in solidarity with them. today's attacks are a reminder of the common danger the free, democratic, and peace loving nations of the world face from those who reject the norms of civilized society and abuse the liberties and freedoms afforded them by free societies. those responsible for today's crime against humanity should make no mistake; they will be held to account in this life and the next. but today our thoughts and prayers are with the people of brussels, which represents everything terrorists despise: a symbol of the modern world where persons of differing faiths, creeds, races, and cultures live together in peace, harmony, and freedom. that symbol is recognizable to americans because it also represents the american heart and spirit. the terrorist attacks in brussels were horrific acts on innocent civilians perpetrated by depraved individuals who misuse the peaceful religion of islam for their own misguided purposes. their horrible and heinous acts are their responsibility, and theirs alone, and for which they can be assured that they alone will be held accountable. but that will come another day; today i ask a moment of silence for the victims killed and injured in the terrorist attacks in brussels. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. poe) that the house suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, h. res. 658. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",27454

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 653, I call up the bill (H.R. 2745) to amend the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act to provide that the Federal Trade Commission shall exercise authority with respect to mergers only under the Clayton Act and only in the same procedural manner as the Attorney General exercises such authority, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 653, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2745 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE CLAYTON ACT. The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended-- (1) by striking section 4F and inserting the following: ``SEC. 4F.

(3) A case in which a preliminary injunction has been filed in a district court of the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. General Leave Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2745, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act, marking the beginning of a dual antitrust enforcement regime in the United States. Because both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission enforce our Nation's antitrust laws, companies may and often do have different experiences when interacting with one agency relative to the other. One area in which the disparity can be the most striking and troubling is in the merger review process. When a company wishes to merge with or purchase another company, it must notify both antitrust enforcement agencies of the proposed transaction. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission then determine which agency will be responsible for reviewing the transaction. As there are no fixed rules for making this determination, it can appear that the decision is made on the basis of a flip of the coin. There are two substantive differences that companies face based on the identity of the antitrust enforcement agency that reviews the company's proposed transaction. The first difference arises if the agency seeks to prevent the transaction by pursuing a preliminary injunction in Federal court. A different legal standard is applied to a preliminary injunction request based solely on the identity of the requesting antitrust enforcement agency. The second difference lies in the process available to each antitrust enforcement agency to prevent a transaction from proceeding. The FTC may pursue administrative litigation against a proposed transaction even after a court denies its preliminary injunction request. In contrast, the Department of Justice cannot pursue administrative litigation. There is no justification for these disparities in the merger review processes and standards. The bipartisan Antitrust Modernization Commission recommended that Congress remove these disparities, and the bill before us today, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, or SMARTER Act, does just that. I applaud Mr. Farenthold of Texas for introducing this important legislation that will enhance the transparency, predictability, and credibility of the antitrust merger review process. By enacting the SMARTER Act into law, Congress will ensure that companies no longer will be subjected to fundamentally different processes and standards based on the flip of a coin. Notably, the legislation has garnered the support of former and current FTC Commissioners, including former Chairman David Clanton, former Commissioner Josh Wright, and sitting Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen. The SMARTER Act is an important step toward ensuring that our Nation's antitrust laws are enforced in a manner that is fair, consistent, and predictable. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this good government bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called SMARTER Act, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, which really should--I mean, it is a misnomer. We should rename this bill. Instead of that, we should rename it the Sadly More Acronyms for Really Terrible and Esoteric Requirements Act. {time} 0945 I know a lot of people around the country are wondering: Well, what is this all about? It must be important that they are doing this. I will tell you what is important about it. It is a piece of legislation that would impact the largest and most consequential of corporate mergers, of multinational corporate mergers. Those things have to go through a review process with our Federal Trade Commission. Also, the Department of Justice has an antitrust division. What this piece of legislation would do would be to gut one of the agency's--the FTC's--ability to oversee and deal with merger review issues that affect the largest and most consequential of their mergers, of these big corporate mergers. Does this piece of legislation benefit the people? Or does it benefit the 1 percent of large multinational corporations that, I guess, need help avoiding regulatory authority by our government? Well, it looks like that is what it is. It is something that is going to help out big business at a time when people in this country are very angry about the fact that the playing field is not level. The corporations and the wealthy have been doing pretty well over the last couple of generations, but people are seeing their wages stand right there where they were. They are working harder, they are more productive, but yet they can't even take a vacation. They can't even afford to take a day off to see about a sick child. This is why people are so angry. It is because they look at Congress and they see us doing this kind of work benefiting 1 percent of the largest multinational corporations when there are other things like passing a budget, dealing with the Zika crisis which is unfolding, dealing with the Flint water crisis, dealing with the opioid addiction crisis in this country. We can't even pass a budget. Here we are going to pass the so-called SMARTER Act today, and then we are going to go home for almost 3 weeks. They call it a district work period, but it is actually a period where folks are out campaigning, trying to retain their seats. People are angry about that. Congress first established the Federal Trade Commission in 1914 to safeguard consumers against anticompetitive behavior by empowering the Commission with the authority to enforce, clarify, and develop antitrust law. President Woodrow Wilson later described the creation of the Commission as specifically providing for tribunals that would ``determine what was fair and what was unfair competition; and to supply the business community not merely with lawyers in the Department of Justice who could cry, `Stop!', but [[Page H1562]] with men in such tribunals as the Federal Trade Commission who could say, `Go on,' who could warn where things were going wrong and assist instead of check.'' Today, under the process of administrative litigation, also known as part 3 litigation, the Commission does just that. Under this authority, it may seek permanent injunctions in its own administrative court in addition to its ability to seek preliminary injunctions in Federal District Court. This authority is a unique mechanism that takes advantage of the Commission's longstanding expertise to develop some of the most complex issues in antitrust law. But the SMARTER Act would upend this century of precedent and expertise by creating a uniform standard for preliminary injunctions in cases involving significant mergers and other transactions and, alarmingly, eliminating the Commission's ability to administratively litigate antitrust cases. Proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that divergent standards for enjoining mergers may undermine the public's trust in the efficient and fair outcome of merger cases. They also state that the outcome of a transaction comes down to a coin flip between the agencies to determine which will review a transaction. That claim is ridiculous and it is not borne out by the evidence. The American Antitrust Institute, a consumer-oriented antitrust organization, conducted a lengthy study of workload statistics compiled by both antitrust agencies and found that the concerns of the bill's sponsors are without foundation. Jonathan Jacobson, a leading antitrust attorney who served on the Antitrust Modernization Commission, testified that in his 39 years of practice, the outcome of a merger has never turned on the differences that the SMARTER Act seeks to address in antitrust law. Indeed, of the 3 percent of transactions requiring second requests for information from the antitrust agencies, only about 1.5 percent of those cases are stopped or modified. An even smaller percentage of these cases go to trial for an administrative hearing. We should hesitate before making wholesale changes to the law based on theoretical concerns involving about 1 percent of mergers, which also happen to be some of the largest and most consequential. In the absence of any meaningful evidence suggesting a material difference in the enforcement of the antitrust laws, it is difficult to upending longstanding antitrust practices at the FTC for consistency's sake alone based on speculative harms. But even assuming that there are material differences in cases brought under these standards, we should strike a balance in favor of competition by lowering the burden of proof in cases brought by the Justice Department, not by raising the Commission's burden for obtaining preliminary injunctions. Courts already require a lower burden of proof in cases brought by the Commission and Justice Department precisely because both are expert agencies equipped with large staffs of economists who analyze numerous mergers on a regular basis and who may only bring cases that are in the public interest. To the extent that we should address perceived differences in the standard for preliminary injunctions in merger cases, legislation should favor increased competition, not the interests of merging parties. The SMARTER Act would eliminate the FTC's authority to administratively litigate mergers and other transactions under section 5(b) of the FTC Act. Leading authorities in antitrust across party lines have expressed serious reservations with eliminating the Commission's administrative litigation authority. For instance, Bill Kovacic, a former Republican chair of the Commission, has referred to this aspect of the bill as ``rubbish,'' noting that the Commission has used administrative litigation to win a string of novel antitrust cases that courts have ultimately upheld where the ``Commission has had to fight for every single foot along the way.'' Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the FTC, likewise wrote last Congress that eliminating the FTC's administrative litigation authority would ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the FTC.'' Mr. Speaker, 2015 was the year of the merger, megamergers, mergermania. There was over $3.8 trillion in merger spending, a record that far exceeded expectations. While fewer than 20 percent of mergers raise competition concerns, it is clear that a vote for H.R. 2745 is a vote for concentrated, private economic power. At a time of increased consolidation in key industries, we can't afford more Republican attacks on government, which is what H.R. 2745 is, plain and simple. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold), a member of the Judiciary Committee, and the vice chair of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to be here today to be the sponsor of the SMARTER Act. This is just good government. We have a situation now that if you want to merge your company with another company, you could go before the Federal Trade Commission or you could go before the Department of Justice. Now, you would think that the Clayton Act that governs antitrust law would say: All right. Well, we are going to get treated the same, no matter which way we go, the law is the law. But that is not how it works. A big piece of this is the procedural aspect of it. If your merger is reviewed by the Department of Justice and they have a problem with it and they need a preliminarily injunction to stop it, they go to Federal Court before a judge, as the Founding Fathers intended, the executive branch agency, and there is a dispute, and it is litigated in front of a Federal court. But if you go before the Federal Trade Commission, they could go to Federal court like the Department of Justice, but they can also go to their own court. They have got their own court with an FTC employee as the judge. Now, we have got administrative law courts that work, but they can also do both. You have got a situation that the merger could be delayed. In these business transactions, as in life, time is money. Just the threat of going through this administrative process has the effect of giving the FTC the ability to extract concessions that the DOJ wouldn't. Look, we need to be treated fairly no matter which agency reviews it. This is the main gist of the SMARTER Act. Let's make it the same if you go to the DOJ or the FTC. This isn't just something that we, Republicans, pulled out of our hats. This is a recommendation from the bipartisan Antitrust Modification Commission. They have testified that this is part of what they think needs to be done to make a better, more efficient government. Listen, nobody wants to be tied up in red tape. As you go through a merger and you draw the short straw and end up in front of the FTC, you have got another spool of red tape that you could very possibly get rolled up in. I don't think that is fair and I don't think the American people think that is fair. Now, my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), says this guts the antitrust laws. It doesn't. It just makes them fairer. It makes the review the same no matter where you go. It is commonsense, good government. I don't have anything else to say. I don't see how you can be against fairness. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the Honorable Bill Pascrell from New Jersey, who serves on, by the way, the Budget and the Ways and Means Committees here in Congress, I would like to point out that we have got a severe problem that we are confronting this morning. It is the big, bad FTC, which is treating the big multinational corporations unfairly. It is abusing them, and something needs to be done. The American people are demanding it. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) so that he can explain further how important this bill is to the American people. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. [[Page H1563]] This bill is terrible. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with protecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. What I just heard from the gentleman is that this is all about getting rid of red tape. Baloney. This is about money, this is about keeping money in your own pocket and protecting yourself against the consumers. {time} 1000 Concessions we are talking about here. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with protecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. That is what the job is. Corporate mergers can make industries more efficient and bring benefits to customers, but in some cases, they have the potential to increase costs and hurt competition. Mr. Speaker, if you deny that, then you don't have the facts, and I am going to lay them out right now. Government should not be in the business of setting prices for healthcare services or anything else for that matter--for airline tickets, cable Internet services, or anything else. I hope we agree on that. That is why we need to rely on robust market competition--to keep the prices of goods and services down and ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal. I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, with due respect, that we are pretty good fans of competition; yet here we are, after Bloomberg dubbed 2015 the ``Year of the Mergers,'' weakening a key FTC tool to ensure healthy competition in a variety of markets. Mr. Speaker, I have been particularly concerned with this issue, and I mentioned four areas here. I am very, very concerned about the mergers we have seen in many sectors of the healthcare industry. Read my lips: look at the facts through the Speaker. In my left hand, a recent report by the Health Care Pricing Project, which was written up in The New York Times late last year, found that monopoly hospitals have prices that are 15.3 percent higher than hospitals in an area with four or more hospitals--even after controlling for costs in each area. Don't you really believe in competition, or do you just say that? Is that simply a bumper sticker, a slogan, or do you mean that? Two pending mergers in the insurance industry, between Anthem and Cigna and Aetna and Humana, set the stage for major consolidation in this industry as well. In other words, what this report did was establish the fact--I hope you are interested in the facts--that the reason we have increasing healthcare costs--a major reason--is for the merger and the reduction in competition in health care. Then there are the mergers that are motivated by U.S. tax dodging, Mr. Speaker, and we have talked about this, which have major implications on competition but also on the United States tax base. One pending merger would see a major United States company slash its United States tax bill by moving its headquarters overseas and creating the largest drug company in the universe. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I yield the gentleman an additional 1\1/2\ minutes. Mr. PASCRELL. Working Americans across the country do not have the benefit of hiring consultants, of shifting their earned income around the globe to find the lowest tax rate. And you are standing there, saying you want to help the consumer? It is just the opposite. Many multinational corporations do just that. Corporate inversions allow companies to renege on the obligation to America, eroding the United States tax base and hurting American competitiveness. Who are you with anyway? If you live in a neighborhood and one house--let's say the biggest house on the block--doesn't pay its property taxes, what happens? Everyone understands that the rest of the houses on the block have to make up the difference. The Treasury has taken steps to address inversions, but it is up to Congress to pass legislation that addresses this problem immediately. In the meantime, the bill before us today would weaken the FTC's ability to monitor and enforce against unfair, anticompetitive mergers, and they are all over the place. I blame, partially, the administration, as the former Attorney General did nothing about mergers. While people were trying to get him to resign for other reasons, that would have been a darned good reason. This is not Republican or Democrat, my friends. These are simply the facts, and I can tell you this one report will very, very much crystallize what those facts are. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey's commitment to the free market, because I think we all believe a free and fair market is in the best interest of America and in the best interest of every American consumer, but we have got to take a look at the procedure. This is, primarily, procedural in nature so that those companies that are seeking mergers, whether they go through the FTC or through the Department of Justice, are simply treated the same. If the gentleman is concerned about the fact that there are too many mergers--that we are getting bigger and bigger companies and that it is stifling competition--that is a legitimate conversation for us to have in the context of changing the law with respect to monopolies, mergers, and acquisitions. What we are trying to do here is not change that law, but make that law fairer and applied equally, regardless of whether one is in front of the Department of Justice or whether one is in front of the Federal Trade Commission. If the gentleman takes that argument, then he is saying, right now, the FTC has an advantage in stopping these mergers because it has all of these other procedures in place, as opposed to the Department of Justice. Why should one get stuck with a tougher row to hoe based on which agency one goes in front of? That is just not fair. Mr. PASCRELL. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. FARENTHOLD. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, what we need to understand is that we are not only talking about the FTC, we are talking about the Justice Department, which oversees these mergers regardless of whether we are talking about health or airlines, which is a catastrophe. I only brought up health care today. We are having that discussion you just talked about. Mr. FARENTHOLD. In reclaiming my time, I think the gentleman has a problem with the fact that there are so many mergers and that he thinks it is anticompetitive and not good for folks. That is an opinion that the gentleman is, certainly, entitled to, but that is, I think, out of the scope of what this bill is trying to do. Mr. Speaker, this bill takes existing law and says, look, let's apply it the same regardless of which agency one is before. I think that is the difference there. I would be happy to meet with the gentleman in his office and see if we can find some ways that we can agree so that we might reform the overall antitrust system. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I am mainly concerned about this piece of legislation because you have determined--you have defined--a nonexistent problem while applying a less consumer friendly standard. That is my position. What I brought up here is part of the mix. It is putting it in context as to what has happened. The consequences of what has happened are higher prices for us--for you and me--and I know you are concerned about that. Mr. FARENTHOLD. In reclaiming my time, my point is that, if the gentleman thinks we have too many mergers, let's change the law, but let's have a fair procedure. What this bill is designed to do is to have a fair procedure for those who are engaged in that activity. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my friend from Texas. We went through a period of time in the first decade of this century of U.S. [[Page H1564]] prosecutors and attorneys looking at the subject of deferred prosecutions. I am talking about justice here. That is the bottom line. That is what we are talking about here. Instead of bringing corporations to trial that had violated the law-- and I am not an attorney. I am not the reason for two of my sons being attorneys, but I am not an attorney--they worked out a proposition. This is what they are trying to do, and this is what this is all about, if I could draw a comparison, which is you slap a corporation on the wrist, it pays a fine, and the fine becomes the cost of doing business. Mr. Speaker, this is going in the wrong direction. It is attacking a problem that does not exist instead of attacking a problem that does exist. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am anguished in listening to the pleas of my friend from Texas to help these megamergers, to help these big, multinational corporations. They need us so badly because the big, bad FTC is treating them too tough. It is too rough on them. Therefore, we have to make the law fairer for them. They have all of these silk stocking lawyers off of Wall Street, but we need to help them. We are not doing anything else here in Congress other than helping multinational corporations, hearing the plea that these folks need help when it is the folks in Flint, Michigan, who need help, who are crying out for help, but their voices can't be heard in this Congress because we are too busy trying to protect these big, multinational corporations. The only thing we want to do, according to my friends, is to harmonize the standard of proof between the DOJ and the FTC so that the big, bad corporations which need our help only have to deal with one standard of proof. They are not telling you what they are really wanting to do, which is to gut administrative review by the FTC, under section 5(b) of the FTC Act. That is where the real harm comes in, but they don't want to tell you about that. They don't want to let you know what kind of impact that has when a prescription drug company seeks to merge again with another large company and make a humongous company that is too big to fail and, also, too big to regulate your drug prices out there. Why are your drug prices going up? What kind of policies are we implementing here in Congress to protect them? Absolutely none. We are making it easier for prices to go up with insurance, in the travel industry, in trying to get a hotel. In trying to book a hotel room on the Internet, they have got it all rigged up because there are only a couple of companies you can go through to get the room. These are the policies that are affecting the lives of the people whom we represent. I don't represent many big, multinational corporations. I don't think I have any, as a matter of fact, in my district, but I guess there are some folks around here who have a bunch of them. {time} 1015 Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 10 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, since I have one speaker remaining, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, and I thank the chairman of the full committee and the author of this bill. I rise in combination of speaking on this bill, but also offering my deepest sympathy to the people of Brussels, the people of Belgium which, some would say, is the heart of the civic participation of Europe--they are certainly dear friends of the United States--though we would mourn any who have been impacted by the dastardly deeds of terrorism. I know in our committee, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Goodlatte are working on these issues. I would hope that we could move the no fly for foreign terrorists bill as quickly as possible as we make our way through these issues of determining how we disrupt the ideology and then the actions that result in the deaths of innocent persons. So I offer that. Mr. Speaker, I am struck by the name of this bill because I don't know who gets smarter. I know that the consumers get poorer and that there are opportunities for victimizing the consumers. This bill does not create equal rules or implement smarter legislation. But if I might take up the comment about the increasing cost of prescription drugs, that is clearly a result of not allowing the FTC to pursue and to proceed because it is our arm of equalizing and balancing the consumer. On this day, when we acknowledge the sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act that has brought health insurance to 20 million people, we know that what we need to fix is the rising cost of prescription drugs. So this bill is about attacking the administrative authority of the Federal Trade Commission. It is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally undermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and ability to prevent anticompetitive mergers. As a law student, I remember in my antitrust classes how the FTC was highlighted as one of the anchors of balance and the anchors of protection of innocent civilians. Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of power by eliminating the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger cases and by blocking its ability to use its administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction. Why is that? The FTC is where you can engage and have discussion. The bill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same enforcement process as the DOJ. There is more ability for the little guy to be heard at the FTC. This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and effectively removes a very core and functioning character of the agency, lets more people in the door to express themselves for or against this merger, how it impacts, with less resources needed to get in front of an administrative agency than dealing with the Department of Justice. Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with Congress' intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and policymaking body as a distinct and independent shield from political and executive interference. As enforcers of section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and DOJ have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and acquisitions that substantially lessen competition. That saves money because competition helps save money. These agencies serve to complement each other. Why make them the same? They are not twins. Based upon historical experience and coordinated development, the FTC serves to protect consumers and consumer spending, health care, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, food safety, among other things. The DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on larger corporate industries, like telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, they work together. Don't take away the consumers' arm. That is the FTC. This bill takes it away and puts the little guy under and the big guy up. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2745, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews through Equal Rules Act--otherwise known as the SMARTER Act. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about creating equal rules or implementing ``smarter'' legislation. Rather, it is about attacking the administrative authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). H.R. 2745 is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally undermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and ability to prevent anti-competitive mergers. As we all know, the FTC was created by Congress with the specific intent of creating an independent antitrust enforcement agency and supplemental authority to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of its power by eliminating [[Page H1565]] the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger cases, and by blocking its ability to use its administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction. The bill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same enforcement process as the DOJ. This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and effectively removes the very core and functioning character of this agency. Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with Congress's intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and policymaking body as distinct and independent shield from political and executive interference. As enforcers of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and the DOJ have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and acquisitions that would ``substantially lessen competition'' or ``tend to create a monopoly''. Under this enforcement authority, these agencies serve to complement each other, and have developed over the years to specialize in particular industries and markets. Based upon historical experience and coordinated developments, the FTC serves to protect consumers and consumer spending--e.g., healthcare, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, and certain high-tech industries like computer technology and internet services. Whereas, the DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on larger corporate industries--e.g., telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. Thus, while the FTC and the DOJ have operated with a shared responsibility of enforcing federal antitrust laws, these two federal agencies are unique and each retain exclusive authority of certain conduct. Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, the FTC and DOJ rely upon each other to coordinate agency jurisdiction and harmonized standards and practices. The SMARTER Act is simply unnecessary as it fails to put forth any meaningful effort to enhance or rectify any expressed concerns governing these longstanding agency operations. In particular, in 2002 Congress sought to review and amend antitrust laws and policies in light of changing economy and rise in technological advances. In 2007 a report issued by the Antitrust Modernization Commission (AMC) set forth specific recommendations for the FTC to eliminate real or perceived disparities in the review process for merger transactions. According to the AMC, Congress should seek to ensure that the same or comparable standard is used when seeking a preliminary injunction against a potentially anticompetitive transaction. However, the SMARTER Act goes beyond this recommendation and seeks to chip away and carve out the entire administrative adjudication authority of the FTC. In order to identify potential violations of the Clayton Act, the FTC and the DOJ review proposed merger transactions pursuant to the Hart- Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the HSR Act), which provides advance notice and sets forth guidelines on large merger and acquisition transactions. The heart of this concern is the alternate means in which the FTC and the DOJ carry out their enforcement role during this HSR pre-merger process. Namely, H.R. 2745 is curiously motivated by the preliminary injunction process utilized by the FTC and the DOJ to halt proposed transactions that would violate the Clayton Act if completed. Additionally, the DOJ typically consolidates the preliminary and permanent injunction proceedings, while the FTC typically only pursues the preliminary injunction. While some argue that proposed transactions reviewed through the FTC would be treated more leniently than those reviewed through the DOJ, this assertion was not fully substantiated by the AMC. The pre-merger review process and the injunction standards utilized by the FTC and the DOJ are the very procedural steps that characterize and distinguish the respective enforcement roles of these agencies. This supposed area of concern addresses only a small fraction of proposed transactions, as the vast majority of merger and acquisition proposals are found to not be in violation of the Clayton Act during the review process. The FTC and the DOJ review over a thousand merger filings every year. Yet 95% of those merger filings present no competitive issues or challenged transactions. As reported by the American Antitrust Institute (AAI), the overall concerns purported by the bill's sponsors are simply without foundation. In contrast, the overall work of the FTC has an incredible impact on American consumers, communities and corporations and will be severely impacted if disrupted. As highlighted by the FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in her testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, the FTC prioritizes the protection of consumers and the prevention of anticompetitive market practices. In fact, the FTC exists to ensure fair competition and to prevent enormous concentrations of economic power that hurts consumers and small businesses. For example: In the past year, the FTC has challenged over 28 mergers, (although in most it was able to negotiate a remedy to allow the merger to proceed). At the consumer level in my home state of Texas, the FTC secured an $82,000 settlement against an auto-dealer found in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in September 2015. Also last year, the FTC ordered the largest divestiture ever in a supermarket merger, requiring Albertsons and Safeway to sell 168 supermarkets in 130 local markets throughout several states, ensuring that communities continue to benefit from competition among their local supermarkets. The FTC has also taken an aggressive stance on stopping anticompetitive mergers and conduct in the healthcare market by halting such practices through administrative litigation. In September 2015, the FTC secured a $1.1 million settlement to consumers who lost money to a health insurance telemarketing scam. And in the last two years, the FTC took action in 13 pharmaceutical mergers, ordering divestitures to preserve competition for drugs that treat diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, as well as widely used generic medications like oral contraceptives and antibiotics. Just last week on March 18, 2016, after a thoroughly vetted investigation, the FTC approved a final order preserving competition among outpatient dialysis clinics in Laredo, Texas. That is, the FTC cleared U.S. Renal Care, Inc.'s (the country's third largest outpatient dialysis provider) $640 million purchase of dialysis competitor DSI Renal, on the condition that three of DSI's outpatient clinics in Laredo, Texas, be handed over to a third party. Absent this agreed divestiture, the acquisition would have led to a significant increase in market concentration and anti-competitive effects. The likely result, according to the FTC, would have included the elimination of direct competition between U.S. Renal Care and DSI Renal, reduced incentives to improve services or quality for dialysis patients, and increased ability for the merged company to unilaterally increase prices. Notably, the DOJ has also been successful in securing investigations and halting suspected harmful merger practices on a much larger scale (in the health care and airline industry as of recent). In June 2015, the DOJ put pressure on several multibillion dollar health insurers seeking to engage in large merger transactions with near certain suppression of market competition in the healthcare industry. In August 2015, the DOJ issued civil investigative demands on several major US airlines seeking to halt any potential unlawful mergers. These cases demonstrate the need for continued protection of the FTC and its ability to effectively carry out injunctions on harmful merger and acquisition activities, as well as anticompetitive business conduct that harms consumers and restrains market activity. The ability of the FTC to function independently is a necessary function to the success of both the FTC and the DOJ. The far-reaching and elusive SMARTER Act fails keep the foundational integrity of these agencies and should be opposed. I urge all Members to vote against this serious threat to our fundamental protections of consumers and fair economic competition. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. It is not often that I come to the floor to argue a bill and to debate and nobody on the other side shows up to participate in the debate. I have been feeling kind of lonely over here. I guess that people are too embarrassed on the other side to come here and defend this legislation at this particular time, as we get ready to depart for what will be just about 3 weeks, while we are leaving dangling and hanging important issues, like a budget for this country that was promised to us back at the beginning of the year. It was supposed to be regular order. It was supposed to be that we are going to do a budget. After the budget is done and we have our top lines and bottom lines in place, then we will embark upon the appropriations process and we will pass all of [[Page H1566]] the 12 appropriations bills for the first time in years and we will get back to regular order around here. They can't even produce enough votes to pass a budget. So what do we do then? We revert to trying to protect and coddle and make things easy for big multinational corporations that want to get bigger. They want to get bigger so that they can get a lock on the market, they have no competition, and then they can set whatever price they want to set and the American people are left having to pay. What can you do when you need your prescription medication and there is no competition, no other similar drug, and you only have one player in the room; therefore, you have to pay whatever they are holding you over the barrel for. The American people are sick and tired and they are angry about having been held over a barrel year after year after year as this Congress continues to coddle and protect and make things good for big business. Well, what about the working people of this country? When are we going to do something about making sure that they don't have to pay these increased bills that they would have to pay for things like hotel rooms, insurance, medical care, prescription drugs, nursing homes, and food? I don't even want to talk about the price of gas that is going to go up this summer. Despite the fact that we have a glut in the oil market, you are going to be seeing your gas prices rise. Why? Because you are getting out on the road and trying to go on vacation. It is getting more and more difficult to do that because wages haven't gone up. So this Congress continues to make it easy for big corporations to increase their profits while doing nothing to raise wages for the regular working people of this country. Now we are getting ready to go on another 3-week district work period. I have a lot of work to do in the district trying to explain to the people of my district why we are not getting down to business and doing the things that they expect this Congress to do. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues in this body oppose the SMARTER Act and do what is right for the American people. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Let's look at the arguments, the straw men that have been set up by the other party claiming that this legislation does a manner of things that it simply does not do. First, they say enacting the SMARTER Act only benefits large companies that wish to merge, but the SMARTER Act protects small and midsize companies which also come under the Federal Trade Commission's scrutiny. This legislation is not designed to help big companies get bigger. Indeed, large companies have the resources to hire the lawyers, economists, lobbyists, and other regulatory professionals to wrestle with the FTC. It is the small- and medium-size companies that would benefit from a fair process and an assurance that they would have their day in court. The FTC does not always focus its attention on the large companies. In fact, a Wall Street Journal article from 2013 documents how the FTC pursued anticompetitive practices of the Music Teachers National Association, a nonprofit with about a dozen employees. In short, this nonprofit was a collection of piano teachers. So if you think the FTC only engages with conglomerates, you are mistaken. They will even prosecute your after-school piano teacher. The SMARTER Act ensures that, if the FTC does focus its efforts on piano teachers, on the small- and medium-size companies, they will have the benefit of a fair process. Then they make the argument that the SMARTER Act will make it more difficult for antitrust enforcement agencies to stop a merger, but the SMARTER Act only changes the process. It does not have any substantive impact on merger reviews. The SMARTER Act does not make any substantive changes to antitrust law. Rather, the legislation only standardizes the process between the two antitrust enforcement agencies. The witnesses at the committee hearings on the SMARTER Act testified that the legislation only affects the process and not the substantive standard. As Deborah Garza, former chairwoman of the Antitrust Modernization Commission stated: No one on the AMC believed at the time, and I do not believe today, that this legislation would make it difficult or impossible for the FTC Commission to do its job. The Justice Department has done very well in pursuing its merger enforcement agenda working with the standards that apply to it. And I firmly believe that the FTC can do so as well. Indeed, even the current Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General for the antitrust division stated: I do not think there is a practical difference in how the courts assess the factual and legal basis for enjoining a merger challenged by the FTC on the one hand and the Department on the other. Let me also quote from a letter written by 15 leading antitrust professors who wrote to Congress expressing their support for the SMARTER Act: The FTC is a very impressive agency that plays a valuable role in antitrust enforcement. The SMARTER Act does nothing to undermine the FTC's authority. It simply ensures that the merger review processes and standards are equally applied to merger parties, regardless of which agency reviews the transaction. The gentleman from New Jersey complained about what was going on with the review of proposed mergers by health insurance companies. Guess what. Who is doing those reviews? Not the FTC. The Department of Justice. It doesn't make any sense. What does make sense is that there are lots of companies going through lots of things caused, in part, by ObamaCare forcing healthcare providers, insurance companies, and others to look at mergers and acquisitions. When they do so, the public should have the right to know that justice is being done. This is not about big business or small business. This is about making sure that the laws are fairly and equally applied. When that happens, we should have this legislation at hand so that we have the assurance that we are going to have justice done. The FTC should operate by the same merger review processes and standards that the Department of Justice does. I believe in the vigorous prosecution of antitrust practices and transactions by the Department of Justice and the FTC. I would not support the SMARTER Act if I thought that it would disadvantage our antitrust enforcement agencies. The Congressional Record demonstrates that the SMARTER Act only makes the process more fair and predictable while providing the antitrust enforcement agencies with the same powers to prosecute antitrust practices. {time} 1030 The SMARTER Act is a commonsense process reform that ensures fairness and parity in the narrow field of merger reviews. The bill was recommended to Congress by a bipartisan commission and is supported by former top Department of Justice antitrust enforcement officials and past and present FTC Commissioners of both political parties. This legislation will help America continue to serve as a leader and innovator in competition law, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2745, the ``Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015'' or SMARTER Act, would require the Federal Trade Commission to use the same merger enforcement procedures as the Justice Department's Antitrust Division for proposed mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and other similar transactions. I oppose this flawed bill for several reasons. Most importantly, H.R. 2745--by weakening the Commission's independence--undermines Congress's original intent in creating the Federal Trade Commission in the first place. For good reasons that are still relevant today, Congress established the Commission to be an independent administrative agency. Although the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 empowered the Justice Department to enforce antitrust laws, Congress determined that more needed to be done to address the wave of mergers and anti-competitive corporate abuses that continued notwithstanding the enactment of that Act. [[Page H1567]] Accordingly, Congress created the Commission in 1914 as an independent body of experts charged with developing antitrust law and policy free from political influence, and particularly executive branch interference. To this end, Congress specifically gave the Commission broad administrative powers to investigate and enforce laws to stop unfair methods of competition as well as the authority to use an administrative adjudication process to develop policy expertise, rather than requiring the Commission to try cases before a generalist federal judge. Yet, rather than strengthening the Commission's independence and enforcement authority, the SMARTER Act does the opposite. Of greatest concern is the bill's elimination of the administrative adjudication process for merger cases under section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. By doing so, the SMARTER Act would effectively transform the Commission from an independent administrative agency into just another competition enforcement agency indistinguishable from the Justice Department and, thereby, arguable redundant. The Commission's administrative authority is key to its distinctive role as an independent administrative agency. But the SMARTER Act--by eliminating the Commission's administrative authority--opens the door for the ultimate elimination of the Commission. And, you do not just have to take my word for it. Former Republican Commission Chairman William Kovacic, while expressing support for the bill's harmonization of preliminary injunction standards, says that the ``rest of the SMARTER Act is rubbish.'' He continued, ``Let me put it this way: behind the rest of [the SMARTER Act] is the fundamental question of whether you want the Federal Trade Commission involved in competition law.'' Similarly, current Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez observes that the bill would have ``far-reaching immediate effects'' and ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the Commission, as well as the potential for significant unintended consequences.'' Consumers Union also opposes the SMARTER Act not only because it is completely unnecessary, but also because the bill could ``create unintended hurdles to effective and sound enforcement'' and ``set the stage for further tinkering--both of which risk undermining what is now a coherent, consistent, well-established, familiar enforcement procedure within the'' Commission. Finally, the SMARTER Act is problematic because it may apply to conduct well-beyond large mergers, which could further hinder the Commission's effectiveness. In particular, the SMARTER Act would eliminate the Commission's authority to use administrative adjudications not just for the largest mergers, but for non-merger activity, like a ``joint venture'' or ``similar transaction.'' I recognize that the bill's authors have tried in good faith to respond to some of the concerns expressed by me and by the Commission during the last Congress and I appreciate those efforts. Moreover, I recognize that the Commission itself last year changed its procedural rules to make it easier to end the use of administrative litigation where it loses a preliminary injunction proceeding in court. I continue to have concerns, however, about the bill's prohibition against the Commission's administrative litigation authority with respect to all merger cases. Accordingly, I must oppose the SMARTER Act, even in its rewritten form, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to H.R. 2745. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 653, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. DOGGETT. I am. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Doggett moves to recommit the bill (H.R. 2745) to the Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report the bill back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At the end of the bill, add the following: SEC. 5. PROTECTING CONSUMERS AGAINST HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. (a) This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs. (b) The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.12 et seq.) and Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 et seq.) as in effect immediately before the date of the enactment of this Act shall apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for many months now so many of us Democrats here in the House have been pleading with our Republican colleagues to recognize that there is a very serious cost to the American people of prescription price gouging; such a serious matter that, overwhelmingly, in the fall, when the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed healthcare concerns of Americans, the number one issue was soaring, unaffordable prescription drugs. We have not been very successful in getting their attention on this just to recognize the severity of the problem--not even getting to the point of agreeing on what legislative action this Congress, this administration might take in order to address this problem. We got another indication of the severity of the problem and the way that people across America are being impacted by the Republican failure to address prescription price gouging in the latest survey done this year by AARP, their RxPrice Watch report, which found the average retail price among 622 prescription medicines that are widely used by seniors more than doubled from less than $6,000 in 2006 to over $11,000 in 2013. That is an incredible increase. It is not just seniors who are impacted, but working families, people all over the United States, by the fact that prescription drug prices are rising much faster than the cost of living and other health care. Now, we have been asking for months that Republicans recognize the severity of this problem. I have asked in the Committee on Ways and Means. We cannot even get a hearing on the subject. Our colleagues have asked, in the Commerce Committee, how about a hearing to look at what is happening to the American people on these outrageous prescription price increases that just keep increasing and increasing? The Commerce Committee has refused to hold a hearing on it. The Committee on Appropriations has been asked to review and consider this problem. They won't hold a hearing on it. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, under the leadership of Elijah Cummings as the ranking Democrat, asked for a subpoena. Finally--and it is appropriate for this bill, they call it the SMARTER Act, and Republicans are always so much better at naming their legislation than what is in it--we had a smart aleck who got subpoenaed, the guy who thought it was okay to raise the price of an over 60-year-old drug by over 5,000 percent in 1 day, having a big impact on people who needed it for reduced immunity from any number of kinds of treatments, a 5,000 percent increase, and they at least were willing to get him over video to make his various smart-aleck remarks about his ability to do that. Competition by itself is not solving the problem with the soaring cost of prescription drugs. But trying to maintain competition, if Republicans won't recognize how endangered so many Americans are by prescription price gouging, we ought not to go backwards, and that is what I fear this bill would do. Let me give you a precise example. On November 18, the Federal Trade Commission, which would be impacted by this bill, approved a final order that was concerned with the merger on generic drugs that treat certain types of ulcers and thyroid conditions. This is the merger, an $8 billion merger between Endo International and Par Pharmaceuticals. The FTC was concerned about the effect on competition and raising prices and gouging consumers even more than is occurring already. I do not want to impair in any way their ability to initiate litigation, to be involved, to see that competition remains--to the limited extent it is now--and not see seniors or working families with a sick child or anyone who gets a sad diagnosis of a life-threatening disease and then finds themselves facing financial ruin even if they have insurance, to see [[Page H1568]] one of the few tools we have to deal with these anticompetitive provisions eliminated by this bill. This is the last amendment on the bill. It will not send the bill back to committee. It will at least preserve this one narrow area. If Republicans won't recognize the problem, at least don't go make it worse. They could be bringing up bills to this floor like the one that had bipartisan support about 8 or 9 years ago. Former Representative John Dingell had a bill so that we would begin to have Medicare negotiate prices with these pharmaceutical companies. Twenty-four Republicans even joined us. That is the kind of bipartisan action we need. At least approve this motion to recommit. Let the bill move forward, but without gouging consumers on prescription drug prices even more than they are today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that, because of ObamaCare and government regulation, the cost of prescription drugs is going up--and going up too fast. We definitely need to reform our healthcare system, starting with repealing ObamaCare and putting in place real patient-centered reforms to our healthcare system, but that is not what this legislation is about today. The SMARTER Act is predicated on a very simple notion: the results of an antitrust merger review should not be dependent on which antitrust enforcement agency happens to review the deal. The outcome should not be determined by the flip of an agency coin. The SMARTER Act is a process reform that ensures that all parties have their day in court and are subject to the same standards, regardless of which antitrust enforcement agency reviews their merger. The motion to recommit defeats this simple reform by carving out an exception for one area. Why, if we are seeking justice, why, if we are seeking a fair standard for all people before these antitrust review agencies, would we take this particular area and say, no, we are not going to have a consistent standard for reviewing something that the gentleman feels is so important. We all feel that is very important, and that is why we all should oppose this motion to recommit and vote for the underlying bill. I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and the motion to suspend the rules and agree to House Resolution 658. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 174, nays 235, not voting 24, as follows: [Roll No. 136] YEAS--174 Adams Aguilar Beatty Becerra Beyer Bishop (GA) Bonamici Brady (PA) Brownley (CA) Bustos Butterfield Capps Capuano Cardenas Carney Carson (IN) Cartwright Castor (FL) Castro (TX) Chu, Judy Cicilline Clark (MA) Clarke (NY) Clay Cleaver Clyburn Cohen Connolly Conyers Cooper Costa Courtney Crowley Cuellar Cummings Davis (CA) Davis, Danny DeFazio DeGette Delaney DeLauro DelBene DeSaulnier Deutch Dingell Doggett Doyle, Michael F.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 653, I call up the bill (H.R. 2745) to amend the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act to provide that the Federal Trade Commission shall exercise authority with respect to mergers only under the Clayton Act and only in the same procedural manner as the Attorney General exercises such authority, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 653, the bill is considered read. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2745 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE CLAYTON ACT. The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended-- (1) by striking section 4F and inserting the following: ``SEC. 4F.

The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. General Leave Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2745, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act, marking the beginning of a dual antitrust enforcement regime in the United States. Because both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission enforce our Nation's antitrust laws, companies may and often do have different experiences when interacting with one agency relative to the other. One area in which the disparity can be the most striking and troubling is in the merger review process. When a company wishes to merge with or purchase another company, it must notify both antitrust enforcement agencies of the proposed transaction. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission then determine which agency will be responsible for reviewing the transaction. As there are no fixed rules for making this determination, it can appear that the decision is made on the basis of a flip of the coin. There are two substantive differences that companies face based on the identity of the antitrust enforcement agency that reviews the company's proposed transaction. The first difference arises if the agency seeks to prevent the transaction by pursuing a preliminary injunction in Federal court. A different legal standard is applied to a preliminary injunction request based solely on the identity of the requesting antitrust enforcement agency. The second difference lies in the process available to each antitrust enforcement agency to prevent a transaction from proceeding. The FTC may pursue administrative litigation against a proposed transaction even after a court denies its preliminary injunction request. In contrast, the Department of Justice cannot pursue administrative litigation. There is no justification for these disparities in the merger review processes and standards. The bipartisan Antitrust Modernization Commission recommended that Congress remove these disparities, and the bill before us today, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, or SMARTER Act, does just that. I applaud Mr. Farenthold of Texas for introducing this important legislation that will enhance the transparency, predictability, and credibility of the antitrust merger review process. By enacting the SMARTER Act into law, Congress will ensure that companies no longer will be subjected to fundamentally different processes and standards based on the flip of a coin. Notably, the legislation has garnered the support of former and current FTC Commissioners, including former Chairman David Clanton, former Commissioner Josh Wright, and sitting Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen. The SMARTER Act is an important step toward ensuring that our Nation's antitrust laws are enforced in a manner that is fair, consistent, and predictable. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this good government bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called SMARTER Act, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, which really should--I mean, it is a misnomer. We should rename this bill. Instead of that, we should rename it the Sadly More Acronyms for Really Terrible and Esoteric Requirements Act. {time} 0945 I know a lot of people around the country are wondering: Well, what is this all about? It must be important that they are doing this. I will tell you what is important about it. It is a piece of legislation that would impact the largest and most consequential of corporate mergers, of multinational corporate mergers. Those things have to go through a review process with our Federal Trade Commission. Also, the Department of Justice has an antitrust division. What this piece of legislation would do would be to gut one of the agency's--the FTC's--ability to oversee and deal with merger review issues that affect the largest and most consequential of their mergers, of these big corporate mergers. Does this piece of legislation benefit the people? Or does it benefit the 1 percent of large multinational corporations that, I guess, need help avoiding regulatory authority by our government? Well, it looks like that is what it is. It is something that is going to help out big business at a time when people in this country are very angry about the fact that the playing field is not level. The corporations and the wealthy have been doing pretty well over the last couple of generations, but people are seeing their wages stand right there where they were. They are working harder, they are more productive, but yet they can't even take a vacation. They can't even afford to take a day off to see about a sick child. This is why people are so angry. It is because they look at Congress and they see us doing this kind of work benefiting 1 percent of the largest multinational corporations when there are other things like passing a budget, dealing with the Zika crisis which is unfolding, dealing with the Flint water crisis, dealing with the opioid addiction crisis in this country. We can't even pass a budget. Here we are going to pass the so-called SMARTER Act today, and then we are going to go home for almost 3 weeks. They call it a district work period, but it is actually a period where folks are out campaigning, trying to retain their seats. People are angry about that. Congress first established the Federal Trade Commission in 1914 to safeguard consumers against anticompetitive behavior by empowering the Commission with the authority to enforce, clarify, and develop antitrust law. President Woodrow Wilson later described the creation of the Commission as specifically providing for tribunals that would ``determine what was fair and what was unfair competition; and to supply the business community not merely with lawyers in the Department of Justice who could cry, `Stop!', but [[Page H1562]] with men in such tribunals as the Federal Trade Commission who could say, `Go on,' who could warn where things were going wrong and assist instead of check.'' Today, under the process of administrative litigation, also known as part 3 litigation, the Commission does just that. Under this authority, it may seek permanent injunctions in its own administrative court in addition to its ability to seek preliminary injunctions in Federal District Court. This authority is a unique mechanism that takes advantage of the Commission's longstanding expertise to develop some of the most complex issues in antitrust law. But the SMARTER Act would upend this century of precedent and expertise by creating a uniform standard for preliminary injunctions in cases involving significant mergers and other transactions and, alarmingly, eliminating the Commission's ability to administratively litigate antitrust cases. Proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that divergent standards for enjoining mergers may undermine the public's trust in the efficient and fair outcome of merger cases. They also state that the outcome of a transaction comes down to a coin flip between the agencies to determine which will review a transaction. That claim is ridiculous and it is not borne out by the evidence. The American Antitrust Institute, a consumer-oriented antitrust organization, conducted a lengthy study of workload statistics compiled by both antitrust agencies and found that the concerns of the bill's sponsors are without foundation. Jonathan Jacobson, a leading antitrust attorney who served on the Antitrust Modernization Commission, testified that in his 39 years of practice, the outcome of a merger has never turned on the differences that the SMARTER Act seeks to address in antitrust law. Indeed, of the 3 percent of transactions requiring second requests for information from the antitrust agencies, only about 1.5 percent of those cases are stopped or modified. An even smaller percentage of these cases go to trial for an administrative hearing. We should hesitate before making wholesale changes to the law based on theoretical concerns involving about 1 percent of mergers, which also happen to be some of the largest and most consequential. In the absence of any meaningful evidence suggesting a material difference in the enforcement of the antitrust laws, it is difficult to upending longstanding antitrust practices at the FTC for consistency's sake alone based on speculative harms. But even assuming that there are material differences in cases brought under these standards, we should strike a balance in favor of competition by lowering the burden of proof in cases brought by the Justice Department, not by raising the Commission's burden for obtaining preliminary injunctions. Courts already require a lower burden of proof in cases brought by the Commission and Justice Department precisely because both are expert agencies equipped with large staffs of economists who analyze numerous mergers on a regular basis and who may only bring cases that are in the public interest. To the extent that we should address perceived differences in the standard for preliminary injunctions in merger cases, legislation should favor increased competition, not the interests of merging parties. The SMARTER Act would eliminate the FTC's authority to administratively litigate mergers and other transactions under section 5(b) of the FTC Act. Leading authorities in antitrust across party lines have expressed serious reservations with eliminating the Commission's administrative litigation authority. For instance, Bill Kovacic, a former Republican chair of the Commission, has referred to this aspect of the bill as ``rubbish,'' noting that the Commission has used administrative litigation to win a string of novel antitrust cases that courts have ultimately upheld where the ``Commission has had to fight for every single foot along the way.'' Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the FTC, likewise wrote last Congress that eliminating the FTC's administrative litigation authority would ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the FTC.'' Mr. Speaker, 2015 was the year of the merger, megamergers, mergermania. There was over $3.8 trillion in merger spending, a record that far exceeded expectations. While fewer than 20 percent of mergers raise competition concerns, it is clear that a vote for H.R. 2745 is a vote for concentrated, private economic power. At a time of increased consolidation in key industries, we can't afford more Republican attacks on government, which is what H.R. 2745 is, plain and simple. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold), a member of the Judiciary Committee, and the vice chair of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to be here today to be the sponsor of the SMARTER Act. This is just good government. We have a situation now that if you want to merge your company with another company, you could go before the Federal Trade Commission or you could go before the Department of Justice. Now, you would think that the Clayton Act that governs antitrust law would say: All right. Well, we are going to get treated the same, no matter which way we go, the law is the law. But that is not how it works. A big piece of this is the procedural aspect of it. If your merger is reviewed by the Department of Justice and they have a problem with it and they need a preliminarily injunction to stop it, they go to Federal Court before a judge, as the Founding Fathers intended, the executive branch agency, and there is a dispute, and it is litigated in front of a Federal court. But if you go before the Federal Trade Commission, they could go to Federal court like the Department of Justice, but they can also go to their own court. They have got their own court with an FTC employee as the judge. Now, we have got administrative law courts that work, but they can also do both. You have got a situation that the merger could be delayed. In these business transactions, as in life, time is money. Just the threat of going through this administrative process has the effect of giving the FTC the ability to extract concessions that the DOJ wouldn't. Look, we need to be treated fairly no matter which agency reviews it. This is the main gist of the SMARTER Act. Let's make it the same if you go to the DOJ or the FTC. This isn't just something that we, Republicans, pulled out of our hats. This is a recommendation from the bipartisan Antitrust Modification Commission. They have testified that this is part of what they think needs to be done to make a better, more efficient government. Listen, nobody wants to be tied up in red tape. As you go through a merger and you draw the short straw and end up in front of the FTC, you have got another spool of red tape that you could very possibly get rolled up in. I don't think that is fair and I don't think the American people think that is fair. Now, my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), says this guts the antitrust laws. It doesn't. It just makes them fairer. It makes the review the same no matter where you go. It is commonsense, good government. I don't have anything else to say. I don't see how you can be against fairness. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the Honorable Bill Pascrell from New Jersey, who serves on, by the way, the Budget and the Ways and Means Committees here in Congress, I would like to point out that we have got a severe problem that we are confronting this morning. It is the big, bad FTC, which is treating the big multinational corporations unfairly. It is abusing them, and something needs to be done. The American people are demanding it. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) so that he can explain further how important this bill is to the American people. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. [[Page H1563]] This bill is terrible. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with protecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. What I just heard from the gentleman is that this is all about getting rid of red tape. Baloney. This is about money, this is about keeping money in your own pocket and protecting yourself against the consumers. {time} 1000 Concessions we are talking about here. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with protecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. That is what the job is. Corporate mergers can make industries more efficient and bring benefits to customers, but in some cases, they have the potential to increase costs and hurt competition. Mr. Speaker, if you deny that, then you don't have the facts, and I am going to lay them out right now. Government should not be in the business of setting prices for healthcare services or anything else for that matter--for airline tickets, cable Internet services, or anything else. I hope we agree on that. That is why we need to rely on robust market competition--to keep the prices of goods and services down and ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal. I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, with due respect, that we are pretty good fans of competition; yet here we are, after Bloomberg dubbed 2015 the ``Year of the Mergers,'' weakening a key FTC tool to ensure healthy competition in a variety of markets. Mr. Speaker, I have been particularly concerned with this issue, and I mentioned four areas here. I am very, very concerned about the mergers we have seen in many sectors of the healthcare industry. Read my lips: look at the facts through the Speaker. In my left hand, a recent report by the Health Care Pricing Project, which was written up in The New York Times late last year, found that monopoly hospitals have prices that are 15.3 percent higher than hospitals in an area with four or more hospitals--even after controlling for costs in each area. Don't you really believe in competition, or do you just say that? Is that simply a bumper sticker, a slogan, or do you mean that? Two pending mergers in the insurance industry, between Anthem and Cigna and Aetna and Humana, set the stage for major consolidation in this industry as well. In other words, what this report did was establish the fact--I hope you are interested in the facts--that the reason we have increasing healthcare costs--a major reason--is for the merger and the reduction in competition in health care. Then there are the mergers that are motivated by U.S. tax dodging, Mr. Speaker, and we have talked about this, which have major implications on competition but also on the United States tax base. One pending merger would see a major United States company slash its United States tax bill by moving its headquarters overseas and creating the largest drug company in the universe. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I yield the gentleman an additional 1\1/2\ minutes. Mr. PASCRELL. Working Americans across the country do not have the benefit of hiring consultants, of shifting their earned income around the globe to find the lowest tax rate. And you are standing there, saying you want to help the consumer? It is just the opposite. Many multinational corporations do just that. Corporate inversions allow companies to renege on the obligation to America, eroding the United States tax base and hurting American competitiveness. Who are you with anyway? If you live in a neighborhood and one house--let's say the biggest house on the block--doesn't pay its property taxes, what happens? Everyone understands that the rest of the houses on the block have to make up the difference. The Treasury has taken steps to address inversions, but it is up to Congress to pass legislation that addresses this problem immediately. In the meantime, the bill before us today would weaken the FTC's ability to monitor and enforce against unfair, anticompetitive mergers, and they are all over the place. I blame, partially, the administration, as the former Attorney General did nothing about mergers. While people were trying to get him to resign for other reasons, that would have been a darned good reason. This is not Republican or Democrat, my friends. These are simply the facts, and I can tell you this one report will very, very much crystallize what those facts are. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey's commitment to the free market, because I think we all believe a free and fair market is in the best interest of America and in the best interest of every American consumer, but we have got to take a look at the procedure. This is, primarily, procedural in nature so that those companies that are seeking mergers, whether they go through the FTC or through the Department of Justice, are simply treated the same. If the gentleman is concerned about the fact that there are too many mergers--that we are getting bigger and bigger companies and that it is stifling competition--that is a legitimate conversation for us to have in the context of changing the law with respect to monopolies, mergers, and acquisitions. What we are trying to do here is not change that law, but make that law fairer and applied equally, regardless of whether one is in front of the Department of Justice or whether one is in front of the Federal Trade Commission. If the gentleman takes that argument, then he is saying, right now, the FTC has an advantage in stopping these mergers because it has all of these other procedures in place, as opposed to the Department of Justice. Why should one get stuck with a tougher row to hoe based on which agency one goes in front of? That is just not fair. Mr. PASCRELL. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. FARENTHOLD. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, what we need to understand is that we are not only talking about the FTC, we are talking about the Justice Department, which oversees these mergers regardless of whether we are talking about health or airlines, which is a catastrophe. I only brought up health care today. We are having that discussion you just talked about. Mr. FARENTHOLD. In reclaiming my time, I think the gentleman has a problem with the fact that there are so many mergers and that he thinks it is anticompetitive and not good for folks. That is an opinion that the gentleman is, certainly, entitled to, but that is, I think, out of the scope of what this bill is trying to do. Mr. Speaker, this bill takes existing law and says, look, let's apply it the same regardless of which agency one is before. I think that is the difference there. I would be happy to meet with the gentleman in his office and see if we can find some ways that we can agree so that we might reform the overall antitrust system. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I am mainly concerned about this piece of legislation because you have determined--you have defined--a nonexistent problem while applying a less consumer friendly standard. That is my position. What I brought up here is part of the mix. It is putting it in context as to what has happened. The consequences of what has happened are higher prices for us--for you and me--and I know you are concerned about that. Mr. FARENTHOLD. In reclaiming my time, my point is that, if the gentleman thinks we have too many mergers, let's change the law, but let's have a fair procedure. What this bill is designed to do is to have a fair procedure for those who are engaged in that activity. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my friend from Texas. We went through a period of time in the first decade of this century of U.S. [[Page H1564]] prosecutors and attorneys looking at the subject of deferred prosecutions. I am talking about justice here. That is the bottom line. That is what we are talking about here. Instead of bringing corporations to trial that had violated the law-- and I am not an attorney. I am not the reason for two of my sons being attorneys, but I am not an attorney--they worked out a proposition. This is what they are trying to do, and this is what this is all about, if I could draw a comparison, which is you slap a corporation on the wrist, it pays a fine, and the fine becomes the cost of doing business. Mr. Speaker, this is going in the wrong direction. It is attacking a problem that does not exist instead of attacking a problem that does exist. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am anguished in listening to the pleas of my friend from Texas to help these megamergers, to help these big, multinational corporations. They need us so badly because the big, bad FTC is treating them too tough. It is too rough on them. Therefore, we have to make the law fairer for them. They have all of these silk stocking lawyers off of Wall Street, but we need to help them. We are not doing anything else here in Congress other than helping multinational corporations, hearing the plea that these folks need help when it is the folks in Flint, Michigan, who need help, who are crying out for help, but their voices can't be heard in this Congress because we are too busy trying to protect these big, multinational corporations. The only thing we want to do, according to my friends, is to harmonize the standard of proof between the DOJ and the FTC so that the big, bad corporations which need our help only have to deal with one standard of proof. They are not telling you what they are really wanting to do, which is to gut administrative review by the FTC, under section 5(b) of the FTC Act. That is where the real harm comes in, but they don't want to tell you about that. They don't want to let you know what kind of impact that has when a prescription drug company seeks to merge again with another large company and make a humongous company that is too big to fail and, also, too big to regulate your drug prices out there. Why are your drug prices going up? What kind of policies are we implementing here in Congress to protect them? Absolutely none. We are making it easier for prices to go up with insurance, in the travel industry, in trying to get a hotel. In trying to book a hotel room on the Internet, they have got it all rigged up because there are only a couple of companies you can go through to get the room. These are the policies that are affecting the lives of the people whom we represent. I don't represent many big, multinational corporations. I don't think I have any, as a matter of fact, in my district, but I guess there are some folks around here who have a bunch of them. {time} 1015 Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 10 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, since I have one speaker remaining, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, and I thank the chairman of the full committee and the author of this bill. I rise in combination of speaking on this bill, but also offering my deepest sympathy to the people of Brussels, the people of Belgium which, some would say, is the heart of the civic participation of Europe--they are certainly dear friends of the United States--though we would mourn any who have been impacted by the dastardly deeds of terrorism. I know in our committee, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Goodlatte are working on these issues. I would hope that we could move the no fly for foreign terrorists bill as quickly as possible as we make our way through these issues of determining how we disrupt the ideology and then the actions that result in the deaths of innocent persons. So I offer that. Mr. Speaker, I am struck by the name of this bill because I don't know who gets smarter. I know that the consumers get poorer and that there are opportunities for victimizing the consumers. This bill does not create equal rules or implement smarter legislation. But if I might take up the comment about the increasing cost of prescription drugs, that is clearly a result of not allowing the FTC to pursue and to proceed because it is our arm of equalizing and balancing the consumer. On this day, when we acknowledge the sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act that has brought health insurance to 20 million people, we know that what we need to fix is the rising cost of prescription drugs. So this bill is about attacking the administrative authority of the Federal Trade Commission. It is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally undermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and ability to prevent anticompetitive mergers. As a law student, I remember in my antitrust classes how the FTC was highlighted as one of the anchors of balance and the anchors of protection of innocent civilians. Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of power by eliminating the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger cases and by blocking its ability to use its administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction. Why is that? The FTC is where you can engage and have discussion. The bill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same enforcement process as the DOJ. There is more ability for the little guy to be heard at the FTC. This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and effectively removes a very core and functioning character of the agency, lets more people in the door to express themselves for or against this merger, how it impacts, with less resources needed to get in front of an administrative agency than dealing with the Department of Justice. Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with Congress' intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and policymaking body as a distinct and independent shield from political and executive interference. As enforcers of section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and DOJ have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and acquisitions that substantially lessen competition. That saves money because competition helps save money. These agencies serve to complement each other. Why make them the same? They are not twins. Based upon historical experience and coordinated development, the FTC serves to protect consumers and consumer spending, health care, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, food safety, among other things. The DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on larger corporate industries, like telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, they work together. Don't take away the consumers' arm. That is the FTC. This bill takes it away and puts the little guy under and the big guy up. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2745, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews through Equal Rules Act--otherwise known as the SMARTER Act. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about creating equal rules or implementing ``smarter'' legislation. Rather, it is about attacking the administrative authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). H.R. 2745 is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally undermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and ability to prevent anti-competitive mergers. As we all know, the FTC was created by Congress with the specific intent of creating an independent antitrust enforcement agency and supplemental authority to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of its power by eliminating [[Page H1565]] the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger cases, and by blocking its ability to use its administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction. The bill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same enforcement process as the DOJ. This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and effectively removes the very core and functioning character of this agency. Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with Congress's intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and policymaking body as distinct and independent shield from political and executive interference. As enforcers of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and the DOJ have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and acquisitions that would ``substantially lessen competition'' or ``tend to create a monopoly''. Under this enforcement authority, these agencies serve to complement each other, and have developed over the years to specialize in particular industries and markets. Based upon historical experience and coordinated developments, the FTC serves to protect consumers and consumer spending--e.g., healthcare, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, and certain high-tech industries like computer technology and internet services. Whereas, the DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on larger corporate industries--e.g., telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. Thus, while the FTC and the DOJ have operated with a shared responsibility of enforcing federal antitrust laws, these two federal agencies are unique and each retain exclusive authority of certain conduct. Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, the FTC and DOJ rely upon each other to coordinate agency jurisdiction and harmonized standards and practices. The SMARTER Act is simply unnecessary as it fails to put forth any meaningful effort to enhance or rectify any expressed concerns governing these longstanding agency operations. In particular, in 2002 Congress sought to review and amend antitrust laws and policies in light of changing economy and rise in technological advances. In 2007 a report issued by the Antitrust Modernization Commission (AMC) set forth specific recommendations for the FTC to eliminate real or perceived disparities in the review process for merger transactions. According to the AMC, Congress should seek to ensure that the same or comparable standard is used when seeking a preliminary injunction against a potentially anticompetitive transaction. However, the SMARTER Act goes beyond this recommendation and seeks to chip away and carve out the entire administrative adjudication authority of the FTC. In order to identify potential violations of the Clayton Act, the FTC and the DOJ review proposed merger transactions pursuant to the Hart- Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the HSR Act), which provides advance notice and sets forth guidelines on large merger and acquisition transactions. The heart of this concern is the alternate means in which the FTC and the DOJ carry out their enforcement role during this HSR pre-merger process. Namely, H.R. 2745 is curiously motivated by the preliminary injunction process utilized by the FTC and the DOJ to halt proposed transactions that would violate the Clayton Act if completed. Additionally, the DOJ typically consolidates the preliminary and permanent injunction proceedings, while the FTC typically only pursues the preliminary injunction. While some argue that proposed transactions reviewed through the FTC would be treated more leniently than those reviewed through the DOJ, this assertion was not fully substantiated by the AMC. The pre-merger review process and the injunction standards utilized by the FTC and the DOJ are the very procedural steps that characterize and distinguish the respective enforcement roles of these agencies. This supposed area of concern addresses only a small fraction of proposed transactions, as the vast majority of merger and acquisition proposals are found to not be in violation of the Clayton Act during the review process. The FTC and the DOJ review over a thousand merger filings every year. Yet 95% of those merger filings present no competitive issues or challenged transactions. As reported by the American Antitrust Institute (AAI), the overall concerns purported by the bill's sponsors are simply without foundation. In contrast, the overall work of the FTC has an incredible impact on American consumers, communities and corporations and will be severely impacted if disrupted. As highlighted by the FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in her testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, the FTC prioritizes the protection of consumers and the prevention of anticompetitive market practices. In fact, the FTC exists to ensure fair competition and to prevent enormous concentrations of economic power that hurts consumers and small businesses. For example: In the past year, the FTC has challenged over 28 mergers, (although in most it was able to negotiate a remedy to allow the merger to proceed). At the consumer level in my home state of Texas, the FTC secured an $82,000 settlement against an auto-dealer found in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in September 2015. Also last year, the FTC ordered the largest divestiture ever in a supermarket merger, requiring Albertsons and Safeway to sell 168 supermarkets in 130 local markets throughout several states, ensuring that communities continue to benefit from competition among their local supermarkets. The FTC has also taken an aggressive stance on stopping anticompetitive mergers and conduct in the healthcare market by halting such practices through administrative litigation. In September 2015, the FTC secured a $1.1 million settlement to consumers who lost money to a health insurance telemarketing scam. And in the last two years, the FTC took action in 13 pharmaceutical mergers, ordering divestitures to preserve competition for drugs that treat diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, as well as widely used generic medications like oral contraceptives and antibiotics. Just last week on March 18, 2016, after a thoroughly vetted investigation, the FTC approved a final order preserving competition among outpatient dialysis clinics in Laredo, Texas. That is, the FTC cleared U.S. Renal Care, Inc.'s (the country's third largest outpatient dialysis provider) $640 million purchase of dialysis competitor DSI Renal, on the condition that three of DSI's outpatient clinics in Laredo, Texas, be handed over to a third party. Absent this agreed divestiture, the acquisition would have led to a significant increase in market concentration and anti-competitive effects. The likely result, according to the FTC, would have included the elimination of direct competition between U.S. Renal Care and DSI Renal, reduced incentives to improve services or quality for dialysis patients, and increased ability for the merged company to unilaterally increase prices. Notably, the DOJ has also been successful in securing investigations and halting suspected harmful merger practices on a much larger scale (in the health care and airline industry as of recent). In June 2015, the DOJ put pressure on several multibillion dollar health insurers seeking to engage in large merger transactions with near certain suppression of market competition in the healthcare industry. In August 2015, the DOJ issued civil investigative demands on several major US airlines seeking to halt any potential unlawful mergers. These cases demonstrate the need for continued protection of the FTC and its ability to effectively carry out injunctions on harmful merger and acquisition activities, as well as anticompetitive business conduct that harms consumers and restrains market activity. The ability of the FTC to function independently is a necessary function to the success of both the FTC and the DOJ. The far-reaching and elusive SMARTER Act fails keep the foundational integrity of these agencies and should be opposed. I urge all Members to vote against this serious threat to our fundamental protections of consumers and fair economic competition. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. It is not often that I come to the floor to argue a bill and to debate and nobody on the other side shows up to participate in the debate. I have been feeling kind of lonely over here. I guess that people are too embarrassed on the other side to come here and defend this legislation at this particular time, as we get ready to depart for what will be just about 3 weeks, while we are leaving dangling and hanging important issues, like a budget for this country that was promised to us back at the beginning of the year. It was supposed to be regular order. It was supposed to be that we are going to do a budget. After the budget is done and we have our top lines and bottom lines in place, then we will embark upon the appropriations process and we will pass all of [[Page H1566]] the 12 appropriations bills for the first time in years and we will get back to regular order around here. They can't even produce enough votes to pass a budget. So what do we do then? We revert to trying to protect and coddle and make things easy for big multinational corporations that want to get bigger. They want to get bigger so that they can get a lock on the market, they have no competition, and then they can set whatever price they want to set and the American people are left having to pay. What can you do when you need your prescription medication and there is no competition, no other similar drug, and you only have one player in the room; therefore, you have to pay whatever they are holding you over the barrel for. The American people are sick and tired and they are angry about having been held over a barrel year after year after year as this Congress continues to coddle and protect and make things good for big business. Well, what about the working people of this country? When are we going to do something about making sure that they don't have to pay these increased bills that they would have to pay for things like hotel rooms, insurance, medical care, prescription drugs, nursing homes, and food? I don't even want to talk about the price of gas that is going to go up this summer. Despite the fact that we have a glut in the oil market, you are going to be seeing your gas prices rise. Why? Because you are getting out on the road and trying to go on vacation. It is getting more and more difficult to do that because wages haven't gone up. So this Congress continues to make it easy for big corporations to increase their profits while doing nothing to raise wages for the regular working people of this country. Now we are getting ready to go on another 3-week district work period. I have a lot of work to do in the district trying to explain to the people of my district why we are not getting down to business and doing the things that they expect this Congress to do. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues in this body oppose the SMARTER Act and do what is right for the American people. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Let's look at the arguments, the straw men that have been set up by the other party claiming that this legislation does a manner of things that it simply does not do. First, they say enacting the SMARTER Act only benefits large companies that wish to merge, but the SMARTER Act protects small and midsize companies which also come under the Federal Trade Commission's scrutiny. This legislation is not designed to help big companies get bigger. Indeed, large companies have the resources to hire the lawyers, economists, lobbyists, and other regulatory professionals to wrestle with the FTC. It is the small- and medium-size companies that would benefit from a fair process and an assurance that they would have their day in court. The FTC does not always focus its attention on the large companies. In fact, a Wall Street Journal article from 2013 documents how the FTC pursued anticompetitive practices of the Music Teachers National Association, a nonprofit with about a dozen employees. In short, this nonprofit was a collection of piano teachers. So if you think the FTC only engages with conglomerates, you are mistaken. They will even prosecute your after-school piano teacher. The SMARTER Act ensures that, if the FTC does focus its efforts on piano teachers, on the small- and medium-size companies, they will have the benefit of a fair process. Then they make the argument that the SMARTER Act will make it more difficult for antitrust enforcement agencies to stop a merger, but the SMARTER Act only changes the process. It does not have any substantive impact on merger reviews. The SMARTER Act does not make any substantive changes to antitrust law. Rather, the legislation only standardizes the process between the two antitrust enforcement agencies. The witnesses at the committee hearings on the SMARTER Act testified that the legislation only affects the process and not the substantive standard. As Deborah Garza, former chairwoman of the Antitrust Modernization Commission stated: No one on the AMC believed at the time, and I do not believe today, that this legislation would make it difficult or impossible for the FTC Commission to do its job. The Justice Department has done very well in pursuing its merger enforcement agenda working with the standards that apply to it. And I firmly believe that the FTC can do so as well. Indeed, even the current Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General for the antitrust division stated: I do not think there is a practical difference in how the courts assess the factual and legal basis for enjoining a merger challenged by the FTC on the one hand and the Department on the other. Let me also quote from a letter written by 15 leading antitrust professors who wrote to Congress expressing their support for the SMARTER Act: The FTC is a very impressive agency that plays a valuable role in antitrust enforcement. The SMARTER Act does nothing to undermine the FTC's authority. It simply ensures that the merger review processes and standards are equally applied to merger parties, regardless of which agency reviews the transaction. The gentleman from New Jersey complained about what was going on with the review of proposed mergers by health insurance companies. Guess what. Who is doing those reviews? Not the FTC. The Department of Justice. It doesn't make any sense. What does make sense is that there are lots of companies going through lots of things caused, in part, by ObamaCare forcing healthcare providers, insurance companies, and others to look at mergers and acquisitions. When they do so, the public should have the right to know that justice is being done. This is not about big business or small business. This is about making sure that the laws are fairly and equally applied. When that happens, we should have this legislation at hand so that we have the assurance that we are going to have justice done. The FTC should operate by the same merger review processes and standards that the Department of Justice does. I believe in the vigorous prosecution of antitrust practices and transactions by the Department of Justice and the FTC. I would not support the SMARTER Act if I thought that it would disadvantage our antitrust enforcement agencies. The Congressional Record demonstrates that the SMARTER Act only makes the process more fair and predictable while providing the antitrust enforcement agencies with the same powers to prosecute antitrust practices. {time} 1030 The SMARTER Act is a commonsense process reform that ensures fairness and parity in the narrow field of merger reviews. The bill was recommended to Congress by a bipartisan commission and is supported by former top Department of Justice antitrust enforcement officials and past and present FTC Commissioners of both political parties. This legislation will help America continue to serve as a leader and innovator in competition law, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2745, the ``Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015'' or SMARTER Act, would require the Federal Trade Commission to use the same merger enforcement procedures as the Justice Department's Antitrust Division for proposed mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and other similar transactions. I oppose this flawed bill for several reasons. Most importantly, H.R. 2745--by weakening the Commission's independence--undermines Congress's original intent in creating the Federal Trade Commission in the first place. For good reasons that are still relevant today, Congress established the Commission to be an independent administrative agency. Although the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 empowered the Justice Department to enforce antitrust laws, Congress determined that more needed to be done to address the wave of mergers and anti-competitive corporate abuses that continued notwithstanding the enactment of that Act. [[Page H1567]] Accordingly, Congress created the Commission in 1914 as an independent body of experts charged with developing antitrust law and policy free from political influence, and particularly executive branch interference. To this end, Congress specifically gave the Commission broad administrative powers to investigate and enforce laws to stop unfair methods of competition as well as the authority to use an administrative adjudication process to develop policy expertise, rather than requiring the Commission to try cases before a generalist federal judge. Yet, rather than strengthening the Commission's independence and enforcement authority, the SMARTER Act does the opposite. Of greatest concern is the bill's elimination of the administrative adjudication process for merger cases under section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. By doing so, the SMARTER Act would effectively transform the Commission from an independent administrative agency into just another competition enforcement agency indistinguishable from the Justice Department and, thereby, arguable redundant. The Commission's administrative authority is key to its distinctive role as an independent administrative agency. But the SMARTER Act--by eliminating the Commission's administrative authority--opens the door for the ultimate elimination of the Commission. And, you do not just have to take my word for it. Former Republican Commission Chairman William Kovacic, while expressing support for the bill's harmonization of preliminary injunction standards, says that the ``rest of the SMARTER Act is rubbish.'' He continued, ``Let me put it this way: behind the rest of [the SMARTER Act] is the fundamental question of whether you want the Federal Trade Commission involved in competition law.'' Similarly, current Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez observes that the bill would have ``far-reaching immediate effects'' and ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the Commission, as well as the potential for significant unintended consequences.'' Consumers Union also opposes the SMARTER Act not only because it is completely unnecessary, but also because the bill could ``create unintended hurdles to effective and sound enforcement'' and ``set the stage for further tinkering--both of which risk undermining what is now a coherent, consistent, well-established, familiar enforcement procedure within the'' Commission. Finally, the SMARTER Act is problematic because it may apply to conduct well-beyond large mergers, which could further hinder the Commission's effectiveness. In particular, the SMARTER Act would eliminate the Commission's authority to use administrative adjudications not just for the largest mergers, but for non-merger activity, like a ``joint venture'' or ``similar transaction.'' I recognize that the bill's authors have tried in good faith to respond to some of the concerns expressed by me and by the Commission during the last Congress and I appreciate those efforts. Moreover, I recognize that the Commission itself last year changed its procedural rules to make it easier to end the use of administrative litigation where it loses a preliminary injunction proceeding in court. I continue to have concerns, however, about the bill's prohibition against the Commission's administrative litigation authority with respect to all merger cases. Accordingly, I must oppose the SMARTER Act, even in its rewritten form, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to H.R. 2745. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 653, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. DOGGETT. I am. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Doggett moves to recommit the bill (H.R. 2745) to the Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report the bill back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At the end of the bill, add the following: SEC. 5. PROTECTING CONSUMERS AGAINST HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. (a) This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs. (b) The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.12 et seq.) and Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 et seq.) as in effect immediately before the date of the enactment of this Act shall apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for many months now so many of us Democrats here in the House have been pleading with our Republican colleagues to recognize that there is a very serious cost to the American people of prescription price gouging; such a serious matter that, overwhelmingly, in the fall, when the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed healthcare concerns of Americans, the number one issue was soaring, unaffordable prescription drugs. We have not been very successful in getting their attention on this just to recognize the severity of the problem--not even getting to the point of agreeing on what legislative action this Congress, this administration might take in order to address this problem. We got another indication of the severity of the problem and the way that people across America are being impacted by the Republican failure to address prescription price gouging in the latest survey done this year by AARP, their RxPrice Watch report, which found the average retail price among 622 prescription medicines that are widely used by seniors more than doubled from less than $6,000 in 2006 to over $11,000 in 2013. That is an incredible increase. It is not just seniors who are impacted, but working families, people all over the United States, by the fact that prescription drug prices are rising much faster than the cost of living and other health care. Now, we have been asking for months that Republicans recognize the severity of this problem. I have asked in the Committee on Ways and Means. We cannot even get a hearing on the subject. Our colleagues have asked, in the Commerce Committee, how about a hearing to look at what is happening to the American people on these outrageous prescription price increases that just keep increasing and increasing? The Commerce Committee has refused to hold a hearing on it. The Committee on Appropriations has been asked to review and consider this problem. They won't hold a hearing on it. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, under the leadership of Elijah Cummings as the ranking Democrat, asked for a subpoena. Finally--and it is appropriate for this bill, they call it the SMARTER Act, and Republicans are always so much better at naming their legislation than what is in it--we had a smart aleck who got subpoenaed, the guy who thought it was okay to raise the price of an over 60-year-old drug by over 5,000 percent in 1 day, having a big impact on people who needed it for reduced immunity from any number of kinds of treatments, a 5,000 percent increase, and they at least were willing to get him over video to make his various smart-aleck remarks about his ability to do that. Competition by itself is not solving the problem with the soaring cost of prescription drugs. But trying to maintain competition, if Republicans won't recognize how endangered so many Americans are by prescription price gouging, we ought not to go backwards, and that is what I fear this bill would do. Let me give you a precise example. On November 18, the Federal Trade Commission, which would be impacted by this bill, approved a final order that was concerned with the merger on generic drugs that treat certain types of ulcers and thyroid conditions. This is the merger, an $8 billion merger between Endo International and Par Pharmaceuticals. The FTC was concerned about the effect on competition and raising prices and gouging consumers even more than is occurring already. I do not want to impair in any way their ability to initiate litigation, to be involved, to see that competition remains--to the limited extent it is now--and not see seniors or working families with a sick child or anyone who gets a sad diagnosis of a life-threatening disease and then finds themselves facing financial ruin even if they have insurance, to see [[Page H1568]] one of the few tools we have to deal with these anticompetitive provisions eliminated by this bill. This is the last amendment on the bill. It will not send the bill back to committee. It will at least preserve this one narrow area. If Republicans won't recognize the problem, at least don't go make it worse. They could be bringing up bills to this floor like the one that had bipartisan support about 8 or 9 years ago. Former Representative John Dingell had a bill so that we would begin to have Medicare negotiate prices with these pharmaceutical companies. Twenty-four Republicans even joined us. That is the kind of bipartisan action we need. At least approve this motion to recommit. Let the bill move forward, but without gouging consumers on prescription drug prices even more than they are today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that, because of ObamaCare and government regulation, the cost of prescription drugs is going up--and going up too fast. We definitely need to reform our healthcare system, starting with repealing ObamaCare and putting in place real patient-centered reforms to our healthcare system, but that is not what this legislation is about today. The SMARTER Act is predicated on a very simple notion: the results of an antitrust merger review should not be dependent on which antitrust enforcement agency happens to review the deal. The outcome should not be determined by the flip of an agency coin. The SMARTER Act is a process reform that ensures that all parties have their day in court and are subject to the same standards, regardless of which antitrust enforcement agency reviews their merger. The motion to recommit defeats this simple reform by carving out an exception for one area. Why, if we are seeking justice, why, if we are seeking a fair standard for all people before these antitrust review agencies, would we take this particular area and say, no, we are not going to have a consistent standard for reviewing something that the gentleman feels is so important. We all feel that is very important, and that is why we all should oppose this motion to recommit and vote for the underlying bill. I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and the motion to suspend the rules and agree to House Resolution 658. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 174, nays 235, not voting 24, as follows: [Roll No. 136] YEAS--174 Adams Aguilar Beatty Becerra Beyer Bishop (GA) Bonamici Brady (PA) Brownley (CA) Bustos Butterfield Capps Capuano Cardenas Carney Carson (IN) Cartwright Castor (FL) Castro (TX) Chu, Judy Cicilline Clark (MA) Clarke (NY) Clay Cleaver Clyburn Cohen Connolly Conyers Cooper Costa Courtney Crowley Cuellar Cummings Davis (CA) Davis, Danny DeFazio DeGette Delaney DeLauro DelBene DeSaulnier Deutch Dingell Doggett Doyle, Michael F.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2745, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act, marking the beginning of a dual antitrust enforcement regime in the United States. Because both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission enforce our Nation's antitrust laws, companies may and often do have different experiences when interacting with one agency relative to the other. One area in which the disparity can be the most striking and troubling is in the merger review process. When a company wishes to merge with or purchase another company, it must notify both antitrust enforcement agencies of the proposed transaction. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission then determine which agency will be responsible for reviewing the transaction. As there are no fixed rules for making this determination, it can appear that the decision is made on the basis of a flip of the coin. There are two substantive differences that companies face based on the identity of the antitrust enforcement agency that reviews the company's proposed transaction. The first difference arises if the agency seeks to prevent the transaction by pursuing a preliminary injunction in Federal court. A different legal standard is applied to a preliminary injunction request based solely on the identity of the requesting antitrust enforcement agency. The second difference lies in the process available to each antitrust enforcement agency to prevent a transaction from proceeding. The FTC may pursue administrative litigation against a proposed transaction even after a court denies its preliminary injunction request. In contrast, the Department of Justice cannot pursue administrative litigation. There is no justification for these disparities in the merger review processes and standards. The bipartisan Antitrust Modernization Commission recommended that Congress remove these disparities, and the bill before us today, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, or SMARTER Act, does just that. I applaud Mr. Farenthold of Texas for introducing this important legislation that will enhance the transparency, predictability, and credibility of the antitrust merger review process. By enacting the SMARTER Act into law, Congress will ensure that companies no longer will be subjected to fundamentally different processes and standards based on the flip of a coin. Notably, the legislation has garnered the support of former and current FTC Commissioners, including former Chairman David Clanton, former Commissioner Josh Wright, and sitting Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen. The SMARTER Act is an important step toward ensuring that our Nation's antitrust laws are enforced in a manner that is fair, consistent, and predictable. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this good government bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so-called SMARTER Act, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, which really should--I mean, it is a misnomer. We should rename this bill. Instead of that, we should rename it the Sadly More Acronyms for Really Terrible and Esoteric Requirements Act. {time} 0945 I know a lot of people around the country are wondering: Well, what is this all about? It must be important that they are doing this. I will tell you what is important about it. It is a piece of legislation that would impact the largest and most consequential of corporate mergers, of multinational corporate mergers. Those things have to go through a review process with our Federal Trade Commission. Also, the Department of Justice has an antitrust division. What this piece of legislation would do would be to gut one of the agency's--the FTC's--ability to oversee and deal with merger review issues that affect the largest and most consequential of their mergers, of these big corporate mergers. Does this piece of legislation benefit the people? Or does it benefit the 1 percent of large multinational corporations that, I guess, need help avoiding regulatory authority by our government? Well, it looks like that is what it is. It is something that is going to help out big business at a time when people in this country are very angry about the fact that the playing field is not level. The corporations and the wealthy have been doing pretty well over the last couple of generations, but people are seeing their wages stand right there where they were. They are working harder, they are more productive, but yet they can't even take a vacation. They can't even afford to take a day off to see about a sick child. This is why people are so angry. It is because they look at Congress and they see us doing this kind of work benefiting 1 percent of the largest multinational corporations when there are other things like passing a budget, dealing with the Zika crisis which is unfolding, dealing with the Flint water crisis, dealing with the opioid addiction crisis in this country. We can't even pass a budget. Here we are going to pass the so-called SMARTER Act today, and then we are going to go home for almost 3 weeks. They call it a district work period, but it is actually a period where folks are out campaigning, trying to retain their seats. People are angry about that. Congress first established the Federal Trade Commission in 1914 to safeguard consumers against anticompetitive behavior by empowering the Commission with the authority to enforce, clarify, and develop antitrust law. President Woodrow Wilson later described the creation of the Commission as specifically providing for tribunals that would ``determine what was fair and what was unfair competition; and to supply the business community not merely with lawyers in the Department of Justice who could cry, `Stop!', but [[Page H1562]] with men in such tribunals as the Federal Trade Commission who could say, `Go on,' who could warn where things were going wrong and assist instead of check.'' Today, under the process of administrative litigation, also known as part 3 litigation, the Commission does just that. Under this authority, it may seek permanent injunctions in its own administrative court in addition to its ability to seek preliminary injunctions in Federal District Court. This authority is a unique mechanism that takes advantage of the Commission's longstanding expertise to develop some of the most complex issues in antitrust law. But the SMARTER Act would upend this century of precedent and expertise by creating a uniform standard for preliminary injunctions in cases involving significant mergers and other transactions and, alarmingly, eliminating the Commission's ability to administratively litigate antitrust cases. Proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that divergent standards for enjoining mergers may undermine the public's trust in the efficient and fair outcome of merger cases. They also state that the outcome of a transaction comes down to a coin flip between the agencies to determine which will review a transaction. That claim is ridiculous and it is not borne out by the evidence. The American Antitrust Institute, a consumer-oriented antitrust organization, conducted a lengthy study of workload statistics compiled by both antitrust agencies and found that the concerns of the bill's sponsors are without foundation. Jonathan Jacobson, a leading antitrust attorney who served on the Antitrust Modernization Commission, testified that in his 39 years of practice, the outcome of a merger has never turned on the differences that the SMARTER Act seeks to address in antitrust law. Indeed, of the 3 percent of transactions requiring second requests for information from the antitrust agencies, only about 1.5 percent of those cases are stopped or modified. An even smaller percentage of these cases go to trial for an administrative hearing. We should hesitate before making wholesale changes to the law based on theoretical concerns involving about 1 percent of mergers, which also happen to be some of the largest and most consequential. In the absence of any meaningful evidence suggesting a material difference in the enforcement of the antitrust laws, it is difficult to upending longstanding antitrust practices at the FTC for consistency's sake alone based on speculative harms. But even assuming that there are material differences in cases brought under these standards, we should strike a balance in favor of competition by lowering the burden of proof in cases brought by the Justice Department, not by raising the Commission's burden for obtaining preliminary injunctions. Courts already require a lower burden of proof in cases brought by the Commission and Justice Department precisely because both are expert agencies equipped with large staffs of economists who analyze numerous mergers on a regular basis and who may only bring cases that are in the public interest. To the extent that we should address perceived differences in the standard for preliminary injunctions in merger cases, legislation should favor increased competition, not the interests of merging parties. The SMARTER Act would eliminate the FTC's authority to administratively litigate mergers and other transactions under section 5(b) of the FTC Act. Leading authorities in antitrust across party lines have expressed serious reservations with eliminating the Commission's administrative litigation authority. For instance, Bill Kovacic, a former Republican chair of the Commission, has referred to this aspect of the bill as ``rubbish,'' noting that the Commission has used administrative litigation to win a string of novel antitrust cases that courts have ultimately upheld where the ``Commission has had to fight for every single foot along the way.'' Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the FTC, likewise wrote last Congress that eliminating the FTC's administrative litigation authority would ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the FTC.'' Mr. Speaker, 2015 was the year of the merger, megamergers, mergermania. There was over $3.8 trillion in merger spending, a record that far exceeded expectations. While fewer than 20 percent of mergers raise competition concerns, it is clear that a vote for H.R. 2745 is a vote for concentrated, private economic power. At a time of increased consolidation in key industries, we can't afford more Republican attacks on government, which is what H.R. 2745 is, plain and simple. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold), a member of the Judiciary Committee, and the vice chair of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to be here today to be the sponsor of the SMARTER Act. This is just good government. We have a situation now that if you want to merge your company with another company, you could go before the Federal Trade Commission or you could go before the Department of Justice. Now, you would think that the Clayton Act that governs antitrust law would say: All right. Well, we are going to get treated the same, no matter which way we go, the law is the law. But that is not how it works. A big piece of this is the procedural aspect of it. If your merger is reviewed by the Department of Justice and they have a problem with it and they need a preliminarily injunction to stop it, they go to Federal Court before a judge, as the Founding Fathers intended, the executive branch agency, and there is a dispute, and it is litigated in front of a Federal court. But if you go before the Federal Trade Commission, they could go to Federal court like the Department of Justice, but they can also go to their own court. They have got their own court with an FTC employee as the judge. Now, we have got administrative law courts that work, but they can also do both. You have got a situation that the merger could be delayed. In these business transactions, as in life, time is money. Just the threat of going through this administrative process has the effect of giving the FTC the ability to extract concessions that the DOJ wouldn't. Look, we need to be treated fairly no matter which agency reviews it. This is the main gist of the SMARTER Act. Let's make it the same if you go to the DOJ or the FTC. This isn't just something that we, Republicans, pulled out of our hats. This is a recommendation from the bipartisan Antitrust Modification Commission. They have testified that this is part of what they think needs to be done to make a better, more efficient government. Listen, nobody wants to be tied up in red tape. As you go through a merger and you draw the short straw and end up in front of the FTC, you have got another spool of red tape that you could very possibly get rolled up in. I don't think that is fair and I don't think the American people think that is fair. Now, my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), says this guts the antitrust laws. It doesn't. It just makes them fairer. It makes the review the same no matter where you go. It is commonsense, good government. I don't have anything else to say. I don't see how you can be against fairness. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, before I recognize the Honorable Bill Pascrell from New Jersey, who serves on, by the way, the Budget and the Ways and Means Committees here in Congress, I would like to point out that we have got a severe problem that we are confronting this morning. It is the big, bad FTC, which is treating the big multinational corporations unfairly. It is abusing them, and something needs to be done. The American people are demanding it. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) so that he can explain further how important this bill is to the American people. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. [[Page H1563]] This bill is terrible. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with protecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. What I just heard from the gentleman is that this is all about getting rid of red tape. Baloney. This is about money, this is about keeping money in your own pocket and protecting yourself against the consumers. {time} 1000 Concessions we are talking about here. The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with protecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. That is what the job is. Corporate mergers can make industries more efficient and bring benefits to customers, but in some cases, they have the potential to increase costs and hurt competition. Mr. Speaker, if you deny that, then you don't have the facts, and I am going to lay them out right now. Government should not be in the business of setting prices for healthcare services or anything else for that matter--for airline tickets, cable Internet services, or anything else. I hope we agree on that. That is why we need to rely on robust market competition--to keep the prices of goods and services down and ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal. I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, with due respect, that we are pretty good fans of competition; yet here we are, after Bloomberg dubbed 2015 the ``Year of the Mergers,'' weakening a key FTC tool to ensure healthy competition in a variety of markets. Mr. Speaker, I have been particularly concerned with this issue, and I mentioned four areas here. I am very, very concerned about the mergers we have seen in many sectors of the healthcare industry. Read my lips: look at the facts through the Speaker. In my left hand, a recent report by the Health Care Pricing Project, which was written up in The New York Times late last year, found that monopoly hospitals have prices that are 15.3 percent higher than hospitals in an area with four or more hospitals--even after controlling for costs in each area. Don't you really believe in competition, or do you just say that? Is that simply a bumper sticker, a slogan, or do you mean that? Two pending mergers in the insurance industry, between Anthem and Cigna and Aetna and Humana, set the stage for major consolidation in this industry as well. In other words, what this report did was establish the fact--I hope you are interested in the facts--that the reason we have increasing healthcare costs--a major reason--is for the merger and the reduction in competition in health care. Then there are the mergers that are motivated by U.S. tax dodging, Mr. Speaker, and we have talked about this, which have major implications on competition but also on the United States tax base. One pending merger would see a major United States company slash its United States tax bill by moving its headquarters overseas and creating the largest drug company in the universe. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I yield the gentleman an additional 1\1/2\ minutes. Mr. PASCRELL. Working Americans across the country do not have the benefit of hiring consultants, of shifting their earned income around the globe to find the lowest tax rate. And you are standing there, saying you want to help the consumer? It is just the opposite. Many multinational corporations do just that. Corporate inversions allow companies to renege on the obligation to America, eroding the United States tax base and hurting American competitiveness. Who are you with anyway? If you live in a neighborhood and one house--let's say the biggest house on the block--doesn't pay its property taxes, what happens? Everyone understands that the rest of the houses on the block have to make up the difference. The Treasury has taken steps to address inversions, but it is up to Congress to pass legislation that addresses this problem immediately. In the meantime, the bill before us today would weaken the FTC's ability to monitor and enforce against unfair, anticompetitive mergers, and they are all over the place. I blame, partially, the administration, as the former Attorney General did nothing about mergers. While people were trying to get him to resign for other reasons, that would have been a darned good reason. This is not Republican or Democrat, my friends. These are simply the facts, and I can tell you this one report will very, very much crystallize what those facts are. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey's commitment to the free market, because I think we all believe a free and fair market is in the best interest of America and in the best interest of every American consumer, but we have got to take a look at the procedure. This is, primarily, procedural in nature so that those companies that are seeking mergers, whether they go through the FTC or through the Department of Justice, are simply treated the same. If the gentleman is concerned about the fact that there are too many mergers--that we are getting bigger and bigger companies and that it is stifling competition--that is a legitimate conversation for us to have in the context of changing the law with respect to monopolies, mergers, and acquisitions. What we are trying to do here is not change that law, but make that law fairer and applied equally, regardless of whether one is in front of the Department of Justice or whether one is in front of the Federal Trade Commission. If the gentleman takes that argument, then he is saying, right now, the FTC has an advantage in stopping these mergers because it has all of these other procedures in place, as opposed to the Department of Justice. Why should one get stuck with a tougher row to hoe based on which agency one goes in front of? That is just not fair. Mr. PASCRELL. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. FARENTHOLD. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, what we need to understand is that we are not only talking about the FTC, we are talking about the Justice Department, which oversees these mergers regardless of whether we are talking about health or airlines, which is a catastrophe. I only brought up health care today. We are having that discussion you just talked about. Mr. FARENTHOLD. In reclaiming my time, I think the gentleman has a problem with the fact that there are so many mergers and that he thinks it is anticompetitive and not good for folks. That is an opinion that the gentleman is, certainly, entitled to, but that is, I think, out of the scope of what this bill is trying to do. Mr. Speaker, this bill takes existing law and says, look, let's apply it the same regardless of which agency one is before. I think that is the difference there. I would be happy to meet with the gentleman in his office and see if we can find some ways that we can agree so that we might reform the overall antitrust system. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I am mainly concerned about this piece of legislation because you have determined--you have defined--a nonexistent problem while applying a less consumer friendly standard. That is my position. What I brought up here is part of the mix. It is putting it in context as to what has happened. The consequences of what has happened are higher prices for us--for you and me--and I know you are concerned about that. Mr. FARENTHOLD. In reclaiming my time, my point is that, if the gentleman thinks we have too many mergers, let's change the law, but let's have a fair procedure. What this bill is designed to do is to have a fair procedure for those who are engaged in that activity. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my friend from Texas. We went through a period of time in the first decade of this century of U.S. [[Page H1564]] prosecutors and attorneys looking at the subject of deferred prosecutions. I am talking about justice here. That is the bottom line. That is what we are talking about here. Instead of bringing corporations to trial that had violated the law-- and I am not an attorney. I am not the reason for two of my sons being attorneys, but I am not an attorney--they worked out a proposition. This is what they are trying to do, and this is what this is all about, if I could draw a comparison, which is you slap a corporation on the wrist, it pays a fine, and the fine becomes the cost of doing business. Mr. Speaker, this is going in the wrong direction. It is attacking a problem that does not exist instead of attacking a problem that does exist. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am anguished in listening to the pleas of my friend from Texas to help these megamergers, to help these big, multinational corporations. They need us so badly because the big, bad FTC is treating them too tough. It is too rough on them. Therefore, we have to make the law fairer for them. They have all of these silk stocking lawyers off of Wall Street, but we need to help them. We are not doing anything else here in Congress other than helping multinational corporations, hearing the plea that these folks need help when it is the folks in Flint, Michigan, who need help, who are crying out for help, but their voices can't be heard in this Congress because we are too busy trying to protect these big, multinational corporations. The only thing we want to do, according to my friends, is to harmonize the standard of proof between the DOJ and the FTC so that the big, bad corporations which need our help only have to deal with one standard of proof. They are not telling you what they are really wanting to do, which is to gut administrative review by the FTC, under section 5(b) of the FTC Act. That is where the real harm comes in, but they don't want to tell you about that. They don't want to let you know what kind of impact that has when a prescription drug company seeks to merge again with another large company and make a humongous company that is too big to fail and, also, too big to regulate your drug prices out there. Why are your drug prices going up? What kind of policies are we implementing here in Congress to protect them? Absolutely none. We are making it easier for prices to go up with insurance, in the travel industry, in trying to get a hotel. In trying to book a hotel room on the Internet, they have got it all rigged up because there are only a couple of companies you can go through to get the room. These are the policies that are affecting the lives of the people whom we represent. I don't represent many big, multinational corporations. I don't think I have any, as a matter of fact, in my district, but I guess there are some folks around here who have a bunch of them. {time} 1015 Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 10 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, since I have one speaker remaining, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, and I thank the chairman of the full committee and the author of this bill. I rise in combination of speaking on this bill, but also offering my deepest sympathy to the people of Brussels, the people of Belgium which, some would say, is the heart of the civic participation of Europe--they are certainly dear friends of the United States--though we would mourn any who have been impacted by the dastardly deeds of terrorism. I know in our committee, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Goodlatte are working on these issues. I would hope that we could move the no fly for foreign terrorists bill as quickly as possible as we make our way through these issues of determining how we disrupt the ideology and then the actions that result in the deaths of innocent persons. So I offer that. Mr. Speaker, I am struck by the name of this bill because I don't know who gets smarter. I know that the consumers get poorer and that there are opportunities for victimizing the consumers. This bill does not create equal rules or implement smarter legislation. But if I might take up the comment about the increasing cost of prescription drugs, that is clearly a result of not allowing the FTC to pursue and to proceed because it is our arm of equalizing and balancing the consumer. On this day, when we acknowledge the sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act that has brought health insurance to 20 million people, we know that what we need to fix is the rising cost of prescription drugs. So this bill is about attacking the administrative authority of the Federal Trade Commission. It is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally undermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and ability to prevent anticompetitive mergers. As a law student, I remember in my antitrust classes how the FTC was highlighted as one of the anchors of balance and the anchors of protection of innocent civilians. Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of power by eliminating the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger cases and by blocking its ability to use its administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction. Why is that? The FTC is where you can engage and have discussion. The bill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same enforcement process as the DOJ. There is more ability for the little guy to be heard at the FTC. This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and effectively removes a very core and functioning character of the agency, lets more people in the door to express themselves for or against this merger, how it impacts, with less resources needed to get in front of an administrative agency than dealing with the Department of Justice. Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with Congress' intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and policymaking body as a distinct and independent shield from political and executive interference. As enforcers of section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and DOJ have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and acquisitions that substantially lessen competition. That saves money because competition helps save money. These agencies serve to complement each other. Why make them the same? They are not twins. Based upon historical experience and coordinated development, the FTC serves to protect consumers and consumer spending, health care, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, food safety, among other things. The DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on larger corporate industries, like telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, they work together. Don't take away the consumers' arm. That is the FTC. This bill takes it away and puts the little guy under and the big guy up. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2745, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews through Equal Rules Act--otherwise known as the SMARTER Act. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about creating equal rules or implementing ``smarter'' legislation. Rather, it is about attacking the administrative authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). H.R. 2745 is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally undermine the FTC's independent enforcement authority and ability to prevent anti-competitive mergers. As we all know, the FTC was created by Congress with the specific intent of creating an independent antitrust enforcement agency and supplemental authority to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Specifically, if enacted, the SMARTER Act would strip the FTC of its power by eliminating [[Page H1565]] the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger cases, and by blocking its ability to use its administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction. The bill seeks to do so by requiring that the FTC use the same enforcement process as the DOJ. This proposed sweeping change undercuts the FTC's administrative litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and effectively removes the very core and functioning character of this agency. Moreover, reducing the FTC's independence directly conflicts with Congress's intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and policymaking body as distinct and independent shield from political and executive interference. As enforcers of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, both the FTC and the DOJ have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and acquisitions that would ``substantially lessen competition'' or ``tend to create a monopoly''. Under this enforcement authority, these agencies serve to complement each other, and have developed over the years to specialize in particular industries and markets. Based upon historical experience and coordinated developments, the FTC serves to protect consumers and consumer spending--e.g., healthcare, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, and certain high-tech industries like computer technology and internet services. Whereas, the DOJ typically assumes a specialized focus on larger corporate industries--e.g., telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. Thus, while the FTC and the DOJ have operated with a shared responsibility of enforcing federal antitrust laws, these two federal agencies are unique and each retain exclusive authority of certain conduct. Serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, the FTC and DOJ rely upon each other to coordinate agency jurisdiction and harmonized standards and practices. The SMARTER Act is simply unnecessary as it fails to put forth any meaningful effort to enhance or rectify any expressed concerns governing these longstanding agency operations. In particular, in 2002 Congress sought to review and amend antitrust laws and policies in light of changing economy and rise in technological advances. In 2007 a report issued by the Antitrust Modernization Commission (AMC) set forth specific recommendations for the FTC to eliminate real or perceived disparities in the review process for merger transactions. According to the AMC, Congress should seek to ensure that the same or comparable standard is used when seeking a preliminary injunction against a potentially anticompetitive transaction. However, the SMARTER Act goes beyond this recommendation and seeks to chip away and carve out the entire administrative adjudication authority of the FTC. In order to identify potential violations of the Clayton Act, the FTC and the DOJ review proposed merger transactions pursuant to the Hart- Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the HSR Act), which provides advance notice and sets forth guidelines on large merger and acquisition transactions. The heart of this concern is the alternate means in which the FTC and the DOJ carry out their enforcement role during this HSR pre-merger process. Namely, H.R. 2745 is curiously motivated by the preliminary injunction process utilized by the FTC and the DOJ to halt proposed transactions that would violate the Clayton Act if completed. Additionally, the DOJ typically consolidates the preliminary and permanent injunction proceedings, while the FTC typically only pursues the preliminary injunction. While some argue that proposed transactions reviewed through the FTC would be treated more leniently than those reviewed through the DOJ, this assertion was not fully substantiated by the AMC. The pre-merger review process and the injunction standards utilized by the FTC and the DOJ are the very procedural steps that characterize and distinguish the respective enforcement roles of these agencies. This supposed area of concern addresses only a small fraction of proposed transactions, as the vast majority of merger and acquisition proposals are found to not be in violation of the Clayton Act during the review process. The FTC and the DOJ review over a thousand merger filings every year. Yet 95% of those merger filings present no competitive issues or challenged transactions. As reported by the American Antitrust Institute (AAI), the overall concerns purported by the bill's sponsors are simply without foundation. In contrast, the overall work of the FTC has an incredible impact on American consumers, communities and corporations and will be severely impacted if disrupted. As highlighted by the FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in her testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, the FTC prioritizes the protection of consumers and the prevention of anticompetitive market practices. In fact, the FTC exists to ensure fair competition and to prevent enormous concentrations of economic power that hurts consumers and small businesses. For example: In the past year, the FTC has challenged over 28 mergers, (although in most it was able to negotiate a remedy to allow the merger to proceed). At the consumer level in my home state of Texas, the FTC secured an $82,000 settlement against an auto-dealer found in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in September 2015. Also last year, the FTC ordered the largest divestiture ever in a supermarket merger, requiring Albertsons and Safeway to sell 168 supermarkets in 130 local markets throughout several states, ensuring that communities continue to benefit from competition among their local supermarkets. The FTC has also taken an aggressive stance on stopping anticompetitive mergers and conduct in the healthcare market by halting such practices through administrative litigation. In September 2015, the FTC secured a $1.1 million settlement to consumers who lost money to a health insurance telemarketing scam. And in the last two years, the FTC took action in 13 pharmaceutical mergers, ordering divestitures to preserve competition for drugs that treat diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, as well as widely used generic medications like oral contraceptives and antibiotics. Just last week on March 18, 2016, after a thoroughly vetted investigation, the FTC approved a final order preserving competition among outpatient dialysis clinics in Laredo, Texas. That is, the FTC cleared U.S. Renal Care, Inc.'s (the country's third largest outpatient dialysis provider) $640 million purchase of dialysis competitor DSI Renal, on the condition that three of DSI's outpatient clinics in Laredo, Texas, be handed over to a third party. Absent this agreed divestiture, the acquisition would have led to a significant increase in market concentration and anti-competitive effects. The likely result, according to the FTC, would have included the elimination of direct competition between U.S. Renal Care and DSI Renal, reduced incentives to improve services or quality for dialysis patients, and increased ability for the merged company to unilaterally increase prices. Notably, the DOJ has also been successful in securing investigations and halting suspected harmful merger practices on a much larger scale (in the health care and airline industry as of recent). In June 2015, the DOJ put pressure on several multibillion dollar health insurers seeking to engage in large merger transactions with near certain suppression of market competition in the healthcare industry. In August 2015, the DOJ issued civil investigative demands on several major US airlines seeking to halt any potential unlawful mergers. These cases demonstrate the need for continued protection of the FTC and its ability to effectively carry out injunctions on harmful merger and acquisition activities, as well as anticompetitive business conduct that harms consumers and restrains market activity. The ability of the FTC to function independently is a necessary function to the success of both the FTC and the DOJ. The far-reaching and elusive SMARTER Act fails keep the foundational integrity of these agencies and should be opposed. I urge all Members to vote against this serious threat to our fundamental protections of consumers and fair economic competition. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. It is not often that I come to the floor to argue a bill and to debate and nobody on the other side shows up to participate in the debate. I have been feeling kind of lonely over here. I guess that people are too embarrassed on the other side to come here and defend this legislation at this particular time, as we get ready to depart for what will be just about 3 weeks, while we are leaving dangling and hanging important issues, like a budget for this country that was promised to us back at the beginning of the year. It was supposed to be regular order. It was supposed to be that we are going to do a budget. After the budget is done and we have our top lines and bottom lines in place, then we will embark upon the appropriations process and we will pass all of [[Page H1566]] the 12 appropriations bills for the first time in years and we will get back to regular order around here. They can't even produce enough votes to pass a budget. So what do we do then? We revert to trying to protect and coddle and make things easy for big multinational corporations that want to get bigger. They want to get bigger so that they can get a lock on the market, they have no competition, and then they can set whatever price they want to set and the American people are left having to pay. What can you do when you need your prescription medication and there is no competition, no other similar drug, and you only have one player in the room; therefore, you have to pay whatever they are holding you over the barrel for. The American people are sick and tired and they are angry about having been held over a barrel year after year after year as this Congress continues to coddle and protect and make things good for big business. Well, what about the working people of this country? When are we going to do something about making sure that they don't have to pay these increased bills that they would have to pay for things like hotel rooms, insurance, medical care, prescription drugs, nursing homes, and food? I don't even want to talk about the price of gas that is going to go up this summer. Despite the fact that we have a glut in the oil market, you are going to be seeing your gas prices rise. Why? Because you are getting out on the road and trying to go on vacation. It is getting more and more difficult to do that because wages haven't gone up. So this Congress continues to make it easy for big corporations to increase their profits while doing nothing to raise wages for the regular working people of this country. Now we are getting ready to go on another 3-week district work period. I have a lot of work to do in the district trying to explain to the people of my district why we are not getting down to business and doing the things that they expect this Congress to do. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues in this body oppose the SMARTER Act and do what is right for the American people. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Let's look at the arguments, the straw men that have been set up by the other party claiming that this legislation does a manner of things that it simply does not do. First, they say enacting the SMARTER Act only benefits large companies that wish to merge, but the SMARTER Act protects small and midsize companies which also come under the Federal Trade Commission's scrutiny. This legislation is not designed to help big companies get bigger. Indeed, large companies have the resources to hire the lawyers, economists, lobbyists, and other regulatory professionals to wrestle with the FTC. It is the small- and medium-size companies that would benefit from a fair process and an assurance that they would have their day in court. The FTC does not always focus its attention on the large companies. In fact, a Wall Street Journal article from 2013 documents how the FTC pursued anticompetitive practices of the Music Teachers National Association, a nonprofit with about a dozen employees. In short, this nonprofit was a collection of piano teachers. So if you think the FTC only engages with conglomerates, you are mistaken. They will even prosecute your after-school piano teacher. The SMARTER Act ensures that, if the FTC does focus its efforts on piano teachers, on the small- and medium-size companies, they will have the benefit of a fair process. Then they make the argument that the SMARTER Act will make it more difficult for antitrust enforcement agencies to stop a merger, but the SMARTER Act only changes the process. It does not have any substantive impact on merger reviews. The SMARTER Act does not make any substantive changes to antitrust law. Rather, the legislation only standardizes the process between the two antitrust enforcement agencies. The witnesses at the committee hearings on the SMARTER Act testified that the legislation only affects the process and not the substantive standard. As Deborah Garza, former chairwoman of the Antitrust Modernization Commission stated: No one on the AMC believed at the time, and I do not believe today, that this legislation would make it difficult or impossible for the FTC Commission to do its job. The Justice Department has done very well in pursuing its merger enforcement agenda working with the standards that apply to it. And I firmly believe that the FTC can do so as well. Indeed, even the current Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General for the antitrust division stated: I do not think there is a practical difference in how the courts assess the factual and legal basis for enjoining a merger challenged by the FTC on the one hand and the Department on the other. Let me also quote from a letter written by 15 leading antitrust professors who wrote to Congress expressing their support for the SMARTER Act: The FTC is a very impressive agency that plays a valuable role in antitrust enforcement. The SMARTER Act does nothing to undermine the FTC's authority. It simply ensures that the merger review processes and standards are equally applied to merger parties, regardless of which agency reviews the transaction. The gentleman from New Jersey complained about what was going on with the review of proposed mergers by health insurance companies. Guess what. Who is doing those reviews? Not the FTC. The Department of Justice. It doesn't make any sense. What does make sense is that there are lots of companies going through lots of things caused, in part, by ObamaCare forcing healthcare providers, insurance companies, and others to look at mergers and acquisitions. When they do so, the public should have the right to know that justice is being done. This is not about big business or small business. This is about making sure that the laws are fairly and equally applied. When that happens, we should have this legislation at hand so that we have the assurance that we are going to have justice done. The FTC should operate by the same merger review processes and standards that the Department of Justice does. I believe in the vigorous prosecution of antitrust practices and transactions by the Department of Justice and the FTC. I would not support the SMARTER Act if I thought that it would disadvantage our antitrust enforcement agencies. The Congressional Record demonstrates that the SMARTER Act only makes the process more fair and predictable while providing the antitrust enforcement agencies with the same powers to prosecute antitrust practices. {time} 1030 The SMARTER Act is a commonsense process reform that ensures fairness and parity in the narrow field of merger reviews. The bill was recommended to Congress by a bipartisan commission and is supported by former top Department of Justice antitrust enforcement officials and past and present FTC Commissioners of both political parties. This legislation will help America continue to serve as a leader and innovator in competition law, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2745, the ``Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015'' or SMARTER Act, would require the Federal Trade Commission to use the same merger enforcement procedures as the Justice Department's Antitrust Division for proposed mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and other similar transactions. I oppose this flawed bill for several reasons. Most importantly, H.R. 2745--by weakening the Commission's independence--undermines Congress's original intent in creating the Federal Trade Commission in the first place. For good reasons that are still relevant today, Congress established the Commission to be an independent administrative agency. Although the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 empowered the Justice Department to enforce antitrust laws, Congress determined that more needed to be done to address the wave of mergers and anti-competitive corporate abuses that continued notwithstanding the enactment of that Act. [[Page H1567]] Accordingly, Congress created the Commission in 1914 as an independent body of experts charged with developing antitrust law and policy free from political influence, and particularly executive branch interference. To this end, Congress specifically gave the Commission broad administrative powers to investigate and enforce laws to stop unfair methods of competition as well as the authority to use an administrative adjudication process to develop policy expertise, rather than requiring the Commission to try cases before a generalist federal judge. Yet, rather than strengthening the Commission's independence and enforcement authority, the SMARTER Act does the opposite. Of greatest concern is the bill's elimination of the administrative adjudication process for merger cases under section 5(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. By doing so, the SMARTER Act would effectively transform the Commission from an independent administrative agency into just another competition enforcement agency indistinguishable from the Justice Department and, thereby, arguable redundant. The Commission's administrative authority is key to its distinctive role as an independent administrative agency. But the SMARTER Act--by eliminating the Commission's administrative authority--opens the door for the ultimate elimination of the Commission. And, you do not just have to take my word for it. Former Republican Commission Chairman William Kovacic, while expressing support for the bill's harmonization of preliminary injunction standards, says that the ``rest of the SMARTER Act is rubbish.'' He continued, ``Let me put it this way: behind the rest of [the SMARTER Act] is the fundamental question of whether you want the Federal Trade Commission involved in competition law.'' Similarly, current Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez observes that the bill would have ``far-reaching immediate effects'' and ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the Commission, as well as the potential for significant unintended consequences.'' Consumers Union also opposes the SMARTER Act not only because it is completely unnecessary, but also because the bill could ``create unintended hurdles to effective and sound enforcement'' and ``set the stage for further tinkering--both of which risk undermining what is now a coherent, consistent, well-established, familiar enforcement procedure within the'' Commission. Finally, the SMARTER Act is problematic because it may apply to conduct well-beyond large mergers, which could further hinder the Commission's effectiveness. In particular, the SMARTER Act would eliminate the Commission's authority to use administrative adjudications not just for the largest mergers, but for non-merger activity, like a ``joint venture'' or ``similar transaction.'' I recognize that the bill's authors have tried in good faith to respond to some of the concerns expressed by me and by the Commission during the last Congress and I appreciate those efforts. Moreover, I recognize that the Commission itself last year changed its procedural rules to make it easier to end the use of administrative litigation where it loses a preliminary injunction proceeding in court. I continue to have concerns, however, about the bill's prohibition against the Commission's administrative litigation authority with respect to all merger cases. Accordingly, I must oppose the SMARTER Act, even in its rewritten form, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to H.R. 2745. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 653, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. DOGGETT. I am. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Doggett moves to recommit the bill (H.R. 2745) to the Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to report the bill back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At the end of the bill, add the following: SEC. 5. PROTECTING CONSUMERS AGAINST HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. (a) This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs. (b) The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.12 et seq.) and Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 et seq.) as in effect immediately before the date of the enactment of this Act shall apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for many months now so many of us Democrats here in the House have been pleading with our Republican colleagues to recognize that there is a very serious cost to the American people of prescription price gouging; such a serious matter that, overwhelmingly, in the fall, when the Kaiser Family Foundation surveyed healthcare concerns of Americans, the number one issue was soaring, unaffordable prescription drugs. We have not been very successful in getting their attention on this just to recognize the severity of the problem--not even getting to the point of agreeing on what legislative action this Congress, this administration might take in order to address this problem. We got another indication of the severity of the problem and the way that people across America are being impacted by the Republican failure to address prescription price gouging in the latest survey done this year by AARP, their RxPrice Watch report, which found the average retail price among 622 prescription medicines that are widely used by seniors more than doubled from less than $6,000 in 2006 to over $11,000 in 2013. That is an incredible increase. It is not just seniors who are impacted, but working families, people all over the United States, by the fact that prescription drug prices are rising much faster than the cost of living and other health care. Now, we have been asking for months that Republicans recognize the severity of this problem. I have asked in the Committee on Ways and Means. We cannot even get a hearing on the subject. Our colleagues have asked, in the Commerce Committee, how about a hearing to look at what is happening to the American people on these outrageous prescription price increases that just keep increasing and increasing? The Commerce Committee has refused to hold a hearing on it. The Committee on Appropriations has been asked to review and consider this problem. They won't hold a hearing on it. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, under the leadership of Elijah Cummings as the ranking Democrat, asked for a subpoena. Finally--and it is appropriate for this bill, they call it the SMARTER Act, and Republicans are always so much better at naming their legislation than what is in it--we had a smart aleck who got subpoenaed, the guy who thought it was okay to raise the price of an over 60-year-old drug by over 5,000 percent in 1 day, having a big impact on people who needed it for reduced immunity from any number of kinds of treatments, a 5,000 percent increase, and they at least were willing to get him over video to make his various smart-aleck remarks about his ability to do that. Competition by itself is not solving the problem with the soaring cost of prescription drugs. But trying to maintain competition, if Republicans won't recognize how endangered so many Americans are by prescription price gouging, we ought not to go backwards, and that is what I fear this bill would do. Let me give you a precise example. On November 18, the Federal Trade Commission, which would be impacted by this bill, approved a final order that was concerned with the merger on generic drugs that treat certain types of ulcers and thyroid conditions. This is the merger, an $8 billion merger between Endo International and Par Pharmaceuticals. The FTC was concerned about the effect on competition and raising prices and gouging consumers even more than is occurring already. I do not want to impair in any way their ability to initiate litigation, to be involved, to see that competition remains--to the limited extent it is now--and not see seniors or working families with a sick child or anyone who gets a sad diagnosis of a life-threatening disease and then finds themselves facing financial ruin even if they have insurance, to see [[Page H1568]] one of the few tools we have to deal with these anticompetitive provisions eliminated by this bill. This is the last amendment on the bill. It will not send the bill back to committee. It will at least preserve this one narrow area. If Republicans won't recognize the problem, at least don't go make it worse. They could be bringing up bills to this floor like the one that had bipartisan support about 8 or 9 years ago. Former Representative John Dingell had a bill so that we would begin to have Medicare negotiate prices with these pharmaceutical companies. Twenty-four Republicans even joined us. That is the kind of bipartisan action we need. At least approve this motion to recommit. Let the bill move forward, but without gouging consumers on prescription drug prices even more than they are today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that, because of ObamaCare and government regulation, the cost of prescription drugs is going up--and going up too fast. We definitely need to reform our healthcare system, starting with repealing ObamaCare and putting in place real patient-centered reforms to our healthcare system, but that is not what this legislation is about today. The SMARTER Act is predicated on a very simple notion: the results of an antitrust merger review should not be dependent on which antitrust enforcement agency happens to review the deal. The outcome should not be determined by the flip of an agency coin. The SMARTER Act is a process reform that ensures that all parties have their day in court and are subject to the same standards, regardless of which antitrust enforcement agency reviews their merger. The motion to recommit defeats this simple reform by carving out an exception for one area. Why, if we are seeking justice, why, if we are seeking a fair standard for all people before these antitrust review agencies, would we take this particular area and say, no, we are not going to have a consistent standard for reviewing something that the gentleman feels is so important. We all feel that is very important, and that is why we all should oppose this motion to recommit and vote for the underlying bill. I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and the motion to suspend the rules and agree to House Resolution 658. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 174, nays 235, not voting 24, as follows: [Roll No. 136] YEAS--174 Adams Aguilar Beatty Becerra Beyer Bishop (GA) Bonamici Brady (PA) Brownley (CA) Bustos Butterfield Capps Capuano Cardenas Carney Carson (IN) Cartwright Castor (FL) Castro (TX) Chu, Judy Cicilline Clark (MA) Clarke (NY) Clay Cleaver Clyburn Cohen Connolly Conyers Cooper Costa Courtney Crowley Cuellar Cummings Davis (CA) Davis, Danny DeFazio DeGette Delaney DeLauro DelBene DeSaulnier Deutch Dingell Doggett Doyle, Michael F.

Had I been present, I would have voted ``no.'' ____________________",package_114_292.csv,75825,75825,75895,"[congressional record volume 162, number 46 (wednesday, march 23, 2016)] [house] [pages h1560-h1569] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] standard merger and acquisition reviews through equal rules act of 2015 mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, pursuant to house resolution 653, i call up the bill (h.r. 2745) to amend the clayton act and the federal trade commission act to provide that the federal trade commission shall exercise authority with respect to mergers only under the clayton act and only in the same procedural manner as the attorney general exercises such authority, and ask for its immediate consideration. the clerk read the title of the bill. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 653, the bill is considered read. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2745 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``standard merger and acquisition reviews through equal rules act of 2015''. sec. 2. amendments to the clayton act. the clayton act (15 u.s.c. 12 et seq.) is amended-- (1) by striking section 4f and inserting the following: ``sec. 4f. actions by attorney general of the united states or the federal trade commission. ``(a) whenever the attorney general of the united states has brought an action under the antitrust laws or the federal trade commission has brought an action under section 7, and the attorney general or federal trade commission, as applicable, has reason to believe that any state attorney general would be entitled to bring an action under this act based substantially on the same alleged violation of the antitrust laws or section 7, the attorney general or federal trade commission, as applicable, shall promptly give written notification thereof to such state attorney general. ``(b) to assist a state attorney general in evaluating the notice described in subsection (a) or in bringing any action under this act, the attorney general of the united states or federal trade commission, as applicable, shall, upon request by such state attorney general, make available to the state attorney general, to the extent permitted by law, any investigative files or other materials which are or may be relevant or material to the actual or potential cause of action under this act.''; (2) in section 5-- (a) in subsection (a) by inserting ``(including a proceeding brought by the federal trade commission with respect to a violation of section 7)'' after ``united states under the antitrust laws''; and (b) in subsection (i) by inserting ``(including a proceeding instituted by the federal trade commission with respect to a violation of section 7)'' after ``antitrust laws''; (3) in section 11, by adding at the end the following: ``(m)(1) except as provided in paragraph (2), in enforcing compliance with section 7, the federal trade commission shall enforce compliance with that section in the same manner as the attorney general in accordance with section 15. ``(2) if the federal trade commission approves an agreement with the parties to the transaction that contains a consent order with respect to a violation of section 7, the commission shall enforce compliance with that section in accordance with this section.''; (4) in section 13, by inserting ``(including a suit, action, or proceeding brought by the federal trade commission with respect to a violation of section 7)'' before ``subpoenas''; and (5) in section 15, by inserting ``and the duty of the federal trade commission with respect to a violation of section 7,'' after ``general,''. sec. 3. amendments to the federal trade commission act. the federal trade commission act (15 u.s.c. 41) is amended-- (1) in section 5(b), by inserting ``(excluding the consummation of a proposed merger, acquisition, joint venture, or similar transaction that is subject to section 7 of the clayton act (15 u.s.c. 18), except in cases where the commission approves an agreement with the parties to the transaction that contains a consent order)'' after ``unfair method of competition''; (2) in section 9, by inserting after the fourth undesignated paragraph the following: [[page h1561]] ``upon the application of the commission with respect to any activity related to the consummation of a proposed merger, acquisition, joint venture, or similar transaction that is subject to section 7 of the clayton act (15 u.s.c. 18) that may result in any unfair method of competition, the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding any person or corporation to comply with the provisions of this act or any order of the commission made in pursuance thereof.''.

the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary. the gentleman from virginia (mr. goodlatte) and the gentleman from georgia (mr. johnson) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from virginia. general leave mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on h.r. 2745, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from virginia? there was no objection. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, in 1914, congress passed the federal trade commission act, marking the beginning of a dual antitrust enforcement regime in the united states. because both the department of justice and the federal trade commission enforce our nation's antitrust laws, companies may and often do have different experiences when interacting with one agency relative to the other. one area in which the disparity can be the most striking and troubling is in the merger review process. when a company wishes to merge with or purchase another company, it must notify both antitrust enforcement agencies of the proposed transaction. the department of justice and the federal trade commission then determine which agency will be responsible for reviewing the transaction. as there are no fixed rules for making this determination, it can appear that the decision is made on the basis of a flip of the coin. there are two substantive differences that companies face based on the identity of the antitrust enforcement agency that reviews the company's proposed transaction. the first difference arises if the agency seeks to prevent the transaction by pursuing a preliminary injunction in federal court. a different legal standard is applied to a preliminary injunction request based solely on the identity of the requesting antitrust enforcement agency. the second difference lies in the process available to each antitrust enforcement agency to prevent a transaction from proceeding. the ftc may pursue administrative litigation against a proposed transaction even after a court denies its preliminary injunction request. in contrast, the department of justice cannot pursue administrative litigation. there is no justification for these disparities in the merger review processes and standards. the bipartisan antitrust modernization commission recommended that congress remove these disparities, and the bill before us today, the standard merger and acquisition reviews through equal rules act, or smarter act, does just that. i applaud mr. farenthold of texas for introducing this important legislation that will enhance the transparency, predictability, and credibility of the antitrust merger review process. by enacting the smarter act into law, congress will ensure that companies no longer will be subjected to fundamentally different processes and standards based on the flip of a coin. notably, the legislation has garnered the support of former and current ftc commissioners, including former chairman david clanton, former commissioner josh wright, and sitting commissioner maureen ohlhausen. the smarter act is an important step toward ensuring that our nation's antitrust laws are enforced in a manner that is fair, consistent, and predictable. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this good government bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong opposition to the so-called smarter act, the standard merger and acquisition reviews through equal rules act, which really should--i mean, it is a misnomer. we should rename this bill. instead of that, we should rename it the sadly more acronyms for really terrible and esoteric requirements act. {time} 0945 i know a lot of people around the country are wondering: well, what is this all about? it must be important that they are doing this. i will tell you what is important about it. it is a piece of legislation that would impact the largest and most consequential of corporate mergers, of multinational corporate mergers. those things have to go through a review process with our federal trade commission. also, the department of justice has an antitrust division. what this piece of legislation would do would be to gut one of the agency's--the ftc's--ability to oversee and deal with merger review issues that affect the largest and most consequential of their mergers, of these big corporate mergers. does this piece of legislation benefit the people? or does it benefit the 1 percent of large multinational corporations that, i guess, need help avoiding regulatory authority by our government? well, it looks like that is what it is. it is something that is going to help out big business at a time when people in this country are very angry about the fact that the playing field is not level. the corporations and the wealthy have been doing pretty well over the last couple of generations, but people are seeing their wages stand right there where they were. they are working harder, they are more productive, but yet they can't even take a vacation. they can't even afford to take a day off to see about a sick child. this is why people are so angry. it is because they look at congress and they see us doing this kind of work benefiting 1 percent of the largest multinational corporations when there are other things like passing a budget, dealing with the zika crisis which is unfolding, dealing with the flint water crisis, dealing with the opioid addiction crisis in this country. we can't even pass a budget. here we are going to pass the so-called smarter act today, and then we are going to go home for almost 3 weeks. they call it a district work period, but it is actually a period where folks are out campaigning, trying to retain their seats. people are angry about that. congress first established the federal trade commission in 1914 to safeguard consumers against anticompetitive behavior by empowering the commission with the authority to enforce, clarify, and develop antitrust law. president woodrow wilson later described the creation of the commission as specifically providing for tribunals that would ``determine what was fair and what was unfair competition; and to supply the business community not merely with lawyers in the department of justice who could cry, `stop!', but [[page h1562]] with men in such tribunals as the federal trade commission who could say, `go on,' who could warn where things were going wrong and assist instead of check.'' today, under the process of administrative litigation, also known as part 3 litigation, the commission does just that. under this authority, it may seek permanent injunctions in its own administrative court in addition to its ability to seek preliminary injunctions in federal district court. this authority is a unique mechanism that takes advantage of the commission's longstanding expertise to develop some of the most complex issues in antitrust law. but the smarter act would upend this century of precedent and expertise by creating a uniform standard for preliminary injunctions in cases involving significant mergers and other transactions and, alarmingly, eliminating the commission's ability to administratively litigate antitrust cases. proponents of the smarter act argue that divergent standards for enjoining mergers may undermine the public's trust in the efficient and fair outcome of merger cases. they also state that the outcome of a transaction comes down to a coin flip between the agencies to determine which will review a transaction. that claim is ridiculous and it is not borne out by the evidence. the american antitrust institute, a consumer-oriented antitrust organization, conducted a lengthy study of workload statistics compiled by both antitrust agencies and found that the concerns of the bill's sponsors are without foundation. jonathan jacobson, a leading antitrust attorney who served on the antitrust modernization commission, testified that in his 39 years of practice, the outcome of a merger has never turned on the differences that the smarter act seeks to address in antitrust law. indeed, of the 3 percent of transactions requiring second requests for information from the antitrust agencies, only about 1.5 percent of those cases are stopped or modified. an even smaller percentage of these cases go to trial for an administrative hearing. we should hesitate before making wholesale changes to the law based on theoretical concerns involving about 1 percent of mergers, which also happen to be some of the largest and most consequential. in the absence of any meaningful evidence suggesting a material difference in the enforcement of the antitrust laws, it is difficult to upending longstanding antitrust practices at the ftc for consistency's sake alone based on speculative harms. but even assuming that there are material differences in cases brought under these standards, we should strike a balance in favor of competition by lowering the burden of proof in cases brought by the justice department, not by raising the commission's burden for obtaining preliminary injunctions. courts already require a lower burden of proof in cases brought by the commission and justice department precisely because both are expert agencies equipped with large staffs of economists who analyze numerous mergers on a regular basis and who may only bring cases that are in the public interest. to the extent that we should address perceived differences in the standard for preliminary injunctions in merger cases, legislation should favor increased competition, not the interests of merging parties. the smarter act would eliminate the ftc's authority to administratively litigate mergers and other transactions under section 5(b) of the ftc act. leading authorities in antitrust across party lines have expressed serious reservations with eliminating the commission's administrative litigation authority. for instance, bill kovacic, a former republican chair of the commission, has referred to this aspect of the bill as ``rubbish,'' noting that the commission has used administrative litigation to win a string of novel antitrust cases that courts have ultimately upheld where the ``commission has had to fight for every single foot along the way.'' edith ramirez, the chairwoman of the ftc, likewise wrote last congress that eliminating the ftc's administrative litigation authority would ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the ftc.'' mr. speaker, 2015 was the year of the merger, megamergers, mergermania. there was over $3.8 trillion in merger spending, a record that far exceeded expectations. while fewer than 20 percent of mergers raise competition concerns, it is clear that a vote for h.r. 2745 is a vote for concentrated, private economic power. at a time of increased consolidation in key industries, we can't afford more republican attacks on government, which is what h.r. 2745 is, plain and simple. i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from texas (mr. farenthold), a member of the judiciary committee, and the vice chair of the subcommittee on regulatory reform, commercial, and antitrust law. mr. farenthold. mr. speaker, it is a privilege to be here today to be the sponsor of the smarter act. this is just good government. we have a situation now that if you want to merge your company with another company, you could go before the federal trade commission or you could go before the department of justice. now, you would think that the clayton act that governs antitrust law would say: all right. well, we are going to get treated the same, no matter which way we go, the law is the law. but that is not how it works. a big piece of this is the procedural aspect of it. if your merger is reviewed by the department of justice and they have a problem with it and they need a preliminarily injunction to stop it, they go to federal court before a judge, as the founding fathers intended, the executive branch agency, and there is a dispute, and it is litigated in front of a federal court. but if you go before the federal trade commission, they could go to federal court like the department of justice, but they can also go to their own court. they have got their own court with an ftc employee as the judge. now, we have got administrative law courts that work, but they can also do both. you have got a situation that the merger could be delayed. in these business transactions, as in life, time is money. just the threat of going through this administrative process has the effect of giving the ftc the ability to extract concessions that the doj wouldn't. look, we need to be treated fairly no matter which agency reviews it. this is the main gist of the smarter act. let's make it the same if you go to the doj or the ftc. this isn't just something that we, republicans, pulled out of our hats. this is a recommendation from the bipartisan antitrust modification commission. they have testified that this is part of what they think needs to be done to make a better, more efficient government. listen, nobody wants to be tied up in red tape. as you go through a merger and you draw the short straw and end up in front of the ftc, you have got another spool of red tape that you could very possibly get rolled up in. i don't think that is fair and i don't think the american people think that is fair. now, my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from georgia (mr. johnson), says this guts the antitrust laws. it doesn't. it just makes them fairer. it makes the review the same no matter where you go. it is commonsense, good government. i don't have anything else to say. i don't see how you can be against fairness. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. speaker, before i recognize the honorable bill pascrell from new jersey, who serves on, by the way, the budget and the ways and means committees here in congress, i would like to point out that we have got a severe problem that we are confronting this morning. it is the big, bad ftc, which is treating the big multinational corporations unfairly. it is abusing them, and something needs to be done. the american people are demanding it. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pascrell) so that he can explain further how important this bill is to the american people. mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, i thank the ranking member for yielding. [[page h1563]] this bill is terrible. the federal trade commission is tasked with protecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. what i just heard from the gentleman is that this is all about getting rid of red tape. baloney. this is about money, this is about keeping money in your own pocket and protecting yourself against the consumers. {time} 1000 concessions we are talking about here. the federal trade commission is tasked with protecting consumers from anticompetitive mergers. that is what the job is. corporate mergers can make industries more efficient and bring benefits to customers, but in some cases, they have the potential to increase costs and hurt competition. mr. speaker, if you deny that, then you don't have the facts, and i am going to lay them out right now. government should not be in the business of setting prices for healthcare services or anything else for that matter--for airline tickets, cable internet services, or anything else. i hope we agree on that. that is why we need to rely on robust market competition--to keep the prices of goods and services down and ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal. i tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, with due respect, that we are pretty good fans of competition; yet here we are, after bloomberg dubbed 2015 the ``year of the mergers,'' weakening a key ftc tool to ensure healthy competition in a variety of markets. mr. speaker, i have been particularly concerned with this issue, and i mentioned four areas here. i am very, very concerned about the mergers we have seen in many sectors of the healthcare industry. read my lips: look at the facts through the speaker. in my left hand, a recent report by the health care pricing project, which was written up in the new york times late last year, found that monopoly hospitals have prices that are 15.3 percent higher than hospitals in an area with four or more hospitals--even after controlling for costs in each area. don't you really believe in competition, or do you just say that? is that simply a bumper sticker, a slogan, or do you mean that? two pending mergers in the insurance industry, between anthem and cigna and aetna and humana, set the stage for major consolidation in this industry as well. in other words, what this report did was establish the fact--i hope you are interested in the facts--that the reason we have increasing healthcare costs--a major reason--is for the merger and the reduction in competition in health care. then there are the mergers that are motivated by u.s. tax dodging, mr. speaker, and we have talked about this, which have major implications on competition but also on the united states tax base. one pending merger would see a major united states company slash its united states tax bill by moving its headquarters overseas and creating the largest drug company in the universe. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. johnson of georgia. i yield the gentleman an additional 1\1/2\ minutes. mr. pascrell. working americans across the country do not have the benefit of hiring consultants, of shifting their earned income around the globe to find the lowest tax rate. and you are standing there, saying you want to help the consumer? it is just the opposite. many multinational corporations do just that. corporate inversions allow companies to renege on the obligation to america, eroding the united states tax base and hurting american competitiveness. who are you with anyway? if you live in a neighborhood and one house--let's say the biggest house on the block--doesn't pay its property taxes, what happens? everyone understands that the rest of the houses on the block have to make up the difference. the treasury has taken steps to address inversions, but it is up to congress to pass legislation that addresses this problem immediately. in the meantime, the bill before us today would weaken the ftc's ability to monitor and enforce against unfair, anticompetitive mergers, and they are all over the place. i blame, partially, the administration, as the former attorney general did nothing about mergers. while people were trying to get him to resign for other reasons, that would have been a darned good reason. this is not republican or democrat, my friends. these are simply the facts, and i can tell you this one report will very, very much crystallize what those facts are. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from texas (mr. farenthold). mr. farenthold. mr. speaker, i appreciate the gentleman from new jersey's commitment to the free market, because i think we all believe a free and fair market is in the best interest of america and in the best interest of every american consumer, but we have got to take a look at the procedure. this is, primarily, procedural in nature so that those companies that are seeking mergers, whether they go through the ftc or through the department of justice, are simply treated the same. if the gentleman is concerned about the fact that there are too many mergers--that we are getting bigger and bigger companies and that it is stifling competition--that is a legitimate conversation for us to have in the context of changing the law with respect to monopolies, mergers, and acquisitions. what we are trying to do here is not change that law, but make that law fairer and applied equally, regardless of whether one is in front of the department of justice or whether one is in front of the federal trade commission. if the gentleman takes that argument, then he is saying, right now, the ftc has an advantage in stopping these mergers because it has all of these other procedures in place, as opposed to the department of justice. why should one get stuck with a tougher row to hoe based on which agency one goes in front of? that is just not fair. mr. pascrell. will the gentleman yield? mr. farenthold. i yield to the gentleman from new jersey. mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, what we need to understand is that we are not only talking about the ftc, we are talking about the justice department, which oversees these mergers regardless of whether we are talking about health or airlines, which is a catastrophe. i only brought up health care today. we are having that discussion you just talked about. mr. farenthold. in reclaiming my time, i think the gentleman has a problem with the fact that there are so many mergers and that he thinks it is anticompetitive and not good for folks. that is an opinion that the gentleman is, certainly, entitled to, but that is, i think, out of the scope of what this bill is trying to do. mr. speaker, this bill takes existing law and says, look, let's apply it the same regardless of which agency one is before. i think that is the difference there. i would be happy to meet with the gentleman in his office and see if we can find some ways that we can agree so that we might reform the overall antitrust system. i yield to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pascrell). mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, i am mainly concerned about this piece of legislation because you have determined--you have defined--a nonexistent problem while applying a less consumer friendly standard. that is my position. what i brought up here is part of the mix. it is putting it in context as to what has happened. the consequences of what has happened are higher prices for us--for you and me--and i know you are concerned about that. mr. farenthold. in reclaiming my time, my point is that, if the gentleman thinks we have too many mergers, let's change the law, but let's have a fair procedure. what this bill is designed to do is to have a fair procedure for those who are engaged in that activity. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pascrell). mr. pascrell. mr. speaker, i would like to respond to my friend from texas. we went through a period of time in the first decade of this century of u.s. [[page h1564]] prosecutors and attorneys looking at the subject of deferred prosecutions. i am talking about justice here. that is the bottom line. that is what we are talking about here. instead of bringing corporations to trial that had violated the law-- and i am not an attorney. i am not the reason for two of my sons being attorneys, but i am not an attorney--they worked out a proposition. this is what they are trying to do, and this is what this is all about, if i could draw a comparison, which is you slap a corporation on the wrist, it pays a fine, and the fine becomes the cost of doing business. mr. speaker, this is going in the wrong direction. it is attacking a problem that does not exist instead of attacking a problem that does exist. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am anguished in listening to the pleas of my friend from texas to help these megamergers, to help these big, multinational corporations. they need us so badly because the big, bad ftc is treating them too tough. it is too rough on them. therefore, we have to make the law fairer for them. they have all of these silk stocking lawyers off of wall street, but we need to help them. we are not doing anything else here in congress other than helping multinational corporations, hearing the plea that these folks need help when it is the folks in flint, michigan, who need help, who are crying out for help, but their voices can't be heard in this congress because we are too busy trying to protect these big, multinational corporations. the only thing we want to do, according to my friends, is to harmonize the standard of proof between the doj and the ftc so that the big, bad corporations which need our help only have to deal with one standard of proof. they are not telling you what they are really wanting to do, which is to gut administrative review by the ftc, under section 5(b) of the ftc act. that is where the real harm comes in, but they don't want to tell you about that. they don't want to let you know what kind of impact that has when a prescription drug company seeks to merge again with another large company and make a humongous company that is too big to fail and, also, too big to regulate your drug prices out there. why are your drug prices going up? what kind of policies are we implementing here in congress to protect them? absolutely none. we are making it easier for prices to go up with insurance, in the travel industry, in trying to get a hotel. in trying to book a hotel room on the internet, they have got it all rigged up because there are only a couple of companies you can go through to get the room. these are the policies that are affecting the lives of the people whom we represent. i don't represent many big, multinational corporations. i don't think i have any, as a matter of fact, in my district, but i guess there are some folks around here who have a bunch of them. {time} 1015 mr. speaker, may i inquire how much time remains on both sides? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from georgia has 10 minutes remaining. the gentleman from virginia has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, since i have one speaker remaining, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great state of texas (ms. jackson lee). ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i thank the distinguished gentleman from georgia, and i thank the chairman of the full committee and the author of this bill. i rise in combination of speaking on this bill, but also offering my deepest sympathy to the people of brussels, the people of belgium which, some would say, is the heart of the civic participation of europe--they are certainly dear friends of the united states--though we would mourn any who have been impacted by the dastardly deeds of terrorism. i know in our committee, mr. johnson and mr. goodlatte are working on these issues. i would hope that we could move the no fly for foreign terrorists bill as quickly as possible as we make our way through these issues of determining how we disrupt the ideology and then the actions that result in the deaths of innocent persons. so i offer that. mr. speaker, i am struck by the name of this bill because i don't know who gets smarter. i know that the consumers get poorer and that there are opportunities for victimizing the consumers. this bill does not create equal rules or implement smarter legislation. but if i might take up the comment about the increasing cost of prescription drugs, that is clearly a result of not allowing the ftc to pursue and to proceed because it is our arm of equalizing and balancing the consumer. on this day, when we acknowledge the sixth anniversary of the affordable care act that has brought health insurance to 20 million people, we know that what we need to fix is the rising cost of prescription drugs. so this bill is about attacking the administrative authority of the federal trade commission. it is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally undermine the ftc's independent enforcement authority and ability to prevent anticompetitive mergers. as a law student, i remember in my antitrust classes how the ftc was highlighted as one of the anchors of balance and the anchors of protection of innocent civilians. specifically, if enacted, the smarter act would strip the ftc of power by eliminating the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger cases and by blocking its ability to use its administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction. why is that? the ftc is where you can engage and have discussion. the bill seeks to do so by requiring that the ftc use the same enforcement process as the doj. there is more ability for the little guy to be heard at the ftc. this proposed sweeping change undercuts the ftc's administrative litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and effectively removes a very core and functioning character of the agency, lets more people in the door to express themselves for or against this merger, how it impacts, with less resources needed to get in front of an administrative agency than dealing with the department of justice. moreover, reducing the ftc's independence directly conflicts with congress' intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and policymaking body as a distinct and independent shield from political and executive interference. as enforcers of section 7 of the clayton act, both the ftc and doj have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and acquisitions that substantially lessen competition. that saves money because competition helps save money. these agencies serve to complement each other. why make them the same? they are not twins. based upon historical experience and coordinated development, the ftc serves to protect consumers and consumer spending, health care, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, food safety, among other things. the doj typically assumes a specialized focus on larger corporate industries, like telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, they work together. don't take away the consumers' arm. that is the ftc. this bill takes it away and puts the little guy under and the big guy up. mr. speaker, i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 2745, the standard merger and acquisition reviews through equal rules act--otherwise known as the smarter act. mr. speaker, this bill is not about creating equal rules or implementing ``smarter'' legislation. rather, it is about attacking the administrative authority of the federal trade commission (ftc). h.r. 2745 is an unnecessary measure that would fundamentally undermine the ftc's independent enforcement authority and ability to prevent anti-competitive mergers. as we all know, the ftc was created by congress with the specific intent of creating an independent antitrust enforcement agency and supplemental authority to the department of justice (doj). specifically, if enacted, the smarter act would strip the ftc of its power by eliminating [[page h1565]] the agency's authority to enforce antitrust laws in larger merger cases, and by blocking its ability to use its administrative proceedings to stop a harmful merger transaction. the bill seeks to do so by requiring that the ftc use the same enforcement process as the doj. this proposed sweeping change undercuts the ftc's administrative litigation process for contested mergers or acquisitions and effectively removes the very core and functioning character of this agency. moreover, reducing the ftc's independence directly conflicts with congress's intent in creating this antitrust enforcement agency and policymaking body as distinct and independent shield from political and executive interference. as enforcers of section 7 of the clayton act, both the ftc and the doj have the authority and responsibility to prohibit mergers and acquisitions that would ``substantially lessen competition'' or ``tend to create a monopoly''. under this enforcement authority, these agencies serve to complement each other, and have developed over the years to specialize in particular industries and markets. based upon historical experience and coordinated developments, the ftc serves to protect consumers and consumer spending--e.g., healthcare, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, and certain high-tech industries like computer technology and internet services. whereas, the doj typically assumes a specialized focus on larger corporate industries--e.g., telecommunications, banks, railroads, and airlines. thus, while the ftc and the doj have operated with a shared responsibility of enforcing federal antitrust laws, these two federal agencies are unique and each retain exclusive authority of certain conduct. serving as joint enforcement agencies for over 100 years, the ftc and doj rely upon each other to coordinate agency jurisdiction and harmonized standards and practices. the smarter act is simply unnecessary as it fails to put forth any meaningful effort to enhance or rectify any expressed concerns governing these longstanding agency operations. in particular, in 2002 congress sought to review and amend antitrust laws and policies in light of changing economy and rise in technological advances. in 2007 a report issued by the antitrust modernization commission (amc) set forth specific recommendations for the ftc to eliminate real or perceived disparities in the review process for merger transactions. according to the amc, congress should seek to ensure that the same or comparable standard is used when seeking a preliminary injunction against a potentially anticompetitive transaction. however, the smarter act goes beyond this recommendation and seeks to chip away and carve out the entire administrative adjudication authority of the ftc. in order to identify potential violations of the clayton act, the ftc and the doj review proposed merger transactions pursuant to the hart- scott-rodino antitrust improvements act (the hsr act), which provides advance notice and sets forth guidelines on large merger and acquisition transactions. the heart of this concern is the alternate means in which the ftc and the doj carry out their enforcement role during this hsr pre-merger process. namely, h.r. 2745 is curiously motivated by the preliminary injunction process utilized by the ftc and the doj to halt proposed transactions that would violate the clayton act if completed. additionally, the doj typically consolidates the preliminary and permanent injunction proceedings, while the ftc typically only pursues the preliminary injunction. while some argue that proposed transactions reviewed through the ftc would be treated more leniently than those reviewed through the doj, this assertion was not fully substantiated by the amc. the pre-merger review process and the injunction standards utilized by the ftc and the doj are the very procedural steps that characterize and distinguish the respective enforcement roles of these agencies. this supposed area of concern addresses only a small fraction of proposed transactions, as the vast majority of merger and acquisition proposals are found to not be in violation of the clayton act during the review process. the ftc and the doj review over a thousand merger filings every year. yet 95% of those merger filings present no competitive issues or challenged transactions. as reported by the american antitrust institute (aai), the overall concerns purported by the bill's sponsors are simply without foundation. in contrast, the overall work of the ftc has an incredible impact on american consumers, communities and corporations and will be severely impacted if disrupted. as highlighted by the ftc chairwoman edith ramirez in her testimony before the house judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform, commercial and antitrust law, the ftc prioritizes the protection of consumers and the prevention of anticompetitive market practices. in fact, the ftc exists to ensure fair competition and to prevent enormous concentrations of economic power that hurts consumers and small businesses. for example: in the past year, the ftc has challenged over 28 mergers, (although in most it was able to negotiate a remedy to allow the merger to proceed). at the consumer level in my home state of texas, the ftc secured an $82,000 settlement against an auto-dealer found in violation of the fair credit reporting act in september 2015. also last year, the ftc ordered the largest divestiture ever in a supermarket merger, requiring albertsons and safeway to sell 168 supermarkets in 130 local markets throughout several states, ensuring that communities continue to benefit from competition among their local supermarkets. the ftc has also taken an aggressive stance on stopping anticompetitive mergers and conduct in the healthcare market by halting such practices through administrative litigation. in september 2015, the ftc secured a $1.1 million settlement to consumers who lost money to a health insurance telemarketing scam. and in the last two years, the ftc took action in 13 pharmaceutical mergers, ordering divestitures to preserve competition for drugs that treat diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, as well as widely used generic medications like oral contraceptives and antibiotics. just last week on march 18, 2016, after a thoroughly vetted investigation, the ftc approved a final order preserving competition among outpatient dialysis clinics in laredo, texas. that is, the ftc cleared u.s. renal care, inc.'s (the country's third largest outpatient dialysis provider) $640 million purchase of dialysis competitor dsi renal, on the condition that three of dsi's outpatient clinics in laredo, texas, be handed over to a third party. absent this agreed divestiture, the acquisition would have led to a significant increase in market concentration and anti-competitive effects. the likely result, according to the ftc, would have included the elimination of direct competition between u.s. renal care and dsi renal, reduced incentives to improve services or quality for dialysis patients, and increased ability for the merged company to unilaterally increase prices. notably, the doj has also been successful in securing investigations and halting suspected harmful merger practices on a much larger scale (in the health care and airline industry as of recent). in june 2015, the doj put pressure on several multibillion dollar health insurers seeking to engage in large merger transactions with near certain suppression of market competition in the healthcare industry. in august 2015, the doj issued civil investigative demands on several major us airlines seeking to halt any potential unlawful mergers. these cases demonstrate the need for continued protection of the ftc and its ability to effectively carry out injunctions on harmful merger and acquisition activities, as well as anticompetitive business conduct that harms consumers and restrains market activity. the ability of the ftc to function independently is a necessary function to the success of both the ftc and the doj. the far-reaching and elusive smarter act fails keep the foundational integrity of these agencies and should be opposed. i urge all members to vote against this serious threat to our fundamental protections of consumers and fair economic competition. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time to close. it is not often that i come to the floor to argue a bill and to debate and nobody on the other side shows up to participate in the debate. i have been feeling kind of lonely over here. i guess that people are too embarrassed on the other side to come here and defend this legislation at this particular time, as we get ready to depart for what will be just about 3 weeks, while we are leaving dangling and hanging important issues, like a budget for this country that was promised to us back at the beginning of the year. it was supposed to be regular order. it was supposed to be that we are going to do a budget. after the budget is done and we have our top lines and bottom lines in place, then we will embark upon the appropriations process and we will pass all of [[page h1566]] the 12 appropriations bills for the first time in years and we will get back to regular order around here. they can't even produce enough votes to pass a budget. so what do we do then? we revert to trying to protect and coddle and make things easy for big multinational corporations that want to get bigger. they want to get bigger so that they can get a lock on the market, they have no competition, and then they can set whatever price they want to set and the american people are left having to pay. what can you do when you need your prescription medication and there is no competition, no other similar drug, and you only have one player in the room; therefore, you have to pay whatever they are holding you over the barrel for. the american people are sick and tired and they are angry about having been held over a barrel year after year after year as this congress continues to coddle and protect and make things good for big business. well, what about the working people of this country? when are we going to do something about making sure that they don't have to pay these increased bills that they would have to pay for things like hotel rooms, insurance, medical care, prescription drugs, nursing homes, and food? i don't even want to talk about the price of gas that is going to go up this summer. despite the fact that we have a glut in the oil market, you are going to be seeing your gas prices rise. why? because you are getting out on the road and trying to go on vacation. it is getting more and more difficult to do that because wages haven't gone up. so this congress continues to make it easy for big corporations to increase their profits while doing nothing to raise wages for the regular working people of this country. now we are getting ready to go on another 3-week district work period. i have a lot of work to do in the district trying to explain to the people of my district why we are not getting down to business and doing the things that they expect this congress to do. mr. speaker, i would ask that my colleagues in this body oppose the smarter act and do what is right for the american people. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time to close. let's look at the arguments, the straw men that have been set up by the other party claiming that this legislation does a manner of things that it simply does not do. first, they say enacting the smarter act only benefits large companies that wish to merge, but the smarter act protects small and midsize companies which also come under the federal trade commission's scrutiny. this legislation is not designed to help big companies get bigger. indeed, large companies have the resources to hire the lawyers, economists, lobbyists, and other regulatory professionals to wrestle with the ftc. it is the small- and medium-size companies that would benefit from a fair process and an assurance that they would have their day in court. the ftc does not always focus its attention on the large companies. in fact, a wall street journal article from 2013 documents how the ftc pursued anticompetitive practices of the music teachers national association, a nonprofit with about a dozen employees. in short, this nonprofit was a collection of piano teachers. so if you think the ftc only engages with conglomerates, you are mistaken. they will even prosecute your after-school piano teacher. the smarter act ensures that, if the ftc does focus its efforts on piano teachers, on the small- and medium-size companies, they will have the benefit of a fair process. then they make the argument that the smarter act will make it more difficult for antitrust enforcement agencies to stop a merger, but the smarter act only changes the process. it does not have any substantive impact on merger reviews. the smarter act does not make any substantive changes to antitrust law. rather, the legislation only standardizes the process between the two antitrust enforcement agencies. the witnesses at the committee hearings on the smarter act testified that the legislation only affects the process and not the substantive standard. as deborah garza, former chairwoman of the antitrust modernization commission stated: no one on the amc believed at the time, and i do not believe today, that this legislation would make it difficult or impossible for the ftc commission to do its job. the justice department has done very well in pursuing its merger enforcement agenda working with the standards that apply to it. and i firmly believe that the ftc can do so as well. indeed, even the current department of justice assistant attorney general for the antitrust division stated: i do not think there is a practical difference in how the courts assess the factual and legal basis for enjoining a merger challenged by the ftc on the one hand and the department on the other. let me also quote from a letter written by 15 leading antitrust professors who wrote to congress expressing their support for the smarter act: the ftc is a very impressive agency that plays a valuable role in antitrust enforcement. the smarter act does nothing to undermine the ftc's authority. it simply ensures that the merger review processes and standards are equally applied to merger parties, regardless of which agency reviews the transaction. the gentleman from new jersey complained about what was going on with the review of proposed mergers by health insurance companies. guess what. who is doing those reviews? not the ftc. the department of justice. it doesn't make any sense. what does make sense is that there are lots of companies going through lots of things caused, in part, by obamacare forcing healthcare providers, insurance companies, and others to look at mergers and acquisitions. when they do so, the public should have the right to know that justice is being done. this is not about big business or small business. this is about making sure that the laws are fairly and equally applied. when that happens, we should have this legislation at hand so that we have the assurance that we are going to have justice done. the ftc should operate by the same merger review processes and standards that the department of justice does. i believe in the vigorous prosecution of antitrust practices and transactions by the department of justice and the ftc. i would not support the smarter act if i thought that it would disadvantage our antitrust enforcement agencies. the congressional record demonstrates that the smarter act only makes the process more fair and predictable while providing the antitrust enforcement agencies with the same powers to prosecute antitrust practices. {time} 1030 the smarter act is a commonsense process reform that ensures fairness and parity in the narrow field of merger reviews. the bill was recommended to congress by a bipartisan commission and is supported by former top department of justice antitrust enforcement officials and past and present ftc commissioners of both political parties. this legislation will help america continue to serve as a leader and innovator in competition law, and i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. conyers. mr. speaker, h.r. 2745, the ``standard merger and acquisition reviews through equal rules act of 2015'' or smarter act, would require the federal trade commission to use the same merger enforcement procedures as the justice department's antitrust division for proposed mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and other similar transactions. i oppose this flawed bill for several reasons. most importantly, h.r. 2745--by weakening the commission's independence--undermines congress's original intent in creating the federal trade commission in the first place. for good reasons that are still relevant today, congress established the commission to be an independent administrative agency. although the sherman antitrust act of 1890 empowered the justice department to enforce antitrust laws, congress determined that more needed to be done to address the wave of mergers and anti-competitive corporate abuses that continued notwithstanding the enactment of that act. [[page h1567]] accordingly, congress created the commission in 1914 as an independent body of experts charged with developing antitrust law and policy free from political influence, and particularly executive branch interference. to this end, congress specifically gave the commission broad administrative powers to investigate and enforce laws to stop unfair methods of competition as well as the authority to use an administrative adjudication process to develop policy expertise, rather than requiring the commission to try cases before a generalist federal judge. yet, rather than strengthening the commission's independence and enforcement authority, the smarter act does the opposite. of greatest concern is the bill's elimination of the administrative adjudication process for merger cases under section 5(b) of the federal trade commission act. by doing so, the smarter act would effectively transform the commission from an independent administrative agency into just another competition enforcement agency indistinguishable from the justice department and, thereby, arguable redundant. the commission's administrative authority is key to its distinctive role as an independent administrative agency. but the smarter act--by eliminating the commission's administrative authority--opens the door for the ultimate elimination of the commission. and, you do not just have to take my word for it. former republican commission chairman william kovacic, while expressing support for the bill's harmonization of preliminary injunction standards, says that the ``rest of the smarter act is rubbish.'' he continued, ``let me put it this way: behind the rest of [the smarter act] is the fundamental question of whether you want the federal trade commission involved in competition law.'' similarly, current commission chairwoman edith ramirez observes that the bill would have ``far-reaching immediate effects'' and ``fundamentally alter the nature and function of the commission, as well as the potential for significant unintended consequences.'' consumers union also opposes the smarter act not only because it is completely unnecessary, but also because the bill could ``create unintended hurdles to effective and sound enforcement'' and ``set the stage for further tinkering--both of which risk undermining what is now a coherent, consistent, well-established, familiar enforcement procedure within the'' commission. finally, the smarter act is problematic because it may apply to conduct well-beyond large mergers, which could further hinder the commission's effectiveness. in particular, the smarter act would eliminate the commission's authority to use administrative adjudications not just for the largest mergers, but for non-merger activity, like a ``joint venture'' or ``similar transaction.'' i recognize that the bill's authors have tried in good faith to respond to some of the concerns expressed by me and by the commission during the last congress and i appreciate those efforts. moreover, i recognize that the commission itself last year changed its procedural rules to make it easier to end the use of administrative litigation where it loses a preliminary injunction proceeding in court. i continue to have concerns, however, about the bill's prohibition against the commission's administrative litigation authority with respect to all merger cases. accordingly, i must oppose the smarter act, even in its rewritten form, and i urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to h.r. 2745. the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate has expired. pursuant to house resolution 653, the previous question is ordered on the bill. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. motion to recommit mr. doggett. mr. speaker, i have a motion at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. is the gentleman opposed to the bill? mr. doggett. i am. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the motion to recommit. the clerk read as follows: mr. doggett moves to recommit the bill (h.r. 2745) to the committee on the judiciary, with instructions to report the bill back to the house forthwith with the following amendment: at the end of the bill, add the following: sec. 5. protecting consumers against high prescription drug costs. (a) this act and the amendments made by this act shall not apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs. (b) the clayton act (15 u.s.c.12 et seq.) and federal trade commission act (15 u.s.c. 45 et seq.) as in effect immediately before the date of the enactment of this act shall apply to mergers that would unreasonably increase the costs of pharmaceutical drugs. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. mr. doggett. mr. speaker, for many months now so many of us democrats here in the house have been pleading with our republican colleagues to recognize that there is a very serious cost to the american people of prescription price gouging; such a serious matter that, overwhelmingly, in the fall, when the kaiser family foundation surveyed healthcare concerns of americans, the number one issue was soaring, unaffordable prescription drugs. we have not been very successful in getting their attention on this just to recognize the severity of the problem--not even getting to the point of agreeing on what legislative action this congress, this administration might take in order to address this problem. we got another indication of the severity of the problem and the way that people across america are being impacted by the republican failure to address prescription price gouging in the latest survey done this year by aarp, their rxprice watch report, which found the average retail price among 622 prescription medicines that are widely used by seniors more than doubled from less than $6,000 in 2006 to over $11,000 in 2013. that is an incredible increase. it is not just seniors who are impacted, but working families, people all over the united states, by the fact that prescription drug prices are rising much faster than the cost of living and other health care. now, we have been asking for months that republicans recognize the severity of this problem. i have asked in the committee on ways and means. we cannot even get a hearing on the subject. our colleagues have asked, in the commerce committee, how about a hearing to look at what is happening to the american people on these outrageous prescription price increases that just keep increasing and increasing? the commerce committee has refused to hold a hearing on it. the committee on appropriations has been asked to review and consider this problem. they won't hold a hearing on it. the committee on oversight and government reform, under the leadership of elijah cummings as the ranking democrat, asked for a subpoena. finally--and it is appropriate for this bill, they call it the smarter act, and republicans are always so much better at naming their legislation than what is in it--we had a smart aleck who got subpoenaed, the guy who thought it was okay to raise the price of an over 60-year-old drug by over 5,000 percent in 1 day, having a big impact on people who needed it for reduced immunity from any number of kinds of treatments, a 5,000 percent increase, and they at least were willing to get him over video to make his various smart-aleck remarks about his ability to do that. competition by itself is not solving the problem with the soaring cost of prescription drugs. but trying to maintain competition, if republicans won't recognize how endangered so many americans are by prescription price gouging, we ought not to go backwards, and that is what i fear this bill would do. let me give you a precise example. on november 18, the federal trade commission, which would be impacted by this bill, approved a final order that was concerned with the merger on generic drugs that treat certain types of ulcers and thyroid conditions. this is the merger, an $8 billion merger between endo international and par pharmaceuticals. the ftc was concerned about the effect on competition and raising prices and gouging consumers even more than is occurring already. i do not want to impair in any way their ability to initiate litigation, to be involved, to see that competition remains--to the limited extent it is now--and not see seniors or working families with a sick child or anyone who gets a sad diagnosis of a life-threatening disease and then finds themselves facing financial ruin even if they have insurance, to see [[page h1568]] one of the few tools we have to deal with these anticompetitive provisions eliminated by this bill. this is the last amendment on the bill. it will not send the bill back to committee. it will at least preserve this one narrow area. if republicans won't recognize the problem, at least don't go make it worse. they could be bringing up bills to this floor like the one that had bipartisan support about 8 or 9 years ago. former representative john dingell had a bill so that we would begin to have medicare negotiate prices with these pharmaceutical companies. twenty-four republicans even joined us. that is the kind of bipartisan action we need. at least approve this motion to recommit. let the bill move forward, but without gouging consumers on prescription drug prices even more than they are today. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, there is no question that, because of obamacare and government regulation, the cost of prescription drugs is going up--and going up too fast. we definitely need to reform our healthcare system, starting with repealing obamacare and putting in place real patient-centered reforms to our healthcare system, but that is not what this legislation is about today. the smarter act is predicated on a very simple notion: the results of an antitrust merger review should not be dependent on which antitrust enforcement agency happens to review the deal. the outcome should not be determined by the flip of an agency coin. the smarter act is a process reform that ensures that all parties have their day in court and are subject to the same standards, regardless of which antitrust enforcement agency reviews their merger. the motion to recommit defeats this simple reform by carving out an exception for one area. why, if we are seeking justice, why, if we are seeking a fair standard for all people before these antitrust review agencies, would we take this particular area and say, no, we are not going to have a consistent standard for reviewing something that the gentleman feels is so important. we all feel that is very important, and that is why we all should oppose this motion to recommit and vote for the underlying bill. i urge my colleagues to vote against the motion. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion to recommit. the question was taken; and the speaker pro

clause 9 of rule xx, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and the motion to suspend the rules and agree to house resolution 658. the vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 174, nays 235, not voting 24, as follows: [roll no. 136] yeas--174 adams aguilar beatty becerra beyer bishop (ga) bonamici

Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Americans know that liberal media bias is a major problem in our country. A recent Rasmussen poll found that Americans believe media bias is a bigger problem in politics than large campaign contributions. It also found that a large majority of Americans, 66 percent, believe the news media has too much power and influence over government decisions. A Media Research Center analysis of The New York Times provides an example. MRC found that, since last August, The New York Times has never characterized Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders as being hard- line or hard-left.

MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is one of the most important pieces of legislation in a generation. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million people have gained health insurance coverage. As this chart shows, the percentage of the population without health insurance is now under 10 percent. That is the first time this has happened in our Nation's history. Just look at it. The uninsurance rate was steady for many, many years. Then, after the Affordable Care Act was passed, it dropped like a stone.

CREC-2016-03-23-pt1-PgH1574,CREC-2016-03-23,114,WHEN THE LAW DOES NOT FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1574-H1579] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WHEN THE LAW DOES NOT FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa). The Life and Legacy of Isaac Lowe Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for yielding to me so I may pay tribute to a great, stellar woman from northern California. This can't be done in a 1-minute speech, so a little extra time is very, very fitting in recognition of her work and her life. In rising today, I join with many northstate residents in honoring the life and legacy of Isaac Lowe, an incredible woman and a prominent civil rights leader, who passed away just a few weeks ago in Redding, California. She was born in 1921 in Wharton, Texas. Isaac was the second youngest of nine children, learning early the importance of hard work. She attended Tillotson Business College in Austin, Texas, and Prairie View A&M in Prairie View. It was during a visit to check up on a sick friend in California when she met her future husband, Vernon Lowe, whom she married soon after and started her family in Redding, California. Being an African American woman in the 1940s, unfortunately, racism was no stranger to Isaac. Despite holding a business degree, she was denied jobs because employers chose to judge her skin color rather than her impressive credentials. Isaac did not give up. She started a catering business in Redding, and she eventually became the first Black woman to be hired by the County of Shasta, working in social services for 17 years and helping others. However, Isaac's most noble work was through her plight to advance racial equality in her own neighborhood. Upon first moving to Redding, all but one of the Black families lived on the same street and were segregated from the community. This was a status quo that she didn't accept. Isaac joined her husband in founding the Redding chapter of the NAACP and began her 65-year journey of advocating for civil rights and worked very hard in order to hold onto that charter of the NAACP when times got a little leaner back in the seventies. She lobbied city and county lawmakers for safe and affordable housing for Black families. She worked with local school officials for the equal treatment of Black children in the community's mainly White schools. She fought for fairness and justice under the law for all citizens in the judicial system. She raised funds and successfully sought approval from city hall for the construction of the only Martin Luther King, Jr., community center between Sacramento and Oregon at that time. It was her compassionate advocacy and her resiliency that helped change Shasta County for the better. Some of her most notable accomplishments included being the first Black woman to serve on Shasta County's grand jury, where she served as a founding member of the Shasta County Citizens Against Racism and was awarded the Redding Citizen of the Year in 1992. Her proudest moment was in getting the Redding City Council members to recognize Martin Luther King Day as a holiday. Her legacy speaks volumes of the person she was and of the impact she had on so many lives. One of the anecdotes I know about her informally is that she was fairly commonly referred to as the ``Rosa Parks of Redding, California.'' She was a deeply caring friend, a loving wife and mother, and a selfless advocate. I had the chance to meet Isaac personally on different occasions-- some positive and one, actually, a very negative occasion, but it was made positive by how the community responded to a very ugly racial incident that took place against a Black family in their home. Many of us in the community joined together in a march in solidarity, protesting, that we were not going to tolerate this in our community in northern California. Isaac was there, being strong but also being that smiling, positive voice. You could see her strength. You could also see the light shining from within her as she advocated for what was right for everybody, really, at the end of the day. If we had more people like her and if we had more harmony instead of the divisiveness that we see so badly affecting this country today, we would be much better off. Northern California has lost a gem, but her legacy will live on, and we all recognize that. I am honored to be able to note that here today on the U.S. House floor and to properly show that. Her legacy even lives on in the papers she published and that are right over here in the Library of Congress, which note some of her work in the past for the NAACP. Indeed, it is a rich legacy that reaches all the way to Washington, D.C. I appreciate my colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for allowing me to make this special tribute to Isaac Lowe today. Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from California (Mr. LaMalfa). I did not realize I should have been joining in that tribute with the gentleman. Her being born in Wharton, Texas, and going to college in Texas, we share her as a real gem that the Lord provided to both of us. I thank the gentleman for sharing that with us. Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of being allowed to attend oral arguments at the Supreme Court, and I appreciate their staff and their accomodation. Not everybody over there recognizes that there are three independent, coequal branches of government the way the Founders intended, but I am extremely grateful for those who do, and we afford the mutual respect between us. That is a good thing. So, to the clerk of the Court and to Perry and others, I thank you for your accomodation. I am a member of the Supreme Court Bar, which allows attorneys, as far as seating, to come sit in front of the bar, on the side of the bar with the litigants, and to get a real ringside seat--actually, inside the ring. The case today was, actually, a consolidation of a number of cases. Probably most well-known--probably that should be most well-known--was the Little Sisters of the Poor. We had representatives from East Texas Baptist University in my district in Marshall, Texas. It is just a super school. They are a religious school, and they are not ashamed, because they are East Texas Baptist University, to teach what religious convictions inform them are the right things to do. They follow the law. The problem is when the law does not follow the Constitution, and that is what has gotten us into the problem that was faced today and is being faced at the Supreme Court. It is amazing. I was telling a group here just recently that, in east Texas, we call it ``common sense,'' but when I get to Washington, we usually just [[Page H1575]] have to call it ``sense'' because it is not common at all. I found that to be the case at the Supreme Court during oral arguments. I do have great sympathy for all of the eight remaining Justices in this regard. {time} 1200 Once the Supreme Court issues a ruling that clearly violates the Constitution, for all who truly have eyes and truly have ears to hear not clouded by secular humanism, but informed by the Constitution's words itself, then they see that, when a court rules against the Constitution, violating the Constitution by its very ruling, it creates a terribly difficult situation for itself. Because once the bold, visible lines that are spelled out in the Constitution are violated and erased, the Court is charged with an ongoing impossible task of trying to find a place to redraw those lines. Now, it is unfortunate that some of the Justices--in fact, four of them--kept trying to draw a line in a manner that was not before the Court. They showed themselves to be not necessarily very able jurists who loved justice, but, in fact, very experienced politicians. Because politicians know, if you are wrong on an issue and somebody brings up the issue about which you are wrong, the thing to do is change the subject and make it about something that you are not wrong about. You point to something that is a very difficult question and say that that is a very difficult question and, as good magicians do, divert the attention away from the wrong that you have already done and that you are about to complicate. Mr. Speaker, the wrong about which I speak was the violation by Congress coupled with the violation by the Supreme Court itself. For the first time in our Nation's history, having the United States Federal Government with all its powers, its guns, its ability to take people's homes--well, that is the IRS. Most folks can't take homes. But to just wreak havoc on the well-being of a family, of a business, the Federal Government says for the first time: You have to purchase a product. It is required. There is nothing in the Constitution that either allows or encourages the United States Government to order all American citizens to buy a product. As we went through discussion on ObamaCare back during 2009 until it passed in 2010, at first, the President and his minions were saying that, well, clearly this is not a tax. It was a mandate. It says: You must buy a product and, if you don't comply with our Federal order to buy this product, this health insurance--and it has to be what we say health insurance is, not some idea you have--we will dictate what the health insurance is, and you have to provide it. If you don't, it is not a tax. There is a penalty for violating the law, the mandatory obligation that we have imposed on every American. Well, nothing allows that and many things prohibit it. Over the years, Members of Congress and even the Supreme Court and Presidents have used the Commerce Clause, that we have the right to control interstate commerce, as the basis for which to get involved in matters of commerce that lie within a State. In this case, Chief Justice Roberts in this part of the opinion very correctly states that, if you allow the Federal Government to say we have jurisdiction to mandate people buy health insurance and not just any health insurance. It has to have the things in it that we dictate, then there is no place you could ever draw a line and say the Commerce Clause does not allow for this and ultimately decided that, under the Commerce Clause, ObamaCare was unconstitutional. Simply citing the fact that everybody, at some point, seeks health care--and most people have some form of health insurance at some point--that does not give the Federal Government the right to come in and take over and even dictate the purchase of a product. We had some in this room and at the other end of this building in the Senate who furthered the argument that this is old news, that the Government has been able to do this for many years. It is called car insurance or automobile insurance. Governments have been requiring insurance and penalizing if you didn't buy insurance for years. This is not a new concept. The trouble is that was not an appropriate comparison at all. For one thing, that is activity within the State. It was not the Federal Government that required an insurance policy. And there was no mandate that everyone within a State had to have that car insurance. Courts have long held that driving on a highway built by the State or Federal Government or county is a privilege. You do not have a constitutional right to drive a car on a government road. But if you choose to drive a car, a vehicle, on a government road, in that case, then you must have insurance. The difference is driving on a road is a privilege. In the case of ObamaCare, the Federal Government said just breathing, walking around living or even lying prostrate in your bed, even if you are confined to your bed--it doesn't matter--just being a living person we will say under our Constitution is a privilege that the government giveth and the government taketh away. Therefore, we are saying that, if you are going to exist, breathe, live, you must have health insurance, and not just any health insurance. It has to have the provisions we say and those will not necessarily include the things you need in your life. We, as the omniscient, ubiquitous government--of course, it may be more ubiquitous than we know--we have a right to tell you what is good for you and what isn't. Once the government can tell you what you have to have or have not in the way of health care, they have the right to control your life. So it was interesting, for one thing, that, in this case, the government had conceded that these were sincerely, deeply held religious beliefs of all the plaintiffs. So that was not an issue. It was not an issue like some people who were trying to dodge the draft, except for religious purposes when sometimes it was and sometimes it was not. It was conceded in this case all of the deeply held religious beliefs were very sincere by the litigants. I heard something I don't know that I have heard before in a Supreme Court argument when Justice Sotomayor made a statement of fact about the case. One of the litigants who may not have been politically astute, but, apparently, accurate, said that, factually, Justice Sotomayor, that is just not the case. That is just not true here. Where four of the Justices showed incredible aptitude for being politicians and not Justices, they diverted attention--as I said, good magicians do this. Good politicians do this. They diverted attention away from the real problem and diverted away from the actual question before the Court and kept digging and pointing to a question that was not before the Court. That point was that the four Justices kept wanting to talk about objections to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. They kept wanting to talk about the difficulty in drawing lines, that: ``Gee, what do we do if the plaintiffs or the defendants''--the litigants in the particular case--subjects would probably be more accurate under ObamaCare--the subjects of the United States--it used to be U.S. citizens--``are not objecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs?'' That has come up in cases before where someone would say: ``I believe my religious belief is so personal. You should not make me object on the basis of religious beliefs because then I would have to reveal what my religious beliefs are and that is none of your business. So we object to objecting.'' So the four most liberal Justices kept wanting to talk about: ``But where do we draw the line in this issue if there is an objection to objecting on the basis of religious grounds?'' The able attorneys for the American subjects to the fast-growing monarchy here in the United States kept trying to bring them back to what was before the Court: ``Justices, none of these clients, none of the litigants, object to objecting on religious grounds. They have no problem with objecting on religious grounds. They have objected on [[Page H1576]] religious grounds. They filed objections both administratively and in court when they filed for injunction. They have had no problem objecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. So that is not really an issue.'' Once again, when Justices are in the wrong, they don't want to talk about the issue before the Court. They want to talk about the issue that is not before the Court. Let's talk about how many angels you might could get on the head of a needle. Let's talk about anything but the elephant in the room. The real elephant in the room and the reason for which I have sympathy for all eight Justices is that, once they violated the Constitution by saying ObamaCare was constitutional, they created so many scenarios that are going to be nightmares for the Court to try to figure out where we stop the flood as it overwhelms the rights of Americans. It is just a massive--like that 1950s movie or maybe it was early '60s--``The Blob.'' You just couldn't stop it. It would go out one place and come out another. And that is the problem when the Supreme Court violates the Constitution in the case of ObamaCare, saying: You can dictate to American citizens. You can make them American subjects to this all- powerful, dictatorial Federal Government. You can tell them what to buy. You can punish them for not buying it. And, of course, we know that--although Chief Justice Roberts was exactly right and on point when he said: Gee, if you try to use the Commerce Clause, jurisdiction over interstate commerce, to justify the takeover of health care and a mandate to buy something the Federal Government says you have to buy, then there is no limit ever that can be drawn on the Commerce Clause. {time} 1215 So it is not constitutional under the Commerce Clause. It certainly appeared accurate when Chief Justice Roberts went through an explanation of the initial issue that they had to take up on ObamaCare, and that was the anti-injunction statute, which basically requires that, before a litigant in Federal court can have standing to be before the court and if it involves a tax, then the litigant must be someone against whom the tax has already been levied and the tax has already been paid. Only if the tax has been levied against the litigant and the tax has been paid do the courts recognize standing by that litigant to be before the court to make argument over any complaint. So they had to deal with that issue because not only does a litigant not have standing to even stay in court if they are arguing about a tax and the tax has not been levied and the tax has not been paid, but the Federal court itself has no jurisdiction to even hear the controversy until the tax is levied and the tax is paid. So Chief Justice Roberts had the difficult problem of investigating and ruling on whether or not the mandate and the penalty that comes if you don't purchase what is required by the Federal Government--is that a penalty or is that a tax? Because if it is a tax, the law is very clear. We will have to rule that the plaintiffs do not have standing and their case be thrown out. And, similarly, we will rule that the Court does not have jurisdiction. The case, as it is said in court, is not ripe for litigation. So it will have to be thrown out. If the court found that the penalty imposed by the Federal Government for not being a loyal American subject and buying a product that the monarchy or the growing dictatorship here says you have to buy--if it is a penalty, then you can come to court. We do have jurisdiction, and you do have standing. So Chief Justice Roberts went through and ably explained how Congress called it a penalty. At that time, of course, the Democrats were in the majority here in the House as well as the Senate. The Democratic leadership, the Democratic supporters in favor of ObamaCare, had made it clear this is a penalty. Chief Justice Roberts cited that, that Congress should know better than anyone else whether this is a penalty or it is a tax. Because if it is a penalty, again, the litigant can be here and have standing. We have got jurisdiction. But if it is a tax, we have to throw it out. We can't hear the case, not now. He said Congress should know better than anyone. They decided it was a penalty. Not only that, but it really does appear to be a penalty because ObamaCare says: You have to buy insurance and you have to buy a product we say is okay. You can't buy what you want. You have to buy what we say you must buy. And if you don't do that, we will impose a financial penalty on you. I am hearing more and more young people who are really perplexed: Yes. The government is giving me a subsidy to help me pay for my insurance, but my insurance has 5-, 6-, 7-, $8,000 of a threshold that I have to meet before it ever helps me with a dime of insurance help. So am I better off getting the government subsidy, paying all this money that is really making my life miserable, or should I go ahead and pay the new income tax that I have added on to me for not having insurance as is dictated? I think Chief Justice Roberts came to a proper conclusion. This truly is a penalty. It is not a tax because it is only paid if you violate the mandate that the Federal Government dictated. So, clearly, it is a penalty. So there at page 1415 of the opinion, Chief Justice Roberts concludes: Okay. Congress says it is a penalty. It obviously is a penalty. If you don't want to pay the penalty, then buy the insurance. You won't have the penalty. It is clearly a penalty. Since it is a penalty, the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply. Therefore, the plaintiffs do have standing, and not only do they have standing, but this court has jurisdiction. Now, because it is a penalty and not a tax, we have jurisdiction. So now we will proceed to consider the primary cause before us, whether or not the Federal Government can mandate for the first time in history that all of the American people buy a product that it dictates. Then he went through and determined, if you say the Commerce Clause justifies Federal jurisdiction here, then the Commerce Clause has no limits, has no meaning. And we choose to find that the Commerce Clause has meaning. Therefore, this is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. But, then again, about 40 pages after he says it is not a tax, it is a penalty, Chief Justice Roberts plays the mental gymnastics of arriving at saying: You know what. It turns out this really is not a penalty. It is a tax. And since it is a tax, a majority of us will find that it is constitutional. And so the Federal Government can impose a mandate requiring that all American citizens be loyal subjects, subject to the dictatorship here in Washington, buy whatever product we tell them to buy. And all of that is because the Supreme Court rewrote the law and called it a tax. That is why the Supreme Court is struggling the way it is today. Because when you create an abomination, you violate the Constitution to the extent, you violate your conscience the way it was before it got so clouded with politics. You violate the Constitution and then you create the kind of mess that is before the Supreme Court today. It is incredible to sit and listen to the Supreme Court struggling over this issue of just how far we can go to violate someone's religious beliefs. I didn't hear any one of the Justices refer to the First Amendment, that the government will establish no religion and not violate--or not prohibit the free exercise thereof. My friend, Keith Rothfus, a fellow Member of Congress, was sitting beside me. He got sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court bar today. Keith Rothfus was pointing out that, in one of the prior Supreme Court decisions back in the 1960s, they actually had a footnote where they listed a lot of the religions that they found currently in the United States. It was a fairly full list. But one of the religions in the United States recognized by the Supreme Court in the early 1960s was secular humanism. As Keith Rothfus and I agreed, we have now come to the point where we are violating the First Amendment of the Constitution. And not only are we violating the restraint against the Federal Government prohibiting the free exercise of religion, as it is doing for East Texas Baptist University, Houston Baptist University, Little Sisters of the Poor, [[Page H1577]] so many organizations that are religious in nature, but they have violated the part that said we will have no establishment of religion. The Founders were thinking specifically about the Church of England and how the King didn't like the way the Vatican was ruling. And so he just created his own church, the Church of England. He said: Everybody has got to participate in my church now. They didn't want that to ever happen where the government of the land could dictate the religion that people had to practice. Yet, that is what the Supreme Court has now done because it has now recognized secular humanism--not just recognized, but established secular humanism--as the State-sponsored religion in America. With the ruling last summer, the Supreme Court, in effect, said: Since the 1960s, we have been limiting people's ability to use the word God, to pray to God, to read God's word, the Bible. We have been prohibiting that for 40 or so years, 50 years maybe, and we have been protecting what Moses said was the Word of God and what Jesus said was the Word of God for far too long. They basically established secular humanism as the official religion of the United States. By their pronouncement, they were saying to forget what Moses said God said, forget what Jesus said. When Jesus actually was asked about marriage and divorce, he quoted Moses verbatim: A man shall leave his father and mother, a woman leave her home. The two will become one flesh. Then Jesus added, not just quoting Moses as to what Moses said God said about marriage: And what God has joined together, let nobody take apart. The Supreme Court last summer said: The effect of the ruling is not only can you not talk about God publicly or pray or read the Bible, thank God we have speech and debate clause privileges here on this floor where I am actually free to even mention the word God. We pray every day to start our official day here in session. But the Supreme Court ruled, in effect: We are your God. The five of us in the majority of the Supreme Court are now your God. Forget what we said in our prior decisions about marriage. It was not mentioned in the Constitution. Therefore, under the 10th Amendment, it is reserved to the States and the people. Forget the fact that we have talked before about the States will decide what marriage is. Forget our ruling on DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress, where we made very clear that the States only have the right to decide what marriage is. Forget all that. Now we five majority Justices are your God. And forget the fact that we--at least two of us have violated the Federal law in order to reach this decision. Because the Federal law is very clear. If a judge--a Federal judge, magistrate, Justice might have their impartiality--his or her impartiality questioned, then they should disqualify--they shall disqualify themselves from sitting on the case. So we had two Justices. Not only was their opinion and their impartiality in question, there was actually no question that they were not impartial because they had both participated in same-sex wedding ceremonies. And Justice Ginsburg, who is a very nice lady, actually said--as Maureen Dowd pointed out in her article, she emphasized as she pronounced them married by virtue of the laws of the--and she said she really hammered the words--by the Constitution of the United States. {time} 1230 So, clearly, we had Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg perform same- sex marriages before they were not impartial. The law required them to disqualify themselves. I have had some people say: Well, wouldn't it have disqualified any of the other judges if they had ever participated in a marriage between a man and a woman? The answer is very easily and clearly no, because that was the law. The question is: Can a government prohibit same-sex marriage? It was same-sex marriage that was before the court, not can a government prohibit marriage between a man and a woman. If the question had been: Can a government prohibit marriage between a man and a woman, then that might be a different story. But that was not the issue before the court. Two Justices were disqualified. They had made their opinion clearly known in advance. There were other judges who had been asked, as I understand it, to do weddings, but they said: No, that might create a question of my impartiality and would require me to disqualify myself. Well, their participation did certainly disqualify them. They refused to disqualify themselves. So two Justices, as a minimum, were disqualified as they participated in the majority of five. So when you have an unconstitutional ruling by the United States Supreme Court, when the Chief Justice has to commit to the mental gymnastics, the loop-the-loops that he has to try to do to get around saying the mandate to purchase a policy that carries a penalty, is a penalty, and then over here we know he said it is a penalty over there, but now we are saying it is a tax, not a penalty, they created a nightmare for any legitimate judge with a conscience in trying to decide: Now that we have blown apart any constitutional lines, where do we draw the lines now? It is rather tragic. Justice Kennedy was questioning one of the religious litigant's attorneys and made the statement, basically, that the court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that if we give an exemption to a church, we then have to give it to all other religious institutions. Well, that statement deeply troubled me as well because it means that Justice Kennedy does not understand the constitutional prohibition in the First Amendment. You are not on the Supreme Court or in Congress or in the Presidency to ever establish a religion. And it has been established. It is called secular humanism, which the Supreme Court has recognized as a religion. That is what is being established now. You are also not to prohibit the free exercise of religion. When the Supreme Court gets to the point, as Justice Kennedy is, that we on this court--at least a majority--will find it very hard to say that if you are not a part of a church and acting as that church, then you have no right to practice any of your religious beliefs that five of us don't like, that is tragic. I keep coming back to that prophetic statement by Benjamin Franklin when he was asked after the Constitutional Convention by a dear lady: What did you give us? ``A republic, madam, if you can keep it.'' Why would he say ``if you can keep it?'' The reason he said that is--as he knew--the nature of government is to take more and more power and authority over individual rights and individual liberties. And in order to keep a republic, as Ben Franklin called it, you have to teach generation after generation that there are responsibilities that come with citizenship. Because if you don't live up to those responsibilities, you will lose the republic, madam. You can't keep it. We have done a miserable job of teaching the next generation about how you would keep a republic. Instead of being taught, as I was, in school the dangers of socialism, the dangers of communism, and that it always has to result in a dictatorship or a totalitarian government, that it requires people's rights be taken away, our Founders say that we have to recognize these rights are a gift from our Creator, from God, because if we say they are a gift of the government, then what the government giveth, the government can taketh away. We have legislators and judges who have not been properly educated on the manner in which you keep a republic, madam. It really has been heartbreaking when very smart young people ask sincerely: I understand socialism is supposed to be wrong, communism is supposed to be wrong, but it really sounds nice. Can you explain why it would be wrong? Because I don't get it. It sounds nice. As the New Testament Church started out, as the Pilgrims' Compact started out, you bring into the common storehouse, and then you share and share alike. You share from those according to their ability to those according to their need. Of course, more than one parent has explained socialism to their children [[Page H1578]] by saying: Look, you got an A. I know how hard you were working every night doing your homework, but your friend over here got a C. I saw her out partying a lot of times when you were here studying. And she is not maybe quite as smart as you are, so she got a C, you got an A. The socialist notion is that we have to give everybody a B. So we will make this A a B, we will make this C a B, and everybody will feel better for it. Mr. Speaker, I have shared this before, but it was such a lesson to me as an exchange student to the Soviet Union being out at a collective farm. The farmers were sitting in the shade in midmorning, when anybody back home in east Texas knows that--especially in July, like it was-- you start early and you try to finish early before the sun gets too hot. It is midmorning. This is prime time to be working before it gets too hot. And here are all the farmers sitting in the shade in the middle of their village. Trying to use the best Russian I could--I had 2 years, which meant I could converse ably with a 4-year-old--I asked: When do you work out in the field? I couldn't tell what they cultivated and didn't. It all looked brown. None of it looked very good. I would have expected in Texas that those fields would have been green, looking good, and the weeds out. You couldn't tell what was weeds and what wasn't. I said: When do you work out in the field? They laughed, and I thought I must not have translated that right. Then one of them said in Russian, basically: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the field in the sun or if I am here in the shade. So I am here in the shade. I have carried that with me all these years. That is why socialism can't work. It is why socialism or communism--again, bringing all into the common storehouse, share and sharing alike--can never work on this Earth, in this world. Because the only way you will ever have share and share alike, as they found out in the New Testament Church, the only way you can make it work is if you have a totalitarian government that says: you will do what we say. And then there goes your freedoms. So the only way to have the maximum amount of freedom is to have a self-governing republic so people can govern themselves by electing people that they have interviewed, they have read all about, done plenty of research on, and then they come forward on hiring day-- otherwise known as election day--and they vote to hire the person that they want for their public servant. That is the way it is supposed to work. People have not obliged themselves of the need that in order to keep a republic, you have to do the research on the candidates that have applied for your job. You have a requirement, a need, for you to actually come out and vote. Look, I get it. There are so many I have heard from that are disenfranchised voters. They say: We hear about all these people. John Fund has a great book out on the fraud that has been in so many of our modern elections that is not being dealt with, despite what the government says. It is a great book. People find out there is fraud. Since they didn't have to have a photo ID like you have to have to buy cigarettes or alcohol or get on a plane or anything else, you can manipulate the system, you can vote more than one time. My friend from south Texas told me about some of the people who were illegally in the country being approached with voter registration forms, saying: Fill these out. If you don't want to use your own address here, just use one central address. You can all use the same address. Some of them were worried about showing an ID. They will figure out we are illegally in this country and we are not supposed to vote. They were assured: No, no. President Obama's lawyer--Eric Holder at that time--has gotten a judge to rule that they can't require an ID and, therefore, all you have to do is fill this out. But if you don't fill this out, then Republicans are going to take away your welfare, they are going to take away your health care, and they are going to try to make you leave the country. So you have got to fill this out. And even though it is illegal, there is nothing wrong with doing it. You will get the voter registration card in the mail to the address you give them, and then you just go vote and that is all you have to show them. Thankfully, we have voter ID now in Texas. But there are so many people who have been disenfranchised, because they say: There is so much voter fraud going on. Why should I even bother? My vote doesn't count like somebody that votes more than once. We are in grave danger of losing this republic. We are not going to keep it much longer the way we are going. We haven't educated future generations to how you go about keeping a self-governing republic. Some have been miseducated to think socialism, which has failed every single time it has ever been tried--it will always fail. We haven't educated them about the truth of freedom and what is required to keep it. Justice Scalia told a group from my hometown that was here that the reason we are the most free Nation in history is not because we had the best Bill of Rights, but because the Founders didn't trust government. They wanted gridlock. They wanted it as difficult as possible to pass laws, because with the passage of every law is the risk that some freedom will be taken away by the Big Government. {time} 1245 The Founders knew that, and they made it hard to pass laws. That is not a bad thing. It is a good thing. But when he mentioned that the Soviet Union had a better bill of rights than we had, I remembered, I did a paper back in college when I was at Texas A&M. After I had visited the Soviet Union as an exchange student, I wrote a paper on their system. But I had done a paper on their bill of rights, their Constitution. I was shocked at the extent of the rights that were guaranteed to the Soviet Union citizens. I was also surprised to find that, in the early sixties, the Premier, Khrushchev, in the Soviet Union, had set up a commission, because those that had truly been educated on the different forms of government and governing know that, actually, true communism is only when there is no government, that it is like reaching for nirvana. You eventually reach the point where everybody is so sharing and so giving--taking from their ability, giving to the need--they are so giving that you don't even need a government anymore. So Khrushchev set up a commission basically charged with coming up with a plan to reach that ultimate goal where someday there will be no government and we will have true communism in its purest form, no government, everyone giving, sharing, lovingly. And I read that, after a couple of years of that commission trying to figure out, ``How are we ever going to come up with a plan that eventuates in having no government and everybody always sharing equally? How are we going to ever pull that off?'' they couldn't come up with a way to reach that in this world, in this life, and so Khrushchev disbanded the commission. There was no way to get there. They were right. If you are going to have communism or socialism, you are going to have to have a totalitarian government, whether it is an individual dictator or a political group like they have or used to have at the Kremlin. You have got to have ruling autocrats, an oligarch, monarch, in order to force everybody to take from those who have worked hard, according to their ability, and giving to those who either can't work or choose not to work. The only way you can maximize freedoms is when people in the country understand what Franklin understood: you have got a republic if you can keep it. We are not being vigilant to keep our Republic, and that is why so many are desperate now as they vote for a Presidential candidate. And even Christian friends have said, you know, I understand there is a time and place for a David with a slingshot, complete faith in God, and a clear great ability with a slingshot. I know there is a time for that. But right now, our freedoms have been so badly eroded, we are losing the government. We are having people come in and start voting without understanding how you preserve a republic. We are losing the country. We are losing the melting pot that we once were, welcoming people [[Page H1579]] from all over and coming together and being molded into one thing, not a hyphenated American, but an American. We are losing that. You see many voters standing in lines now. They didn't used to ever do this, stand in line for hours. You found people do that in Africa when they are finally afforded an opportunity to vote for the first time in their lives. But now, in America, some people are waiting hours to vote because they see that we have not been vigilant in protecting our Republic, and just as Franklin worried, we are about to lose it. We are already losing it when the government can dictate that individuals buy a product, when the government can say you can only practice your religious beliefs if you are within the confines of a church, but if you are an individual, like the Founders were, who held tightly to their religious beliefs--they talked about it as they passed legislation; they talked about it as they created our Constitution--the Supreme Court is now saying: Secular humanism is what we must have; it is what we demand. And since we are in charge and we are moving toward being socialistic, you have got to have an oligarchy, and we are it. Obviously, they don't say it in those words, but that is what their actions say, and that is why, when a Justice says: Well, this Court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that we were moving the line from beyond a church and extending that line out to other religious institutions--like the Little Sisters of the Poor, these wonderful, superb Christian women who have given their lives doing what Jesus said, ministering to others, feeding His sheep, ministering to their physical needs, their healthcare needs--and the Supreme Court says: We have a lot of trouble. See, they are not actually a church. They are a religious institution, and we are going to have a hard time writing an opinion that moves the line to protect religious opinions. My word, shouldn't have any trouble drawing a line at individuals. Any individual in the United States of America who has a deeply held, sincerely held religious belief, it was meant to be protected, unless it is completely anathema to our Constitution. Sharia law is anathema; and to the extent that some believe they should replace our Constitution with their sharia law, then that is treason if they are here in this country. But otherwise, their religious belief should be recognized, and God help us if the Court doesn't do it right. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1574-H1579] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WHEN THE LAW DOES NOT FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa). The Life and Legacy of Isaac Lowe Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for yielding to me so I may pay tribute to a great, stellar woman from northern California. This can't be done in a 1-minute speech, so a little extra time is very, very fitting in recognition of her work and her life. In rising today, I join with many northstate residents in honoring the life and legacy of Isaac Lowe, an incredible woman and a prominent civil rights leader, who passed away just a few weeks ago in Redding, California. She was born in 1921 in Wharton, Texas. Isaac was the second youngest of nine children, learning early the importance of hard work. She attended Tillotson Business College in Austin, Texas, and Prairie View A&M in Prairie View. It was during a visit to check up on a sick friend in California when she met her future husband, Vernon Lowe, whom she married soon after and started her family in Redding, California. Being an African American woman in the 1940s, unfortunately, racism was no stranger to Isaac. Despite holding a business degree, she was denied jobs because employers chose to judge her skin color rather than her impressive credentials. Isaac did not give up. She started a catering business in Redding, and she eventually became the first Black woman to be hired by the County of Shasta, working in social services for 17 years and helping others. However, Isaac's most noble work was through her plight to advance racial equality in her own neighborhood. Upon first moving to Redding, all but one of the Black families lived on the same street and were segregated from the community. This was a status quo that she didn't accept. Isaac joined her husband in founding the Redding chapter of the NAACP and began her 65-year journey of advocating for civil rights and worked very hard in order to hold onto that charter of the NAACP when times got a little leaner back in the seventies. She lobbied city and county lawmakers for safe and affordable housing for Black families. She worked with local school officials for the equal treatment of Black children in the community's mainly White schools. She fought for fairness and justice under the law for all citizens in the judicial system. She raised funds and successfully sought approval from city hall for the construction of the only Martin Luther King, Jr., community center between Sacramento and Oregon at that time. It was her compassionate advocacy and her resiliency that helped change Shasta County for the better. Some of her most notable accomplishments included being the first Black woman to serve on Shasta County's grand jury, where she served as a founding member of the Shasta County Citizens Against Racism and was awarded the Redding Citizen of the Year in 1992. Her proudest moment was in getting the Redding City Council members to recognize Martin Luther King Day as a holiday. Her legacy speaks volumes of the person she was and of the impact she had on so many lives. One of the anecdotes I know about her informally is that she was fairly commonly referred to as the ``Rosa Parks of Redding, California.'' She was a deeply caring friend, a loving wife and mother, and a selfless advocate. I had the chance to meet Isaac personally on different occasions-- some positive and one, actually, a very negative occasion, but it was made positive by how the community responded to a very ugly racial incident that took place against a Black family in their home. Many of us in the community joined together in a march in solidarity, protesting, that we were not going to tolerate this in our community in northern California. Isaac was there, being strong but also being that smiling, positive voice. You could see her strength. You could also see the light shining from within her as she advocated for what was right for everybody, really, at the end of the day. If we had more people like her and if we had more harmony instead of the divisiveness that we see so badly affecting this country today, we would be much better off. Northern California has lost a gem, but her legacy will live on, and we all recognize that. I am honored to be able to note that here today on the U.S. House floor and to properly show that. Her legacy even lives on in the papers she published and that are right over here in the Library of Congress, which note some of her work in the past for the NAACP. Indeed, it is a rich legacy that reaches all the way to Washington, D.C. I appreciate my colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for allowing me to make this special tribute to Isaac Lowe today. Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from California (Mr. LaMalfa). I did not realize I should have been joining in that tribute with the gentleman. Her being born in Wharton, Texas, and going to college in Texas, we share her as a real gem that the Lord provided to both of us. I thank the gentleman for sharing that with us. Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of being allowed to attend oral arguments at the Supreme Court, and I appreciate their staff and their accomodation. Not everybody over there recognizes that there are three independent, coequal branches of government the way the Founders intended, but I am extremely grateful for those who do, and we afford the mutual respect between us. That is a good thing. So, to the clerk of the Court and to Perry and others, I thank you for your accomodation. I am a member of the Supreme Court Bar, which allows attorneys, as far as seating, to come sit in front of the bar, on the side of the bar with the litigants, and to get a real ringside seat--actually, inside the ring. The case today was, actually, a consolidation of a number of cases. Probably most well-known--probably that should be most well-known--was the Little Sisters of the Poor. We had representatives from East Texas Baptist University in my district in Marshall, Texas. It is just a super school. They are a religious school, and they are not ashamed, because they are East Texas Baptist University, to teach what religious convictions inform them are the right things to do. They follow the law. The problem is when the law does not follow the Constitution, and that is what has gotten us into the problem that was faced today and is being faced at the Supreme Court. It is amazing. I was telling a group here just recently that, in east Texas, we call it ``common sense,'' but when I get to Washington, we usually just [[Page H1575]] have to call it ``sense'' because it is not common at all. I found that to be the case at the Supreme Court during oral arguments. I do have great sympathy for all of the eight remaining Justices in this regard. {time} 1200 Once the Supreme Court issues a ruling that clearly violates the Constitution, for all who truly have eyes and truly have ears to hear not clouded by secular humanism, but informed by the Constitution's words itself, then they see that, when a court rules against the Constitution, violating the Constitution by its very ruling, it creates a terribly difficult situation for itself. Because once the bold, visible lines that are spelled out in the Constitution are violated and erased, the Court is charged with an ongoing impossible task of trying to find a place to redraw those lines. Now, it is unfortunate that some of the Justices--in fact, four of them--kept trying to draw a line in a manner that was not before the Court. They showed themselves to be not necessarily very able jurists who loved justice, but, in fact, very experienced politicians. Because politicians know, if you are wrong on an issue and somebody brings up the issue about which you are wrong, the thing to do is change the subject and make it about something that you are not wrong about. You point to something that is a very difficult question and say that that is a very difficult question and, as good magicians do, divert the attention away from the wrong that you have already done and that you are about to complicate. Mr. Speaker, the wrong about which I speak was the violation by Congress coupled with the violation by the Supreme Court itself. For the first time in our Nation's history, having the United States Federal Government with all its powers, its guns, its ability to take people's homes--well, that is the IRS. Most folks can't take homes. But to just wreak havoc on the well-being of a family, of a business, the Federal Government says for the first time: You have to purchase a product. It is required. There is nothing in the Constitution that either allows or encourages the United States Government to order all American citizens to buy a product. As we went through discussion on ObamaCare back during 2009 until it passed in 2010, at first, the President and his minions were saying that, well, clearly this is not a tax. It was a mandate. It says: You must buy a product and, if you don't comply with our Federal order to buy this product, this health insurance--and it has to be what we say health insurance is, not some idea you have--we will dictate what the health insurance is, and you have to provide it. If you don't, it is not a tax. There is a penalty for violating the law, the mandatory obligation that we have imposed on every American. Well, nothing allows that and many things prohibit it. Over the years, Members of Congress and even the Supreme Court and Presidents have used the Commerce Clause, that we have the right to control interstate commerce, as the basis for which to get involved in matters of commerce that lie within a State. In this case, Chief Justice Roberts in this part of the opinion very correctly states that, if you allow the Federal Government to say we have jurisdiction to mandate people buy health insurance and not just any health insurance. It has to have the things in it that we dictate, then there is no place you could ever draw a line and say the Commerce Clause does not allow for this and ultimately decided that, under the Commerce Clause, ObamaCare was unconstitutional. Simply citing the fact that everybody, at some point, seeks health care--and most people have some form of health insurance at some point--that does not give the Federal Government the right to come in and take over and even dictate the purchase of a product. We had some in this room and at the other end of this building in the Senate who furthered the argument that this is old news, that the Government has been able to do this for many years. It is called car insurance or automobile insurance. Governments have been requiring insurance and penalizing if you didn't buy insurance for years. This is not a new concept. The trouble is that was not an appropriate comparison at all. For one thing, that is activity within the State. It was not the Federal Government that required an insurance policy. And there was no mandate that everyone within a State had to have that car insurance. Courts have long held that driving on a highway built by the State or Federal Government or county is a privilege. You do not have a constitutional right to drive a car on a government road. But if you choose to drive a car, a vehicle, on a government road, in that case, then you must have insurance. The difference is driving on a road is a privilege. In the case of ObamaCare, the Federal Government said just breathing, walking around living or even lying prostrate in your bed, even if you are confined to your bed--it doesn't matter--just being a living person we will say under our Constitution is a privilege that the government giveth and the government taketh away. Therefore, we are saying that, if you are going to exist, breathe, live, you must have health insurance, and not just any health insurance. It has to have the provisions we say and those will not necessarily include the things you need in your life. We, as the omniscient, ubiquitous government--of course, it may be more ubiquitous than we know--we have a right to tell you what is good for you and what isn't. Once the government can tell you what you have to have or have not in the way of health care, they have the right to control your life. So it was interesting, for one thing, that, in this case, the government had conceded that these were sincerely, deeply held religious beliefs of all the plaintiffs. So that was not an issue. It was not an issue like some people who were trying to dodge the draft, except for religious purposes when sometimes it was and sometimes it was not. It was conceded in this case all of the deeply held religious beliefs were very sincere by the litigants. I heard something I don't know that I have heard before in a Supreme Court argument when Justice Sotomayor made a statement of fact about the case. One of the litigants who may not have been politically astute, but, apparently, accurate, said that, factually, Justice Sotomayor, that is just not the case. That is just not true here. Where four of the Justices showed incredible aptitude for being politicians and not Justices, they diverted attention--as I said, good magicians do this. Good politicians do this. They diverted attention away from the real problem and diverted away from the actual question before the Court and kept digging and pointing to a question that was not before the Court. That point was that the four Justices kept wanting to talk about objections to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. They kept wanting to talk about the difficulty in drawing lines, that: ``Gee, what do we do if the plaintiffs or the defendants''--the litigants in the particular case--subjects would probably be more accurate under ObamaCare--the subjects of the United States--it used to be U.S. citizens--``are not objecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs?'' That has come up in cases before where someone would say: ``I believe my religious belief is so personal. You should not make me object on the basis of religious beliefs because then I would have to reveal what my religious beliefs are and that is none of your business. So we object to objecting.'' So the four most liberal Justices kept wanting to talk about: ``But where do we draw the line in this issue if there is an objection to objecting on the basis of religious grounds?'' The able attorneys for the American subjects to the fast-growing monarchy here in the United States kept trying to bring them back to what was before the Court: ``Justices, none of these clients, none of the litigants, object to objecting on religious grounds. They have no problem with objecting on religious grounds. They have objected on [[Page H1576]] religious grounds. They filed objections both administratively and in court when they filed for injunction. They have had no problem objecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. So that is not really an issue.'' Once again, when Justices are in the wrong, they don't want to talk about the issue before the Court. They want to talk about the issue that is not before the Court. Let's talk about how many angels you might could get on the head of a needle. Let's talk about anything but the elephant in the room. The real elephant in the room and the reason for which I have sympathy for all eight Justices is that, once they violated the Constitution by saying ObamaCare was constitutional, they created so many scenarios that are going to be nightmares for the Court to try to figure out where we stop the flood as it overwhelms the rights of Americans. It is just a massive--like that 1950s movie or maybe it was early '60s--``The Blob.'' You just couldn't stop it. It would go out one place and come out another. And that is the problem when the Supreme Court violates the Constitution in the case of ObamaCare, saying: You can dictate to American citizens. You can make them American subjects to this all- powerful, dictatorial Federal Government. You can tell them what to buy. You can punish them for not buying it. And, of course, we know that--although Chief Justice Roberts was exactly right and on point when he said: Gee, if you try to use the Commerce Clause, jurisdiction over interstate commerce, to justify the takeover of health care and a mandate to buy something the Federal Government says you have to buy, then there is no limit ever that can be drawn on the Commerce Clause. {time} 1215 So it is not constitutional under the Commerce Clause. It certainly appeared accurate when Chief Justice Roberts went through an explanation of the initial issue that they had to take up on ObamaCare, and that was the anti-injunction statute, which basically requires that, before a litigant in Federal court can have standing to be before the court and if it involves a tax, then the litigant must be someone against whom the tax has already been levied and the tax has already been paid. Only if the tax has been levied against the litigant and the tax has been paid do the courts recognize standing by that litigant to be before the court to make argument over any complaint. So they had to deal with that issue because not only does a litigant not have standing to even stay in court if they are arguing about a tax and the tax has not been levied and the tax has not been paid, but the Federal court itself has no jurisdiction to even hear the controversy until the tax is levied and the tax is paid. So Chief Justice Roberts had the difficult problem of investigating and ruling on whether or not the mandate and the penalty that comes if you don't purchase what is required by the Federal Government--is that a penalty or is that a tax? Because if it is a tax, the law is very clear. We will have to rule that the plaintiffs do not have standing and their case be thrown out. And, similarly, we will rule that the Court does not have jurisdiction. The case, as it is said in court, is not ripe for litigation. So it will have to be thrown out. If the court found that the penalty imposed by the Federal Government for not being a loyal American subject and buying a product that the monarchy or the growing dictatorship here says you have to buy--if it is a penalty, then you can come to court. We do have jurisdiction, and you do have standing. So Chief Justice Roberts went through and ably explained how Congress called it a penalty. At that time, of course, the Democrats were in the majority here in the House as well as the Senate. The Democratic leadership, the Democratic supporters in favor of ObamaCare, had made it clear this is a penalty. Chief Justice Roberts cited that, that Congress should know better than anyone else whether this is a penalty or it is a tax. Because if it is a penalty, again, the litigant can be here and have standing. We have got jurisdiction. But if it is a tax, we have to throw it out. We can't hear the case, not now. He said Congress should know better than anyone. They decided it was a penalty. Not only that, but it really does appear to be a penalty because ObamaCare says: You have to buy insurance and you have to buy a product we say is okay. You can't buy what you want. You have to buy what we say you must buy. And if you don't do that, we will impose a financial penalty on you. I am hearing more and more young people who are really perplexed: Yes. The government is giving me a subsidy to help me pay for my insurance, but my insurance has 5-, 6-, 7-, $8,000 of a threshold that I have to meet before it ever helps me with a dime of insurance help. So am I better off getting the government subsidy, paying all this money that is really making my life miserable, or should I go ahead and pay the new income tax that I have added on to me for not having insurance as is dictated? I think Chief Justice Roberts came to a proper conclusion. This truly is a penalty. It is not a tax because it is only paid if you violate the mandate that the Federal Government dictated. So, clearly, it is a penalty. So there at page 1415 of the opinion, Chief Justice Roberts concludes: Okay. Congress says it is a penalty. It obviously is a penalty. If you don't want to pay the penalty, then buy the insurance. You won't have the penalty. It is clearly a penalty. Since it is a penalty, the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply. Therefore, the plaintiffs do have standing, and not only do they have standing, but this court has jurisdiction. Now, because it is a penalty and not a tax, we have jurisdiction. So now we will proceed to consider the primary cause before us, whether or not the Federal Government can mandate for the first time in history that all of the American people buy a product that it dictates. Then he went through and determined, if you say the Commerce Clause justifies Federal jurisdiction here, then the Commerce Clause has no limits, has no meaning. And we choose to find that the Commerce Clause has meaning. Therefore, this is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. But, then again, about 40 pages after he says it is not a tax, it is a penalty, Chief Justice Roberts plays the mental gymnastics of arriving at saying: You know what. It turns out this really is not a penalty. It is a tax. And since it is a tax, a majority of us will find that it is constitutional. And so the Federal Government can impose a mandate requiring that all American citizens be loyal subjects, subject to the dictatorship here in Washington, buy whatever product we tell them to buy. And all of that is because the Supreme Court rewrote the law and called it a tax. That is why the Supreme Court is struggling the way it is today. Because when you create an abomination, you violate the Constitution to the extent, you violate your conscience the way it was before it got so clouded with politics. You violate the Constitution and then you create the kind of mess that is before the Supreme Court today. It is incredible to sit and listen to the Supreme Court struggling over this issue of just how far we can go to violate someone's religious beliefs. I didn't hear any one of the Justices refer to the First Amendment, that the government will establish no religion and not violate--or not prohibit the free exercise thereof. My friend, Keith Rothfus, a fellow Member of Congress, was sitting beside me. He got sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court bar today. Keith Rothfus was pointing out that, in one of the prior Supreme Court decisions back in the 1960s, they actually had a footnote where they listed a lot of the religions that they found currently in the United States. It was a fairly full list. But one of the religions in the United States recognized by the Supreme Court in the early 1960s was secular humanism. As Keith Rothfus and I agreed, we have now come to the point where we are violating the First Amendment of the Constitution. And not only are we violating the restraint against the Federal Government prohibiting the free exercise of religion, as it is doing for East Texas Baptist University, Houston Baptist University, Little Sisters of the Poor, [[Page H1577]] so many organizations that are religious in nature, but they have violated the part that said we will have no establishment of religion. The Founders were thinking specifically about the Church of England and how the King didn't like the way the Vatican was ruling. And so he just created his own church, the Church of England. He said: Everybody has got to participate in my church now. They didn't want that to ever happen where the government of the land could dictate the religion that people had to practice. Yet, that is what the Supreme Court has now done because it has now recognized secular humanism--not just recognized, but established secular humanism--as the State-sponsored religion in America. With the ruling last summer, the Supreme Court, in effect, said: Since the 1960s, we have been limiting people's ability to use the word God, to pray to God, to read God's word, the Bible. We have been prohibiting that for 40 or so years, 50 years maybe, and we have been protecting what Moses said was the Word of God and what Jesus said was the Word of God for far too long. They basically established secular humanism as the official religion of the United States. By their pronouncement, they were saying to forget what Moses said God said, forget what Jesus said. When Jesus actually was asked about marriage and divorce, he quoted Moses verbatim: A man shall leave his father and mother, a woman leave her home. The two will become one flesh. Then Jesus added, not just quoting Moses as to what Moses said God said about marriage: And what God has joined together, let nobody take apart. The Supreme Court last summer said: The effect of the ruling is not only can you not talk about God publicly or pray or read the Bible, thank God we have speech and debate clause privileges here on this floor where I am actually free to even mention the word God. We pray every day to start our official day here in session. But the Supreme Court ruled, in effect: We are your God. The five of us in the majority of the Supreme Court are now your God. Forget what we said in our prior decisions about marriage. It was not mentioned in the Constitution. Therefore, under the 10th Amendment, it is reserved to the States and the people. Forget the fact that we have talked before about the States will decide what marriage is. Forget our ruling on DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress, where we made very clear that the States only have the right to decide what marriage is. Forget all that. Now we five majority Justices are your God. And forget the fact that we--at least two of us have violated the Federal law in order to reach this decision. Because the Federal law is very clear. If a judge--a Federal judge, magistrate, Justice might have their impartiality--his or her impartiality questioned, then they should disqualify--they shall disqualify themselves from sitting on the case. So we had two Justices. Not only was their opinion and their impartiality in question, there was actually no question that they were not impartial because they had both participated in same-sex wedding ceremonies. And Justice Ginsburg, who is a very nice lady, actually said--as Maureen Dowd pointed out in her article, she emphasized as she pronounced them married by virtue of the laws of the--and she said she really hammered the words--by the Constitution of the United States. {time} 1230 So, clearly, we had Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg perform same- sex marriages before they were not impartial. The law required them to disqualify themselves. I have had some people say: Well, wouldn't it have disqualified any of the other judges if they had ever participated in a marriage between a man and a woman? The answer is very easily and clearly no, because that was the law. The question is: Can a government prohibit same-sex marriage? It was same-sex marriage that was before the court, not can a government prohibit marriage between a man and a woman. If the question had been: Can a government prohibit marriage between a man and a woman, then that might be a different story. But that was not the issue before the court. Two Justices were disqualified. They had made their opinion clearly known in advance. There were other judges who had been asked, as I understand it, to do weddings, but they said: No, that might create a question of my impartiality and would require me to disqualify myself. Well, their participation did certainly disqualify them. They refused to disqualify themselves. So two Justices, as a minimum, were disqualified as they participated in the majority of five. So when you have an unconstitutional ruling by the United States Supreme Court, when the Chief Justice has to commit to the mental gymnastics, the loop-the-loops that he has to try to do to get around saying the mandate to purchase a policy that carries a penalty, is a penalty, and then over here we know he said it is a penalty over there, but now we are saying it is a tax, not a penalty, they created a nightmare for any legitimate judge with a conscience in trying to decide: Now that we have blown apart any constitutional lines, where do we draw the lines now? It is rather tragic. Justice Kennedy was questioning one of the religious litigant's attorneys and made the statement, basically, that the court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that if we give an exemption to a church, we then have to give it to all other religious institutions. Well, that statement deeply troubled me as well because it means that Justice Kennedy does not understand the constitutional prohibition in the First Amendment. You are not on the Supreme Court or in Congress or in the Presidency to ever establish a religion. And it has been established. It is called secular humanism, which the Supreme Court has recognized as a religion. That is what is being established now. You are also not to prohibit the free exercise of religion. When the Supreme Court gets to the point, as Justice Kennedy is, that we on this court--at least a majority--will find it very hard to say that if you are not a part of a church and acting as that church, then you have no right to practice any of your religious beliefs that five of us don't like, that is tragic. I keep coming back to that prophetic statement by Benjamin Franklin when he was asked after the Constitutional Convention by a dear lady: What did you give us? ``A republic, madam, if you can keep it.'' Why would he say ``if you can keep it?'' The reason he said that is--as he knew--the nature of government is to take more and more power and authority over individual rights and individual liberties. And in order to keep a republic, as Ben Franklin called it, you have to teach generation after generation that there are responsibilities that come with citizenship. Because if you don't live up to those responsibilities, you will lose the republic, madam. You can't keep it. We have done a miserable job of teaching the next generation about how you would keep a republic. Instead of being taught, as I was, in school the dangers of socialism, the dangers of communism, and that it always has to result in a dictatorship or a totalitarian government, that it requires people's rights be taken away, our Founders say that we have to recognize these rights are a gift from our Creator, from God, because if we say they are a gift of the government, then what the government giveth, the government can taketh away. We have legislators and judges who have not been properly educated on the manner in which you keep a republic, madam. It really has been heartbreaking when very smart young people ask sincerely: I understand socialism is supposed to be wrong, communism is supposed to be wrong, but it really sounds nice. Can you explain why it would be wrong? Because I don't get it. It sounds nice. As the New Testament Church started out, as the Pilgrims' Compact started out, you bring into the common storehouse, and then you share and share alike. You share from those according to their ability to those according to their need. Of course, more than one parent has explained socialism to their children [[Page H1578]] by saying: Look, you got an A. I know how hard you were working every night doing your homework, but your friend over here got a C. I saw her out partying a lot of times when you were here studying. And she is not maybe quite as smart as you are, so she got a C, you got an A. The socialist notion is that we have to give everybody a B. So we will make this A a B, we will make this C a B, and everybody will feel better for it. Mr. Speaker, I have shared this before, but it was such a lesson to me as an exchange student to the Soviet Union being out at a collective farm. The farmers were sitting in the shade in midmorning, when anybody back home in east Texas knows that--especially in July, like it was-- you start early and you try to finish early before the sun gets too hot. It is midmorning. This is prime time to be working before it gets too hot. And here are all the farmers sitting in the shade in the middle of their village. Trying to use the best Russian I could--I had 2 years, which meant I could converse ably with a 4-year-old--I asked: When do you work out in the field? I couldn't tell what they cultivated and didn't. It all looked brown. None of it looked very good. I would have expected in Texas that those fields would have been green, looking good, and the weeds out. You couldn't tell what was weeds and what wasn't. I said: When do you work out in the field? They laughed, and I thought I must not have translated that right. Then one of them said in Russian, basically: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the field in the sun or if I am here in the shade. So I am here in the shade. I have carried that with me all these years. That is why socialism can't work. It is why socialism or communism--again, bringing all into the common storehouse, share and sharing alike--can never work on this Earth, in this world. Because the only way you will ever have share and share alike, as they found out in the New Testament Church, the only way you can make it work is if you have a totalitarian government that says: you will do what we say. And then there goes your freedoms. So the only way to have the maximum amount of freedom is to have a self-governing republic so people can govern themselves by electing people that they have interviewed, they have read all about, done plenty of research on, and then they come forward on hiring day-- otherwise known as election day--and they vote to hire the person that they want for their public servant. That is the way it is supposed to work. People have not obliged themselves of the need that in order to keep a republic, you have to do the research on the candidates that have applied for your job. You have a requirement, a need, for you to actually come out and vote. Look, I get it. There are so many I have heard from that are disenfranchised voters. They say: We hear about all these people. John Fund has a great book out on the fraud that has been in so many of our modern elections that is not being dealt with, despite what the government says. It is a great book. People find out there is fraud. Since they didn't have to have a photo ID like you have to have to buy cigarettes or alcohol or get on a plane or anything else, you can manipulate the system, you can vote more than one time. My friend from south Texas told me about some of the people who were illegally in the country being approached with voter registration forms, saying: Fill these out. If you don't want to use your own address here, just use one central address. You can all use the same address. Some of them were worried about showing an ID. They will figure out we are illegally in this country and we are not supposed to vote. They were assured: No, no. President Obama's lawyer--Eric Holder at that time--has gotten a judge to rule that they can't require an ID and, therefore, all you have to do is fill this out. But if you don't fill this out, then Republicans are going to take away your welfare, they are going to take away your health care, and they are going to try to make you leave the country. So you have got to fill this out. And even though it is illegal, there is nothing wrong with doing it. You will get the voter registration card in the mail to the address you give them, and then you just go vote and that is all you have to show them. Thankfully, we have voter ID now in Texas. But there are so many people who have been disenfranchised, because they say: There is so much voter fraud going on. Why should I even bother? My vote doesn't count like somebody that votes more than once. We are in grave danger of losing this republic. We are not going to keep it much longer the way we are going. We haven't educated future generations to how you go about keeping a self-governing republic. Some have been miseducated to think socialism, which has failed every single time it has ever been tried--it will always fail. We haven't educated them about the truth of freedom and what is required to keep it. Justice Scalia told a group from my hometown that was here that the reason we are the most free Nation in history is not because we had the best Bill of Rights, but because the Founders didn't trust government. They wanted gridlock. They wanted it as difficult as possible to pass laws, because with the passage of every law is the risk that some freedom will be taken away by the Big Government. {time} 1245 The Founders knew that, and they made it hard to pass laws. That is not a bad thing. It is a good thing. But when he mentioned that the Soviet Union had a better bill of rights than we had, I remembered, I did a paper back in college when I was at Texas A&M. After I had visited the Soviet Union as an exchange student, I wrote a paper on their system. But I had done a paper on their bill of rights, their Constitution. I was shocked at the extent of the rights that were guaranteed to the Soviet Union citizens. I was also surprised to find that, in the early sixties, the Premier, Khrushchev, in the Soviet Union, had set up a commission, because those that had truly been educated on the different forms of government and governing know that, actually, true communism is only when there is no government, that it is like reaching for nirvana. You eventually reach the point where everybody is so sharing and so giving--taking from their ability, giving to the need--they are so giving that you don't even need a government anymore. So Khrushchev set up a commission basically charged with coming up with a plan to reach that ultimate goal where someday there will be no government and we will have true communism in its purest form, no government, everyone giving, sharing, lovingly. And I read that, after a couple of years of that commission trying to figure out, ``How are we ever going to come up with a plan that eventuates in having no government and everybody always sharing equally? How are we going to ever pull that off?'' they couldn't come up with a way to reach that in this world, in this life, and so Khrushchev disbanded the commission. There was no way to get there. They were right. If you are going to have communism or socialism, you are going to have to have a totalitarian government, whether it is an individual dictator or a political group like they have or used to have at the Kremlin. You have got to have ruling autocrats, an oligarch, monarch, in order to force everybody to take from those who have worked hard, according to their ability, and giving to those who either can't work or choose not to work. The only way you can maximize freedoms is when people in the country understand what Franklin understood: you have got a republic if you can keep it. We are not being vigilant to keep our Republic, and that is why so many are desperate now as they vote for a Presidential candidate. And even Christian friends have said, you know, I understand there is a time and place for a David with a slingshot, complete faith in God, and a clear great ability with a slingshot. I know there is a time for that. But right now, our freedoms have been so badly eroded, we are losing the government. We are having people come in and start voting without understanding how you preserve a republic. We are losing the country. We are losing the melting pot that we once were, welcoming people [[Page H1579]] from all over and coming together and being molded into one thing, not a hyphenated American, but an American. We are losing that. You see many voters standing in lines now. They didn't used to ever do this, stand in line for hours. You found people do that in Africa when they are finally afforded an opportunity to vote for the first time in their lives. But now, in America, some people are waiting hours to vote because they see that we have not been vigilant in protecting our Republic, and just as Franklin worried, we are about to lose it. We are already losing it when the government can dictate that individuals buy a product, when the government can say you can only practice your religious beliefs if you are within the confines of a church, but if you are an individual, like the Founders were, who held tightly to their religious beliefs--they talked about it as they passed legislation; they talked about it as they created our Constitution--the Supreme Court is now saying: Secular humanism is what we must have; it is what we demand. And since we are in charge and we are moving toward being socialistic, you have got to have an oligarchy, and we are it. Obviously, they don't say it in those words, but that is what their actions say, and that is why, when a Justice says: Well, this Court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that we were moving the line from beyond a church and extending that line out to other religious institutions--like the Little Sisters of the Poor, these wonderful, superb Christian women who have given their lives doing what Jesus said, ministering to others, feeding His sheep, ministering to their physical needs, their healthcare needs--and the Supreme Court says: We have a lot of trouble. See, they are not actually a church. They are a religious institution, and we are going to have a hard time writing an opinion that moves the line to protect religious opinions. My word, shouldn't have any trouble drawing a line at individuals. Any individual in the United States of America who has a deeply held, sincerely held religious belief, it was meant to be protected, unless it is completely anathema to our Constitution. Sharia law is anathema; and to the extent that some believe they should replace our Constitution with their sharia law, then that is treason if they are here in this country. But otherwise, their religious belief should be recognized, and God help us if the Court doesn't do it right. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1574-H1579] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WHEN THE LAW DOES NOT FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa). The Life and Legacy of Isaac Lowe Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for yielding to me so I may pay tribute to a great, stellar woman from northern California. This can't be done in a 1-minute speech, so a little extra time is very, very fitting in recognition of her work and her life. In rising today, I join with many northstate residents in honoring the life and legacy of Isaac Lowe, an incredible woman and a prominent civil rights leader, who passed away just a few weeks ago in Redding, California. She was born in 1921 in Wharton, Texas. Isaac was the second youngest of nine children, learning early the importance of hard work. She attended Tillotson Business College in Austin, Texas, and Prairie View A&M in Prairie View. It was during a visit to check up on a sick friend in California when she met her future husband, Vernon Lowe, whom she married soon after and started her family in Redding, California. Being an African American woman in the 1940s, unfortunately, racism was no stranger to Isaac. Despite holding a business degree, she was denied jobs because employers chose to judge her skin color rather than her impressive credentials. Isaac did not give up. She started a catering business in Redding, and she eventually became the first Black woman to be hired by the County of Shasta, working in social services for 17 years and helping others. However, Isaac's most noble work was through her plight to advance racial equality in her own neighborhood. Upon first moving to Redding, all but one of the Black families lived on the same street and were segregated from the community. This was a status quo that she didn't accept. Isaac joined her husband in founding the Redding chapter of the NAACP and began her 65-year journey of advocating for civil rights and worked very hard in order to hold onto that charter of the NAACP when times got a little leaner back in the seventies. She lobbied city and county lawmakers for safe and affordable housing for Black families. She worked with local school officials for the equal treatment of Black children in the community's mainly White schools. She fought for fairness and justice under the law for all citizens in the judicial system. She raised funds and successfully sought approval from city hall for the construction of the only Martin Luther King, Jr., community center between Sacramento and Oregon at that time. It was her compassionate advocacy and her resiliency that helped change Shasta County for the better. Some of her most notable accomplishments included being the first Black woman to serve on Shasta County's grand jury, where she served as a founding member of the Shasta County Citizens Against Racism and was awarded the Redding Citizen of the Year in 1992. Her proudest moment was in getting the Redding City Council members to recognize Martin Luther King Day as a holiday. Her legacy speaks volumes of the person she was and of the impact she had on so many lives. One of the anecdotes I know about her informally is that she was fairly commonly referred to as the ``Rosa Parks of Redding, California.'' She was a deeply caring friend, a loving wife and mother, and a selfless advocate. I had the chance to meet Isaac personally on different occasions-- some positive and one, actually, a very negative occasion, but it was made positive by how the community responded to a very ugly racial incident that took place against a Black family in their home. Many of us in the community joined together in a march in solidarity, protesting, that we were not going to tolerate this in our community in northern California. Isaac was there, being strong but also being that smiling, positive voice. You could see her strength. You could also see the light shining from within her as she advocated for what was right for everybody, really, at the end of the day. If we had more people like her and if we had more harmony instead of the divisiveness that we see so badly affecting this country today, we would be much better off. Northern California has lost a gem, but her legacy will live on, and we all recognize that. I am honored to be able to note that here today on the U.S. House floor and to properly show that. Her legacy even lives on in the papers she published and that are right over here in the Library of Congress, which note some of her work in the past for the NAACP. Indeed, it is a rich legacy that reaches all the way to Washington, D.C. I appreciate my colleague from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for allowing me to make this special tribute to Isaac Lowe today. Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from California (Mr. LaMalfa). I did not realize I should have been joining in that tribute with the gentleman. Her being born in Wharton, Texas, and going to college in Texas, we share her as a real gem that the Lord provided to both of us. I thank the gentleman for sharing that with us. Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of being allowed to attend oral arguments at the Supreme Court, and I appreciate their staff and their accomodation. Not everybody over there recognizes that there are three independent, coequal branches of government the way the Founders intended, but I am extremely grateful for those who do, and we afford the mutual respect between us. That is a good thing. So, to the clerk of the Court and to Perry and others, I thank you for your accomodation. I am a member of the Supreme Court Bar, which allows attorneys, as far as seating, to come sit in front of the bar, on the side of the bar with the litigants, and to get a real ringside seat--actually, inside the ring. The case today was, actually, a consolidation of a number of cases. Probably most well-known--probably that should be most well-known--was the Little Sisters of the Poor. We had representatives from East Texas Baptist University in my district in Marshall, Texas. It is just a super school. They are a religious school, and they are not ashamed, because they are East Texas Baptist University, to teach what religious convictions inform them are the right things to do. They follow the law. The problem is when the law does not follow the Constitution, and that is what has gotten us into the problem that was faced today and is being faced at the Supreme Court. It is amazing. I was telling a group here just recently that, in east Texas, we call it ``common sense,'' but when I get to Washington, we usually just [[Page H1575]] have to call it ``sense'' because it is not common at all. I found that to be the case at the Supreme Court during oral arguments. I do have great sympathy for all of the eight remaining Justices in this regard. {time} 1200 Once the Supreme Court issues a ruling that clearly violates the Constitution, for all who truly have eyes and truly have ears to hear not clouded by secular humanism, but informed by the Constitution's words itself, then they see that, when a court rules against the Constitution, violating the Constitution by its very ruling, it creates a terribly difficult situation for itself. Because once the bold, visible lines that are spelled out in the Constitution are violated and erased, the Court is charged with an ongoing impossible task of trying to find a place to redraw those lines. Now, it is unfortunate that some of the Justices--in fact, four of them--kept trying to draw a line in a manner that was not before the Court. They showed themselves to be not necessarily very able jurists who loved justice, but, in fact, very experienced politicians. Because politicians know, if you are wrong on an issue and somebody brings up the issue about which you are wrong, the thing to do is change the subject and make it about something that you are not wrong about. You point to something that is a very difficult question and say that that is a very difficult question and, as good magicians do, divert the attention away from the wrong that you have already done and that you are about to complicate. Mr. Speaker, the wrong about which I speak was the violation by Congress coupled with the violation by the Supreme Court itself. For the first time in our Nation's history, having the United States Federal Government with all its powers, its guns, its ability to take people's homes--well, that is the IRS. Most folks can't take homes. But to just wreak havoc on the well-being of a family, of a business, the Federal Government says for the first time: You have to purchase a product. It is required. There is nothing in the Constitution that either allows or encourages the United States Government to order all American citizens to buy a product. As we went through discussion on ObamaCare back during 2009 until it passed in 2010, at first, the President and his minions were saying that, well, clearly this is not a tax. It was a mandate. It says: You must buy a product and, if you don't comply with our Federal order to buy this product, this health insurance--and it has to be what we say health insurance is, not some idea you have--we will dictate what the health insurance is, and you have to provide it. If you don't, it is not a tax. There is a penalty for violating the law, the mandatory obligation that we have imposed on every American. Well, nothing allows that and many things prohibit it. Over the years, Members of Congress and even the Supreme Court and Presidents have used the Commerce Clause, that we have the right to control interstate commerce, as the basis for which to get involved in matters of commerce that lie within a State. In this case, Chief Justice Roberts in this part of the opinion very correctly states that, if you allow the Federal Government to say we have jurisdiction to mandate people buy health insurance and not just any health insurance. It has to have the things in it that we dictate, then there is no place you could ever draw a line and say the Commerce Clause does not allow for this and ultimately decided that, under the Commerce Clause, ObamaCare was unconstitutional. Simply citing the fact that everybody, at some point, seeks health care--and most people have some form of health insurance at some point--that does not give the Federal Government the right to come in and take over and even dictate the purchase of a product. We had some in this room and at the other end of this building in the Senate who furthered the argument that this is old news, that the Government has been able to do this for many years. It is called car insurance or automobile insurance. Governments have been requiring insurance and penalizing if you didn't buy insurance for years. This is not a new concept. The trouble is that was not an appropriate comparison at all. For one thing, that is activity within the State. It was not the Federal Government that required an insurance policy. And there was no mandate that everyone within a State had to have that car insurance. Courts have long held that driving on a highway built by the State or Federal Government or county is a privilege. You do not have a constitutional right to drive a car on a government road. But if you choose to drive a car, a vehicle, on a government road, in that case, then you must have insurance. The difference is driving on a road is a privilege. In the case of ObamaCare, the Federal Government said just breathing, walking around living or even lying prostrate in your bed, even if you are confined to your bed--it doesn't matter--just being a living person we will say under our Constitution is a privilege that the government giveth and the government taketh away. Therefore, we are saying that, if you are going to exist, breathe, live, you must have health insurance, and not just any health insurance. It has to have the provisions we say and those will not necessarily include the things you need in your life. We, as the omniscient, ubiquitous government--of course, it may be more ubiquitous than we know--we have a right to tell you what is good for you and what isn't. Once the government can tell you what you have to have or have not in the way of health care, they have the right to control your life. So it was interesting, for one thing, that, in this case, the government had conceded that these were sincerely, deeply held religious beliefs of all the plaintiffs. So that was not an issue. It was not an issue like some people who were trying to dodge the draft, except for religious purposes when sometimes it was and sometimes it was not. It was conceded in this case all of the deeply held religious beliefs were very sincere by the litigants. I heard something I don't know that I have heard before in a Supreme Court argument when Justice Sotomayor made a statement of fact about the case. One of the litigants who may not have been politically astute, but, apparently, accurate, said that, factually, Justice Sotomayor, that is just not the case. That is just not true here. Where four of the Justices showed incredible aptitude for being politicians and not Justices, they diverted attention--as I said, good magicians do this. Good politicians do this. They diverted attention away from the real problem and diverted away from the actual question before the Court and kept digging and pointing to a question that was not before the Court. That point was that the four Justices kept wanting to talk about objections to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. They kept wanting to talk about the difficulty in drawing lines, that: ``Gee, what do we do if the plaintiffs or the defendants''--the litigants in the particular case--subjects would probably be more accurate under ObamaCare--the subjects of the United States--it used to be U.S. citizens--``are not objecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs?'' That has come up in cases before where someone would say: ``I believe my religious belief is so personal. You should not make me object on the basis of religious beliefs because then I would have to reveal what my religious beliefs are and that is none of your business. So we object to objecting.'' So the four most liberal Justices kept wanting to talk about: ``But where do we draw the line in this issue if there is an objection to objecting on the basis of religious grounds?'' The able attorneys for the American subjects to the fast-growing monarchy here in the United States kept trying to bring them back to what was before the Court: ``Justices, none of these clients, none of the litigants, object to objecting on religious grounds. They have no problem with objecting on religious grounds. They have objected on [[Page H1576]] religious grounds. They filed objections both administratively and in court when they filed for injunction. They have had no problem objecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. So that is not really an issue.'' Once again, when Justices are in the wrong, they don't want to talk about the issue before the Court. They want to talk about the issue that is not before the Court. Let's talk about how many angels you might could get on the head of a needle. Let's talk about anything but the elephant in the room. The real elephant in the room and the reason for which I have sympathy for all eight Justices is that, once they violated the Constitution by saying ObamaCare was constitutional, they created so many scenarios that are going to be nightmares for the Court to try to figure out where we stop the flood as it overwhelms the rights of Americans. It is just a massive--like that 1950s movie or maybe it was early '60s--``The Blob.'' You just couldn't stop it. It would go out one place and come out another. And that is the problem when the Supreme Court violates the Constitution in the case of ObamaCare, saying: You can dictate to American citizens. You can make them American subjects to this all- powerful, dictatorial Federal Government. You can tell them what to buy. You can punish them for not buying it. And, of course, we know that--although Chief Justice Roberts was exactly right and on point when he said: Gee, if you try to use the Commerce Clause, jurisdiction over interstate commerce, to justify the takeover of health care and a mandate to buy something the Federal Government says you have to buy, then there is no limit ever that can be drawn on the Commerce Clause. {time} 1215 So it is not constitutional under the Commerce Clause. It certainly appeared accurate when Chief Justice Roberts went through an explanation of the initial issue that they had to take up on ObamaCare, and that was the anti-injunction statute, which basically requires that, before a litigant in Federal court can have standing to be before the court and if it involves a tax, then the litigant must be someone against whom the tax has already been levied and the tax has already been paid. Only if the tax has been levied against the litigant and the tax has been paid do the courts recognize standing by that litigant to be before the court to make argument over any complaint. So they had to deal with that issue because not only does a litigant not have standing to even stay in court if they are arguing about a tax and the tax has not been levied and the tax has not been paid, but the Federal court itself has no jurisdiction to even hear the controversy until the tax is levied and the tax is paid. So Chief Justice Roberts had the difficult problem of investigating and ruling on whether or not the mandate and the penalty that comes if you don't purchase what is required by the Federal Government--is that a penalty or is that a tax? Because if it is a tax, the law is very clear. We will have to rule that the plaintiffs do not have standing and their case be thrown out. And, similarly, we will rule that the Court does not have jurisdiction. The case, as it is said in court, is not ripe for litigation. So it will have to be thrown out. If the court found that the penalty imposed by the Federal Government for not being a loyal American subject and buying a product that the monarchy or the growing dictatorship here says you have to buy--if it is a penalty, then you can come to court. We do have jurisdiction, and you do have standing. So Chief Justice Roberts went through and ably explained how Congress called it a penalty. At that time, of course, the Democrats were in the majority here in the House as well as the Senate. The Democratic leadership, the Democratic supporters in favor of ObamaCare, had made it clear this is a penalty. Chief Justice Roberts cited that, that Congress should know better than anyone else whether this is a penalty or it is a tax. Because if it is a penalty, again, the litigant can be here and have standing. We have got jurisdiction. But if it is a tax, we have to throw it out. We can't hear the case, not now. He said Congress should know better than anyone. They decided it was a penalty. Not only that, but it really does appear to be a penalty because ObamaCare says: You have to buy insurance and you have to buy a product we say is okay. You can't buy what you want. You have to buy what we say you must buy. And if you don't do that, we will impose a financial penalty on you. I am hearing more and more young people who are really perplexed: Yes. The government is giving me a subsidy to help me pay for my insurance, but my insurance has 5-, 6-, 7-, $8,000 of a threshold that I have to meet before it ever helps me with a dime of insurance help. So am I better off getting the government subsidy, paying all this money that is really making my life miserable, or should I go ahead and pay the new income tax that I have added on to me for not having insurance as is dictated? I think Chief Justice Roberts came to a proper conclusion. This truly is a penalty. It is not a tax because it is only paid if you violate the mandate that the Federal Government dictated. So, clearly, it is a penalty. So there at page 1415 of the opinion, Chief Justice Roberts concludes: Okay. Congress says it is a penalty. It obviously is a penalty. If you don't want to pay the penalty, then buy the insurance. You won't have the penalty. It is clearly a penalty. Since it is a penalty, the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply. Therefore, the plaintiffs do have standing, and not only do they have standing, but this court has jurisdiction. Now, because it is a penalty and not a tax, we have jurisdiction. So now we will proceed to consider the primary cause before us, whether or not the Federal Government can mandate for the first time in history that all of the American people buy a product that it dictates. Then he went through and determined, if you say the Commerce Clause justifies Federal jurisdiction here, then the Commerce Clause has no limits, has no meaning. And we choose to find that the Commerce Clause has meaning. Therefore, this is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. But, then again, about 40 pages after he says it is not a tax, it is a penalty, Chief Justice Roberts plays the mental gymnastics of arriving at saying: You know what. It turns out this really is not a penalty. It is a tax. And since it is a tax, a majority of us will find that it is constitutional. And so the Federal Government can impose a mandate requiring that all American citizens be loyal subjects, subject to the dictatorship here in Washington, buy whatever product we tell them to buy. And all of that is because the Supreme Court rewrote the law and called it a tax. That is why the Supreme Court is struggling the way it is today. Because when you create an abomination, you violate the Constitution to the extent, you violate your conscience the way it was before it got so clouded with politics. You violate the Constitution and then you create the kind of mess that is before the Supreme Court today. It is incredible to sit and listen to the Supreme Court struggling over this issue of just how far we can go to violate someone's religious beliefs. I didn't hear any one of the Justices refer to the First Amendment, that the government will establish no religion and not violate--or not prohibit the free exercise thereof. My friend, Keith Rothfus, a fellow Member of Congress, was sitting beside me. He got sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court bar today. Keith Rothfus was pointing out that, in one of the prior Supreme Court decisions back in the 1960s, they actually had a footnote where they listed a lot of the religions that they found currently in the United States. It was a fairly full list. But one of the religions in the United States recognized by the Supreme Court in the early 1960s was secular humanism. As Keith Rothfus and I agreed, we have now come to the point where we are violating the First Amendment of the Constitution. And not only are we violating the restraint against the Federal Government prohibiting the free exercise of religion, as it is doing for East Texas Baptist University, Houston Baptist University, Little Sisters of the Poor, [[Page H1577]] so many organizations that are religious in nature, but they have violated the part that said we will have no establishment of religion. The Founders were thinking specifically about the Church of England and how the King didn't like the way the Vatican was ruling. And so he just created his own church, the Church of England. He said: Everybody has got to participate in my church now. They didn't want that to ever happen where the government of the land could dictate the religion that people had to practice. Yet, that is what the Supreme Court has now done because it has now recognized secular humanism--not just recognized, but established secular humanism--as the State-sponsored religion in America. With the ruling last summer, the Supreme Court, in effect, said: Since the 1960s, we have been limiting people's ability to use the word God, to pray to God, to read God's word, the Bible. We have been prohibiting that for 40 or so years, 50 years maybe, and we have been protecting what Moses said was the Word of God and what Jesus said was the Word of God for far too long. They basically established secular humanism as the official religion of the United States. By their pronouncement, they were saying to forget what Moses said God said, forget what Jesus said. When Jesus actually was asked about marriage and divorce, he quoted Moses verbatim: A man shall leave his father and mother, a woman leave her home. The two will become one flesh. Then Jesus added, not just quoting Moses as to what Moses said God said about marriage: And what God has joined together, let nobody take apart. The Supreme Court last summer said: The effect of the ruling is not only can you not talk about God publicly or pray or read the Bible, thank God we have speech and debate clause privileges here on this floor where I am actually free to even mention the word God. We pray every day to start our official day here in session. But the Supreme Court ruled, in effect: We are your God. The five of us in the majority of the Supreme Court are now your God. Forget what we said in our prior decisions about marriage. It was not mentioned in the Constitution. Therefore, under the 10th Amendment, it is reserved to the States and the people. Forget the fact that we have talked before about the States will decide what marriage is. Forget our ruling on DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress, where we made very clear that the States only have the right to decide what marriage is. Forget all that. Now we five majority Justices are your God. And forget the fact that we--at least two of us have violated the Federal law in order to reach this decision. Because the Federal law is very clear. If a judge--a Federal judge, magistrate, Justice might have their impartiality--his or her impartiality questioned, then they should disqualify--they shall disqualify themselves from sitting on the case. So we had two Justices. Not only was their opinion and their impartiality in question, there was actually no question that they were not impartial because they had both participated in same-sex wedding ceremonies. And Justice Ginsburg, who is a very nice lady, actually said--as Maureen Dowd pointed out in her article, she emphasized as she pronounced them married by virtue of the laws of the--and she said she really hammered the words--by the Constitution of the United States. {time} 1230 So, clearly, we had Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg perform same- sex marriages before they were not impartial. The law required them to disqualify themselves. I have had some people say: Well, wouldn't it have disqualified any of the other judges if they had ever participated in a marriage between a man and a woman? The answer is very easily and clearly no, because that was the law. The question is: Can a government prohibit same-sex marriage? It was same-sex marriage that was before the court, not can a government prohibit marriage between a man and a woman. If the question had been: Can a government prohibit marriage between a man and a woman, then that might be a different story. But that was not the issue before the court. Two Justices were disqualified. They had made their opinion clearly known in advance. There were other judges who had been asked, as I understand it, to do weddings, but they said: No, that might create a question of my impartiality and would require me to disqualify myself. Well, their participation did certainly disqualify them. They refused to disqualify themselves. So two Justices, as a minimum, were disqualified as they participated in the majority of five. So when you have an unconstitutional ruling by the United States Supreme Court, when the Chief Justice has to commit to the mental gymnastics, the loop-the-loops that he has to try to do to get around saying the mandate to purchase a policy that carries a penalty, is a penalty, and then over here we know he said it is a penalty over there, but now we are saying it is a tax, not a penalty, they created a nightmare for any legitimate judge with a conscience in trying to decide: Now that we have blown apart any constitutional lines, where do we draw the lines now? It is rather tragic. Justice Kennedy was questioning one of the religious litigant's attorneys and made the statement, basically, that the court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that if we give an exemption to a church, we then have to give it to all other religious institutions. Well, that statement deeply troubled me as well because it means that Justice Kennedy does not understand the constitutional prohibition in the First Amendment. You are not on the Supreme Court or in Congress or in the Presidency to ever establish a religion. And it has been established. It is called secular humanism, which the Supreme Court has recognized as a religion. That is what is being established now. You are also not to prohibit the free exercise of religion. When the Supreme Court gets to the point, as Justice Kennedy is, that we on this court--at least a majority--will find it very hard to say that if you are not a part of a church and acting as that church, then you have no right to practice any of your religious beliefs that five of us don't like, that is tragic. I keep coming back to that prophetic statement by Benjamin Franklin when he was asked after the Constitutional Convention by a dear lady: What did you give us? ``A republic, madam, if you can keep it.'' Why would he say ``if you can keep it?'' The reason he said that is--as he knew--the nature of government is to take more and more power and authority over individual rights and individual liberties. And in order to keep a republic, as Ben Franklin called it, you have to teach generation after generation that there are responsibilities that come with citizenship. Because if you don't live up to those responsibilities, you will lose the republic, madam. You can't keep it. We have done a miserable job of teaching the next generation about how you would keep a republic. Instead of being taught, as I was, in school the dangers of socialism, the dangers of communism, and that it always has to result in a dictatorship or a totalitarian government, that it requires people's rights be taken away, our Founders say that we have to recognize these rights are a gift from our Creator, from God, because if we say they are a gift of the government, then what the government giveth, the government can taketh away. We have legislators and judges who have not been properly educated on the manner in which you keep a republic, madam. It really has been heartbreaking when very smart young people ask sincerely: I understand socialism is supposed to be wrong, communism is supposed to be wrong, but it really sounds nice. Can you explain why it would be wrong? Because I don't get it. It sounds nice. As the New Testament Church started out, as the Pilgrims' Compact started out, you bring into the common storehouse, and then you share and share alike. You share from those according to their ability to those according to their need. Of course, more than one parent has explained socialism to their children [[Page H1578]] by saying: Look, you got an A. I know how hard you were working every night doing your homework, but your friend over here got a C. I saw her out partying a lot of times when you were here studying. And she is not maybe quite as smart as you are, so she got a C, you got an A. The socialist notion is that we have to give everybody a B. So we will make this A a B, we will make this C a B, and everybody will feel better for it. Mr. Speaker, I have shared this before, but it was such a lesson to me as an exchange student to the Soviet Union being out at a collective farm. The farmers were sitting in the shade in midmorning, when anybody back home in east Texas knows that--especially in July, like it was-- you start early and you try to finish early before the sun gets too hot. It is midmorning. This is prime time to be working before it gets too hot. And here are all the farmers sitting in the shade in the middle of their village. Trying to use the best Russian I could--I had 2 years, which meant I could converse ably with a 4-year-old--I asked: When do you work out in the field? I couldn't tell what they cultivated and didn't. It all looked brown. None of it looked very good. I would have expected in Texas that those fields would have been green, looking good, and the weeds out. You couldn't tell what was weeds and what wasn't. I said: When do you work out in the field? They laughed, and I thought I must not have translated that right. Then one of them said in Russian, basically: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the field in the sun or if I am here in the shade. So I am here in the shade. I have carried that with me all these years. That is why socialism can't work. It is why socialism or communism--again, bringing all into the common storehouse, share and sharing alike--can never work on this Earth, in this world. Because the only way you will ever have share and share alike, as they found out in the New Testament Church, the only way you can make it work is if you have a totalitarian government that says: you will do what we say. And then there goes your freedoms. So the only way to have the maximum amount of freedom is to have a self-governing republic so people can govern themselves by electing people that they have interviewed, they have read all about, done plenty of research on, and then they come forward on hiring day-- otherwise known as election day--and they vote to hire the person that they want for their public servant. That is the way it is supposed to work. People have not obliged themselves of the need that in order to keep a republic, you have to do the research on the candidates that have applied for your job. You have a requirement, a need, for you to actually come out and vote. Look, I get it. There are so many I have heard from that are disenfranchised voters. They say: We hear about all these people. John Fund has a great book out on the fraud that has been in so many of our modern elections that is not being dealt with, despite what the government says. It is a great book. People find out there is fraud. Since they didn't have to have a photo ID like you have to have to buy cigarettes or alcohol or get on a plane or anything else, you can manipulate the system, you can vote more than one time. My friend from south Texas told me about some of the people who were illegally in the country being approached with voter registration forms, saying: Fill these out. If you don't want to use your own address here, just use one central address. You can all use the same address. Some of them were worried about showing an ID. They will figure out we are illegally in this country and we are not supposed to vote. They were assured: No, no. President Obama's lawyer--Eric Holder at that time--has gotten a judge to rule that they can't require an ID and, therefore, all you have to do is fill this out. But if you don't fill this out, then Republicans are going to take away your welfare, they are going to take away your health care, and they are going to try to make you leave the country. So you have got to fill this out. And even though it is illegal, there is nothing wrong with doing it. You will get the voter registration card in the mail to the address you give them, and then you just go vote and that is all you have to show them. Thankfully, we have voter ID now in Texas. But there are so many people who have been disenfranchised, because they say: There is so much voter fraud going on. Why should I even bother? My vote doesn't count like somebody that votes more than once. We are in grave danger of losing this republic. We are not going to keep it much longer the way we are going. We haven't educated future generations to how you go about keeping a self-governing republic. Some have been miseducated to think socialism, which has failed every single time it has ever been tried--it will always fail. We haven't educated them about the truth of freedom and what is required to keep it. Justice Scalia told a group from my hometown that was here that the reason we are the most free Nation in history is not because we had the best Bill of Rights, but because the Founders didn't trust government. They wanted gridlock. They wanted it as difficult as possible to pass laws, because with the passage of every law is the risk that some freedom will be taken away by the Big Government. {time} 1245 The Founders knew that, and they made it hard to pass laws. That is not a bad thing. It is a good thing. But when he mentioned that the Soviet Union had a better bill of rights than we had, I remembered, I did a paper back in college when I was at Texas A&M. After I had visited the Soviet Union as an exchange student, I wrote a paper on their system. But I had done a paper on their bill of rights, their Constitution. I was shocked at the extent of the rights that were guaranteed to the Soviet Union citizens. I was also surprised to find that, in the early sixties, the Premier, Khrushchev, in the Soviet Union, had set up a commission, because those that had truly been educated on the different forms of government and governing know that, actually, true communism is only when there is no government, that it is like reaching for nirvana. You eventually reach the point where everybody is so sharing and so giving--taking from their ability, giving to the need--they are so giving that you don't even need a government anymore. So Khrushchev set up a commission basically charged with coming up with a plan to reach that ultimate goal where someday there will be no government and we will have true communism in its purest form, no government, everyone giving, sharing, lovingly. And I read that, after a couple of years of that commission trying to figure out, ``How are we ever going to come up with a plan that eventuates in having no government and everybody always sharing equally? How are we going to ever pull that off?'' they couldn't come up with a way to reach that in this world, in this life, and so Khrushchev disbanded the commission. There was no way to get there. They were right. If you are going to have communism or socialism, you are going to have to have a totalitarian government, whether it is an individual dictator or a political group like they have or used to have at the Kremlin. You have got to have ruling autocrats, an oligarch, monarch, in order to force everybody to take from those who have worked hard, according to their ability, and giving to those who either can't work or choose not to work. The only way you can maximize freedoms is when people in the country understand what Franklin understood: you have got a republic if you can keep it. We are not being vigilant to keep our Republic, and that is why so many are desperate now as they vote for a Presidential candidate. And even Christian friends have said, you know, I understand there is a time and place for a David with a slingshot, complete faith in God, and a clear great ability with a slingshot. I know there is a time for that. But right now, our freedoms have been so badly eroded, we are losing the government. We are having people come in and start voting without understanding how you preserve a republic. We are losing the country. We are losing the melting pot that we once were, welcoming people [[Page H1579]] from all over and coming together and being molded into one thing, not a hyphenated American, but an American. We are losing that. You see many voters standing in lines now. They didn't used to ever do this, stand in line for hours. You found people do that in Africa when they are finally afforded an opportunity to vote for the first time in their lives. But now, in America, some people are waiting hours to vote because they see that we have not been vigilant in protecting our Republic, and just as Franklin worried, we are about to lose it. We are already losing it when the government can dictate that individuals buy a product, when the government can say you can only practice your religious beliefs if you are within the confines of a church, but if you are an individual, like the Founders were, who held tightly to their religious beliefs--they talked about it as they passed legislation; they talked about it as they created our Constitution--the Supreme Court is now saying: Secular humanism is what we must have; it is what we demand. And since we are in charge and we are moving toward being socialistic, you have got to have an oligarchy, and we are it. Obviously, they don't say it in those words, but that is what their actions say, and that is why, when a Justice says: Well, this Court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that we were moving the line from beyond a church and extending that line out to other religious institutions--like the Little Sisters of the Poor, these wonderful, superb Christian women who have given their lives doing what Jesus said, ministering to others, feeding His sheep, ministering to their physical needs, their healthcare needs--and the Supreme Court says: We have a lot of trouble. See, they are not actually a church. They are a religious institution, and we are going to have a hard time writing an opinion that moves the line to protect religious opinions. My word, shouldn't have any trouble drawing a line at individuals. Any individual in the United States of America who has a deeply held, sincerely held religious belief, it was meant to be protected, unless it is completely anathema to our Constitution. Sharia law is anathema; and to the extent that some believe they should replace our Constitution with their sharia law, then that is treason if they are here in this country. But otherwise, their religious belief should be recognized, and God help us if the Court doesn't do it right. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_292.csv,42559,42559,42629,"[congressional record volume 162, number 46 (wednesday, march 23, 2016)] [house] [pages h1574-h1579] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] when the law does not follow the constitution the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from california (mr. lamalfa). the life and legacy of isaac lowe mr. lamalfa. mr. speaker, i appreciate my colleague from texas (mr. gohmert) for yielding to me so i may pay tribute to a great, stellar woman from northern california. this can't be done in a 1-minute speech, so a little extra time is very, very fitting in recognition of her work and her life. in rising today, i join with many northstate residents in honoring the life and legacy of isaac lowe, an incredible woman and a prominent civil rights leader, who passed away just a few weeks ago in redding, california. she was born in 1921 in wharton, texas. isaac was the second youngest of nine children, learning early the importance of hard work. she attended tillotson business college in austin, texas, and prairie view a&m in prairie view. it was during a visit to check up on a sick friend in california when she met her future husband, vernon lowe, whom she married soon after and started her family in redding, california. being an african american woman in the 1940s, unfortunately, racism was no stranger to isaac. despite holding a business degree, she was denied jobs because employers chose to judge her skin color rather than her impressive credentials. isaac did not give up. she started a catering business in redding, and she eventually became the first black woman to be hired by the county of shasta, working in social services for 17 years and helping others. however, isaac's most noble work was through her plight to advance racial equality in her own neighborhood. upon first moving to redding, all but one of the black families lived on the same street and were segregated from the community. this was a status quo that she didn't accept. isaac joined her husband in founding the redding chapter of the naacp and began her 65-year journey of advocating for civil rights and worked very hard in order to hold onto that charter of the naacp when times got a little leaner back in the seventies. she lobbied city and county lawmakers for safe and affordable housing for black families. she worked with local school officials for the equal treatment of black children in the community's mainly white schools. she fought for fairness and justice under the law for all citizens in the judicial system. she raised funds and successfully sought approval from city hall for the construction of the only martin luther king, jr., community center between sacramento and oregon at that time. it was her compassionate advocacy and her resiliency that helped change shasta county for the better. some of her most notable accomplishments included being the first black woman to serve on shasta county's grand jury, where she served as a founding member of the shasta county citizens against racism and was awarded the redding citizen of the year in 1992. her proudest moment was in getting the redding city council members to recognize martin luther king day as a holiday. her legacy speaks volumes of the person she was and of the impact she had on so many lives. one of the anecdotes i know about her informally is that she was fairly commonly referred to as the ``rosa parks of redding, california.'' she was a deeply caring friend, a loving wife and mother, and a selfless advocate. i had the chance to meet isaac personally on different occasions-- some positive and one, actually, a very negative occasion, but it was made positive by how the community responded to a very ugly racial incident that took place against a black family in their home. many of us in the community joined together in a march in solidarity, protesting, that we were not going to tolerate this in our community in northern california. isaac was there, being strong but also being that smiling, positive voice. you could see her strength. you could also see the light shining from within her as she advocated for what was right for everybody, really, at the end of the day. if we had more people like her and if we had more harmony instead of the divisiveness that we see so badly affecting this country today, we would be much better off. northern california has lost a gem, but her legacy will live on, and we all recognize that. i am honored to be able to note that here today on the u.s. house floor and to properly show that. her legacy even lives on in the papers she published and that are right over here in the library of congress, which note some of her work in the past for the naacp. indeed, it is a rich legacy that reaches all the way to washington, d.c. i appreciate my colleague from texas (mr. gohmert) for allowing me to make this special tribute to isaac lowe today. mr. gohmert. i thank my friend from california (mr. lamalfa). i did not realize i should have been joining in that tribute with the gentleman. her being born in wharton, texas, and going to college in texas, we share her as a real gem that the lord provided to both of us. i thank the gentleman for sharing that with us. mr. speaker, i had the honor of being allowed to attend oral arguments at the supreme court, and i appreciate their staff and their accomodation. not everybody over there recognizes that there are three independent, coequal branches of government the way the founders intended, but i am extremely grateful for those who do, and we afford the mutual respect between us. that is a good thing. so, to the clerk of the court and to perry and others, i thank you for your accomodation. i am a member of the supreme court bar, which allows attorneys, as far as seating, to come sit in front of the bar, on the side of the bar with the litigants, and to get a real ringside seat--actually, inside the ring. the case today was, actually, a consolidation of a number of cases. probably most well-known--probably that should be most well-known--was the little sisters of the poor. we had representatives from east texas baptist university in my district in marshall, texas. it is just a super school. they are a religious school, and they are not ashamed, because they are east texas baptist university, to teach what religious convictions inform them are the right things to do. they follow the law. the problem is when the law does not follow the constitution, and that is what has gotten us into the problem that was faced today and is being faced at the supreme court. it is amazing. i was telling a group here just recently that, in east texas, we call it ``common sense,'' but when i get to washington, we usually just [[page h1575]] have to call it ``sense'' because it is not common at all. i found that to be the case at the supreme court during oral arguments. i do have great sympathy for all of the eight remaining justices in this regard. {time} 1200 once the supreme court issues a ruling that clearly violates the constitution, for all who truly have eyes and truly have ears to hear not clouded by secular humanism, but informed by the constitution's words itself, then they see that, when a court rules against the constitution, violating the constitution by its very ruling, it creates a terribly difficult situation for itself. because once the bold, visible lines that are spelled out in the constitution are violated and erased, the court is charged with an ongoing impossible task of trying to find a place to redraw those lines. now, it is unfortunate that some of the justices--in fact, four of them--kept trying to draw a line in a manner that was not before the court. they showed themselves to be not necessarily very able jurists who loved justice, but, in fact, very experienced politicians. because politicians know, if you are wrong on an issue and somebody brings up the issue about which you are wrong, the thing to do is change the subject and make it about something that you are not wrong about. you point to something that is a very difficult question and say that that is a very difficult question and, as good magicians do, divert the attention away from the wrong that you have already done and that you are about to complicate. mr. speaker, the wrong about which i speak was the violation by congress coupled with the violation by the supreme court itself. for the first time in our nation's history, having the united states federal government with all its powers, its guns, its ability to take people's homes--well, that is the irs. most folks can't take homes. but to just wreak havoc on the well-being of a family, of a business, the federal government says for the first time: you have to purchase a product. it is required. there is nothing in the constitution that either allows or encourages the united states government to order all american citizens to buy a product. as we went through discussion on obamacare back during 2009 until it passed in 2010, at first, the president and his minions were saying that, well, clearly this is not a tax. it was a mandate. it says: you must buy a product and, if you don't comply with our federal order to buy this product, this health insurance--and it has to be what we say health insurance is, not some idea you have--we will dictate what the health insurance is, and you have to provide it. if you don't, it is not a tax. there is a penalty for violating the law, the mandatory obligation that we have imposed on every american. well, nothing allows that and many things prohibit it. over the years, members of congress and even the supreme court and presidents have used the commerce clause, that we have the right to control interstate commerce, as the basis for which to get involved in matters of commerce that lie within a state. in this case, chief justice roberts in this part of the opinion very correctly states that, if you allow the federal government to say we have jurisdiction to mandate people buy health insurance and not just any health insurance. it has to have the things in it that we dictate, then there is no place you could ever draw a line and say the commerce clause does not allow for this and ultimately decided that, under the commerce clause, obamacare was unconstitutional. simply citing the fact that everybody, at some point, seeks health care--and most people have some form of health insurance at some point--that does not give the federal government the right to come in and take over and even dictate the purchase of a product. we had some in this room and at the other end of this building in the senate who furthered the argument that this is old news, that the government has been able to do this for many years. it is called car insurance or automobile insurance. governments have been requiring insurance and penalizing if you didn't buy insurance for years. this is not a new concept. the trouble is that was not an appropriate comparison at all. for one thing, that is activity within the state. it was not the federal government that required an insurance policy. and there was no mandate that everyone within a state had to have that car insurance. courts have long held that driving on a highway built by the state or federal government or county is a privilege. you do not have a constitutional right to drive a car on a government road. but if you choose to drive a car, a vehicle, on a government road, in that case, then you must have insurance. the difference is driving on a road is a privilege. in the case of obamacare, the federal government said just breathing, walking around living or even lying prostrate in your bed, even if you are confined to your bed--it doesn't matter--just being a living person we will say under our constitution is a privilege that the government giveth and the government taketh away. therefore, we are saying that, if you are going to exist, breathe, live, you must have health insurance, and not just any health insurance. it has to have the provisions we say and those will not necessarily include the things you need in your life. we, as the omniscient, ubiquitous government--of course, it may be more ubiquitous than we know--we have a right to tell you what is good for you and what isn't. once the government can tell you what you have to have or have not in the way of health care, they have the right to control your life. so it was interesting, for one thing, that, in this case, the government had conceded that these were sincerely, deeply held religious beliefs of all the plaintiffs. so that was not an issue. it was not an issue like some people who were trying to dodge the draft, except for religious purposes when sometimes it was and sometimes it was not. it was conceded in this case all of the deeply held religious beliefs were very sincere by the litigants. i heard something i don't know that i have heard before in a supreme court argument when justice sotomayor made a statement of fact about the case. one of the litigants who may not have been politically astute, but, apparently, accurate, said that, factually, justice sotomayor, that is just not the case. that is just not true here. where four of the justices showed incredible aptitude for being politicians and not justices, they diverted attention--as i said, good magicians do this. good politicians do this. they diverted attention away from the real problem and diverted away from the actual question before the court and kept digging and pointing to a question that was not before the court. that point was that the four justices kept wanting to talk about objections to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. they kept wanting to talk about the difficulty in drawing lines, that: ``gee, what do we do if the plaintiffs or the defendants''--the litigants in the particular case--subjects would probably be more accurate under obamacare--the subjects of the united states--it used to be u.s. citizens--``are not objecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs?'' that has come up in cases before where someone would say: ``i believe my religious belief is so personal. you should not make me object on the basis of religious beliefs because then i would have to reveal what my religious beliefs are and that is none of your business. so we object to objecting.'' so the four most liberal justices kept wanting to talk about: ``but where do we draw the line in this issue if there is an objection to objecting on the basis of religious grounds?'' the able attorneys for the american subjects to the fast-growing monarchy here in the united states kept trying to bring them back to what was before the court: ``justices, none of these clients, none of the litigants, object to objecting on religious grounds. they have no problem with objecting on religious grounds. they have objected on [[page h1576]] religious grounds. they filed objections both administratively and in court when they filed for injunction. they have had no problem objecting to objecting on the basis of religious beliefs. so that is not really an issue.'' once again, when justices are in the wrong, they don't want to talk about the issue before the court. they want to talk about the issue that is not before the court. let's talk about how many angels you might could get on the head of a needle. let's talk about anything but the elephant in the room. the real elephant in the room and the reason for which i have sympathy for all eight justices is that, once they violated the constitution by saying obamacare was constitutional, they created so many scenarios that are going to be nightmares for the court to try to figure out where we stop the flood as it overwhelms the rights of americans. it is just a massive--like that 1950s movie or maybe it was early '60s--``the blob.'' you just couldn't stop it. it would go out one place and come out another. and that is the problem when the supreme court violates the constitution in the case of obamacare, saying: you can dictate to american citizens. you can make them american subjects to this all- powerful, dictatorial federal government. you can tell them what to buy. you can punish them for not buying it. and, of course, we know that--although chief justice roberts was exactly right and on point when he said: gee, if you try to use the commerce clause, jurisdiction over interstate commerce, to justify the takeover of health care and a mandate to buy something the federal government says you have to buy, then there is no limit ever that can be drawn on the commerce clause. {time} 1215 so it is not constitutional under the commerce clause. it certainly appeared accurate when chief justice roberts went through an explanation of the initial issue that they had to take up on obamacare, and that was the anti-injunction statute, which basically requires that, before a litigant in federal court can have standing to be before the court and if it involves a tax, then the litigant must be someone against whom the tax has already been levied and the tax has already been paid. only if the tax has been levied against the litigant and the tax has been paid do the courts recognize standing by that litigant to be before the court to make argument over any complaint. so they had to deal with that issue because not only does a litigant not have standing to even stay in court if they are arguing about a tax and the tax has not been levied and the tax has not been paid, but the federal court itself has no jurisdiction to even hear the controversy until the tax is levied and the tax is paid. so chief justice roberts had the difficult problem of investigating and ruling on whether or not the mandate and the penalty that comes if you don't purchase what is required by the federal government--is that a penalty or is that a tax? because if it is a tax, the law is very clear. we will have to rule that the plaintiffs do not have standing and their case be thrown out. and, similarly, we will rule that the court does not have jurisdiction. the case, as it is said in court, is not ripe for litigation. so it will have to be thrown out. if the court found that the penalty imposed by the federal government for not being a loyal american subject and buying a product that the monarchy or the growing dictatorship here says you have to buy--if it is a penalty, then you can come to court. we do have jurisdiction, and you do have standing. so chief justice roberts went through and ably explained how congress called it a penalty. at that time, of course, the democrats were in the majority here in the house as well as the senate. the democratic leadership, the democratic supporters in favor of obamacare, had made it clear this is a penalty. chief justice roberts cited that, that congress should know better than anyone else whether this is a penalty or it is a tax. because if it is a penalty, again, the litigant can be here and have standing. we have got jurisdiction. but if it is a tax, we have to throw it out. we can't hear the case, not now. he said congress should know better than anyone. they decided it was a penalty. not only that, but it really does appear to be a penalty because obamacare says: you have to buy insurance and you have to buy a product we say is okay. you can't buy what you want. you have to buy what we say you must buy. and if you don't do that, we will impose a financial penalty on you. i am hearing more and more young people who are really perplexed: yes. the government is giving me a subsidy to help me pay for my insurance, but my insurance has 5-, 6-, 7-, $8,000 of a threshold that i have to meet before it ever helps me with a dime of insurance help. so am i better off getting the government subsidy, paying all this money that is really making my life miserable, or should i go ahead and pay the new income tax that i have added on to me for not having insurance as is dictated? i think chief justice roberts came to a proper conclusion. this truly is a penalty. it is not a tax because it is only paid if you violate the mandate that the federal government dictated. so, clearly, it is a penalty. so there at page 1415 of the opinion, chief justice roberts concludes: okay. congress says it is a penalty. it obviously is a penalty. if you don't want to pay the penalty, then buy the insurance. you won't have the penalty. it is clearly a penalty. since it is a penalty, the anti-injunction act does not apply. therefore, the plaintiffs do have standing, and not only do they have standing, but this court has jurisdiction. now, because it is a penalty and not a tax, we have jurisdiction. so now we will proceed to consider the primary cause before us, whether or not the federal government can mandate for the first time in history that all of the american people buy a product that it dictates. then he went through and determined, if you say the commerce clause justifies federal jurisdiction here, then the commerce clause has no limits, has no meaning. and we choose to find that the commerce clause has meaning. therefore, this is unconstitutional under the commerce clause. but, then again, about 40 pages after he says it is not a tax, it is a penalty, chief justice roberts plays the mental gymnastics of arriving at saying: you know what. it turns out this really is not a penalty. it is a tax. and since it is a tax, a majority of us will find that it is constitutional. and so the federal government can impose a mandate requiring that all american citizens be loyal subjects, subject to the dictatorship here in washington, buy whatever product we tell them to buy. and all of that is because the supreme court rewrote the law and called it a tax. that is why the supreme court is struggling the way it is today. because when you create an abomination, you violate the constitution to the extent, you violate your conscience the way it was before it got so clouded with politics. you violate the constitution and then you create the kind of mess that is before the supreme court today. it is incredible to sit and listen to the supreme court struggling over this issue of just how far we can go to violate someone's religious beliefs. i didn't hear any one of the justices refer to the first amendment, that the government will establish no religion and not violate--or not prohibit the free exercise thereof. my friend, keith rothfus, a fellow member of congress, was sitting beside me. he got sworn in as a member of the supreme court bar today. keith rothfus was pointing out that, in one of the prior supreme court decisions back in the 1960s, they actually had a footnote where they listed a lot of the religions that they found currently in the united states. it was a fairly full list. but one of the religions in the united states recognized by the supreme court in the early 1960s was secular humanism. as keith rothfus and i agreed, we have now come to the point where we are violating the first amendment of the constitution. and not only are we violating the restraint against the federal government prohibiting the free exercise of religion, as it is doing for east texas baptist university, houston baptist university, little sisters of the poor, [[page h1577]] so many organizations that are religious in nature, but they have violated the part that said we will have no establishment of religion. the founders were thinking specifically about the church of england and how the king didn't like the way the vatican was ruling. and so he just created his own church, the church of england. he said: everybody has got to participate in my church now. they didn't want that to ever happen where the government of the land could dictate the religion that people had to practice. yet, that is what the supreme court has now done because it has now recognized secular humanism--not just recognized, but established secular humanism--as the state-sponsored religion in america. with the ruling last summer, the supreme court, in effect, said: since the 1960s, we have been limiting people's ability to use the word god, to pray to god, to read god's word, the bible. we have been prohibiting that for 40 or so years, 50 years maybe, and we have been protecting what moses said was the word of god and what jesus said was the word of god for far too long. they basically established secular humanism as the official religion of the united states. by their pronouncement, they were saying to forget what moses said god said, forget what jesus said. when jesus actually was asked about marriage and divorce, he quoted moses verbatim: a man shall leave his father and mother, a woman leave her home. the two will become one flesh. then jesus added, not just quoting moses as to what moses said god said about marriage: and what god has joined together, let nobody take apart. the supreme court last summer said: the effect of the ruling is not only can you not talk about god publicly or pray or read the bible, thank god we have speech and debate clause privileges here on this floor where i am actually free to even mention the word god. we pray every day to start our official day here in session. but the supreme court ruled, in effect: we are your god. the five of us in the majority of the supreme court are now your god. forget what we said in our prior decisions about marriage. it was not mentioned in the constitution. therefore, under the 10th amendment, it is reserved to the states and the people. forget the fact that we have talked before about the states will decide what marriage is. forget our ruling on doma, the defense of marriage act, passed by congress, where we made very clear that the states only have the right to decide what marriage is. forget all that. now we five majority justices are your god. and forget the fact that we--at least two of us have violated the federal law in order to reach this decision. because the federal law is very clear. if a judge--a federal judge, magistrate, justice might have their impartiality--his or her impartiality questioned, then they should disqualify--they shall disqualify themselves from sitting on the case. so we had two justices. not only was their opinion and their impartiality in question, there was actually no question that they were not impartial because they had both participated in same-sex wedding ceremonies. and justice ginsburg, who is a very nice lady, actually said--as maureen dowd pointed out in her article, she emphasized as she pronounced them married by virtue of the laws of the--and she said she really hammered the words--by the constitution of the united states. {time} 1230 so, clearly, we had justice kagan and justice ginsburg perform same- sex marriages before they were not impartial. the law required them to disqualify themselves. i have had some people say: well, wouldn't it have disqualified any of the other judges if they had ever participated in a marriage between a man and a woman? the answer is very easily and clearly no, because that was the law. the question is: can a government prohibit same-sex marriage? it was same-sex marriage that was before the court, not can a government prohibit marriage between a man and a woman. if the question had been: can a government prohibit marriage between a man and a woman, then that might be a different story. but that was not the issue before the court. two justices were disqualified. they had made their opinion clearly known in advance. there were other judges who had been asked, as i understand it, to do weddings, but they said: no, that might create a question of my impartiality and would require me to disqualify myself. well, their participation did certainly disqualify them. they refused to disqualify themselves. so two justices, as a minimum, were disqualified as they participated in the majority of five. so when you have an unconstitutional ruling by the united states supreme court, when the chief justice has to commit to the mental gymnastics, the loop-the-loops that he has to try to do to get around saying the mandate to purchase a policy that carries a penalty, is a penalty, and then over here we know he said it is a penalty over there, but now we are saying it is a tax, not a penalty, they created a nightmare for any legitimate judge with a conscience in trying to decide: now that we have blown apart any constitutional lines, where do we draw the lines now? it is rather tragic. justice kennedy was questioning one of the religious litigant's attorneys and made the statement, basically, that the court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that if we give an exemption to a church, we then have to give it to all other religious institutions. well, that statement deeply troubled me as well because it means that justice kennedy does not understand the constitutional prohibition in the first amendment. you are not on the supreme court or in congress or in the presidency to ever establish a religion. and it has been established. it is called secular humanism, which the supreme court has recognized as a religion. that is what is being established now. you are also not to prohibit the free exercise of religion. when the supreme court gets to the point, as justice kennedy is, that we on this court--at least a majority--will find it very hard to say that if you are not a part of a church and acting as that church, then you have no right to practice any of your religious beliefs that five of us don't like, that is tragic. i keep coming back to that prophetic statement by benjamin franklin when he was asked after the constitutional convention by a dear lady: what did you give us? ``a republic, madam, if you can keep it.'' why would he say ``if you can keep it?'' the reason he said that is--as he knew--the nature of government is to take more and more power and authority over individual rights and individual liberties. and in order to keep a republic, as ben franklin called it, you have to teach generation after generation that there are responsibilities that come with citizenship. because if you don't live up to those responsibilities, you will lose the republic, madam. you can't keep it. we have done a miserable job of teaching the next generation about how you would keep a republic. instead of being taught, as i was, in school the dangers of socialism, the dangers of communism, and that it always has to result in a dictatorship or a totalitarian government, that it requires people's rights be taken away, our founders say that we have to recognize these rights are a gift from our creator, from god, because if we say they are a gift of the government, then what the government giveth, the government can taketh away. we have legislators and judges who have not been properly educated on the manner in which you keep a republic, madam. it really has been heartbreaking when very smart young people ask sincerely: i understand socialism is supposed to be wrong, communism is supposed to be wrong, but it really sounds nice. can you explain why it would be wrong? because i don't get it. it sounds nice. as the new testament church started out, as the pilgrims' compact started out, you bring into the common storehouse, and then you share and share alike. you share from those according to their ability to those according to their need. of course, more than one parent has explained socialism to their children [[page h1578]] by saying: look, you got an a. i know how hard you were working every night doing your homework, but your friend over here got a c. i saw her out partying a lot of times when you were here studying. and she is not maybe quite as smart as you are, so she got a c, you got an a. the socialist notion is that we have to give everybody a b. so we will make this a a b, we will make this c a b, and everybody will feel better for it. mr. speaker, i have shared this before, but it was such a lesson to me as an exchange student to the soviet union being out at a collective farm. the farmers were sitting in the shade in midmorning, when anybody back home in east texas knows that--especially in july, like it was-- you start early and you try to finish early before the sun gets too hot. it is midmorning. this is prime time to be working before it gets too hot. and here are all the farmers sitting in the shade in the middle of their village. trying to use the best russian i could--i had 2 years, which meant i could converse ably with a 4-year-old--i asked: when do you work out in the field? i couldn't tell what they cultivated and didn't. it all looked brown. none of it looked very good. i would have expected in texas that those fields would have been green, looking good, and the weeds out. you couldn't tell what was weeds and what wasn't. i said: when do you work out in the field? they laughed, and i thought i must not have translated that right. then one of them said in russian, basically: i make the same number of rubles if i am out there in the field in the sun or if i am here in the shade. so i am here in the shade. i have carried that with me all these years. that is why socialism can't work. it is why socialism or communism--again, bringing all into the common storehouse, share and sharing alike--can never work on this earth, in this world. because the only way you will ever have share and share alike, as they found out in the new testament church, the only way you can make it work is if you have a totalitarian government that says: you will do what we say. and then there goes your freedoms. so the only way to have the maximum amount of freedom is to have a self-governing republic so people can govern themselves by electing people that they have interviewed, they have read all about, done plenty of research on, and then they come forward on hiring day-- otherwise known as election day--and they vote to hire the person that they want for their public servant. that is the way it is supposed to work. people have not obliged themselves of the need that in order to keep a republic, you have to do the research on the candidates that have applied for your job. you have a requirement, a need, for you to actually come out and vote. look, i get it. there are so many i have heard from that are disenfranchised voters. they say: we hear about all these people. john fund has a great book out on the fraud that has been in so many of our modern elections that is not being dealt with, despite what the government says. it is a great book. people find out there is fraud. since they didn't have to have a photo id like you have to have to buy cigarettes or alcohol or get on a plane or anything else, you can manipulate the system, you can vote more than one time. my friend from south texas told me about some of the people who were illegally in the country being approached with voter registration forms, saying: fill these out. if you don't want to use your own address here, just use one central address. you can all use the same address. some of them were worried about showing an id. they will figure out we are illegally in this country and we are not supposed to vote. they were assured: no, no. president obama's lawyer--eric holder at that time--has gotten a judge to rule that they can't require an id and, therefore, all you have to do is fill this out. but if you don't fill this out, then republicans are going to take away your welfare, they are going to take away your health care, and they are going to try to make you leave the country. so you have got to fill this out. and even though it is illegal, there is nothing wrong with doing it. you will get the voter registration card in the mail to the address you give them, and then you just go vote and that is all you have to show them. thankfully, we have voter id now in texas. but there are so many people who have been disenfranchised, because they say: there is so much voter fraud going on. why should i even bother? my vote doesn't count like somebody that votes more than once. we are in grave danger of losing this republic. we are not going to keep it much longer the way we are going. we haven't educated future generations to how you go about keeping a self-governing republic. some have been miseducated to think socialism, which has failed every single time it has ever been tried--it will always fail. we haven't educated them about the truth of freedom and what is required to keep it. justice scalia told a group from my hometown that was here that the reason we are the most free nation in history is not because we had the best bill of rights, but because the founders didn't trust government. they wanted gridlock. they wanted it as difficult as possible to pass laws, because with the passage of every law is the risk that some freedom will be taken away by the big government. {time} 1245 the founders knew that, and they made it hard to pass laws. that is not a bad thing. it is a good thing. but when he mentioned that the soviet union had a better bill of rights than we had, i remembered, i did a paper back in college when i was at texas a&m. after i had visited the soviet union as an exchange student, i wrote a paper on their system. but i had done a paper on their bill of rights, their constitution. i was shocked at the extent of the rights that were guaranteed to the soviet union citizens. i was also surprised to find that, in the early sixties, the premier, khrushchev, in the soviet union, had set up a commission, because those that had truly been educated on the different forms of government and governing know that, actually, true communism is only when there is no government, that it is like reaching for nirvana. you eventually reach the point where everybody is so sharing and so giving--taking from their ability, giving to the need--they are so giving that you don't even need a government anymore. so khrushchev set up a commission basically charged with coming up with a plan to reach that ultimate goal where someday there will be no government and we will have true communism in its purest form, no government, everyone giving, sharing, lovingly. and i read that, after a couple of years of that commission trying to figure out, ``how are we ever going to come up with a plan that eventuates in having no government and everybody always sharing equally? how are we going to ever pull that off?'' they couldn't come up with a way to reach that in this world, in this life, and so khrushchev disbanded the commission. there was no way to get there. they were right. if you are going to have communism or socialism, you are going to have to have a totalitarian government, whether it is an individual dictator or a political group like they have or used to have at the kremlin. you have got to have ruling autocrats, an oligarch, monarch, in order to force everybody to take from those who have worked hard, according to their ability, and giving to those who either can't work or choose not to work. the only way you can maximize freedoms is when people in the country understand what franklin understood: you have got a republic if you can keep it. we are not being vigilant to keep our republic, and that is why so many are desperate now as they vote for a presidential candidate. and even christian friends have said, you know, i understand there is a time and place for a david with a slingshot, complete faith in god, and a clear great ability with a slingshot. i know there is a time for that. but right now, our freedoms have been so badly eroded, we are losing the government. we are having people come in and start voting without understanding how you preserve a republic. we are losing the country. we are losing the melting pot that we once were, welcoming people [[page h1579]] from all over and coming together and being molded into one thing, not a hyphenated american, but an american. we are losing that. you see many voters standing in lines now. they didn't used to ever do this, stand in line for hours. you found people do that in africa when they are finally afforded an opportunity to vote for the first time in their lives. but now, in america, some people are waiting hours to vote because they see that we have not been vigilant in protecting our republic, and just as franklin worried, we are about to lose it. we are already losing it when the government can dictate that individuals buy a product, when the government can say you can only practice your religious beliefs if you are within the confines of a church, but if you are an individual, like the founders were, who held tightly to their religious beliefs--they talked about it as they passed legislation; they talked about it as they created our constitution--the supreme court is now saying: secular humanism is what we must have; it is what we demand. and since we are in charge and we are moving toward being socialistic, you have got to have an oligarchy, and we are it. obviously, they don't say it in those words, but that is what their actions say, and that is why, when a justice says: well, this court would find it very hard to write an opinion saying that we were moving the line from beyond a church and extending that line out to other religious institutions--like the little sisters of the poor, these wonderful, superb christian women who have given their lives doing what jesus said, ministering to others, feeding his sheep, ministering to their physical needs, their healthcare needs--and the supreme court says: we have a lot of trouble. see, they are not actually a church. they are a religious institution, and we are going to have a hard time writing an opinion that moves the line to protect religious opinions. my word, shouldn't have any trouble drawing a line at individuals. any individual in the united states of america who has a deeply held, sincerely held religious belief, it was meant to be protected, unless it is completely anathema to our constitution. sharia law is anathema; and to the extent that some believe they should replace our constitution with their sharia law, then that is treason if they are here in this country. but otherwise, their religious belief should be recognized, and god help us if the court doesn't do it right. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time.

PETER J. ROSKAM of illinois in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor a distinguished public servant, Carol Bauer, for 50 years of service to the Village of Lombard. Carol has dedicated her life to Lombard and her service is a truly impressive feat. She serves as a role model for us all and as proof that one dedicated person can change the lives of many. In 1966, Carol started full time for the village of Lombard as a fire and police dispatcher. Since that time she has had the role of Executive Secretary and coordinator for the Lombard Blood Drive, and has been an asset to numerous presidents, managers, and board members, who have been a part of Lombard Village Hall. While working full time for her community, Carol took over the Village's blood drive in 1993. At the time, the village hosted two blood drives per year and usually collected 25 to 30 pints of blood. Carol believed they could do better and wanted to save people's lives so she dedicated herself to the cause. Now the Village hosts five blood drives per year and collects approximately 200 pints per drive. In 2013, Carol was named the most dedicated blood coordinator in Illinois by Heartland Blood Centers. Since her days as a dispatcher, Carol has never stopped working to improve her community and has no plans of stopping on account of her 50th anniversary. When asked if she was retiring, she said, ``Oh, no. I am not. It's such a big part of my life. If I can make some little dent in the community, some little mark that something is better, then I want to continue doing that.'' Through hard work and no small amount of perseverance, Carol Bauer has helped countless people and tremendously improved her community. Distinguished Members, please join me in congratulating Carol on 50 years of service and many more to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E365] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CAROL BAUER ON 50 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE VILLAGE OF LOMBARD ______ HON.

ANDER CRENSHAW of florida in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the veterans who served our country during the Vietnam War. On March 29, 2016, a Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War will be held at the Jacksonville National Cemetery as part of a 13-year program to honor and give thanks to the men and women who defended freedom in Vietnam. The Vietnam War was one of the longest conflicts American forces have known and one of the most deadly. Before the war ended in 1975, over 58,000 Americans would die and another 304,000 would be wounded. We do not have to relate those statistics to our Vietnam Veterans. They know them by heart. It has been said that no event in American history is more misunderstood than the Vietnam War. It was misreported then, and it is misremembered now. History has told us that unlike in other wars, our troops were not driving across a country to hold land and capture territory. Many of the missions were designed to find and harass a jungle-hidden enemy, inflict casualties, and fall back to a well- protected base. Our troops fought in canopied jungles, rugged mountains, on rivers, and through swampy lowlands. Many spent days-- weeks--in wet rice paddies far from any base. They fought for the noble cause of protecting the ideals we cherish as Americans. During our Commemoration, we will gather to thank them for their sacrifices and for the incredible dangers and hardships they endured for our country and for the ideals of freedom. This ceremony is a small gesture of grateful appreciation for the service these veterans gave our country. Each year I hold a ceremony to recognize veterans. I have been honored to learn the stories of more than 500 Vietnam Veterans over the years. In citations that accompanied the many medals they received, these veterans were commended as members of our Nation's and the free world's most versatile and potent striking forces. It was in Vietnam that helicopter-based, air-mobile operations first demonstrated their combat potential. Some were shot down; some wounded; and many served multiple tours. Collectively, veterans in my District received hundreds of medals including Bronze and Silver Stars and, of course, Purple Hearts. Several were POWs for long, agonizing years. Their service included jumping from aircraft despite enemy sniper fire to go to the rescue of downed soldiers trapped in battle. They worked tirelessly to direct tactical air strikes and artillery fire so their comrades could be airlifted to safety. They flew over the Red River into North Vietnam, and patrolled the brown waters of the Mekong River. They drove trucks through hostile territory to supply fellow soldiers and marines and ferried the injured to safety. Nurses and doctors administered aid and pastors heard too many final words. They provided maintenance to keep planes ready. Some walked through jungles and rice paddies and claimed they were just grunts. But, for those in the field there was often no hot chow, no showers, and no clean socks. For them, the fight was often against the weather, the red ants, the scorpions, and the leeches. The nights were long and punctuated with the distinct sounds of AK rounds, grenades, and M-16s. They sought out and destroyed the enemy and defended key airfields and routes of communication while extending protection to millions of South Vietnamese. They did their duty and tried hard to leave no one behind. The memory of lost comrades never subsides. Their names are beautifully remembered on The Wall in Washington, D.C. Each [[Page E366]] name engraved in the black granite has a story that speaks volumes about bravery, ingenuity, and drama. When people say, freedom isn't free--the names on The Wall seem to answer, ``It was paid for by me.'' The Commemoration ceremony in Jacksonville is a tribute to the service of all who served during that turbulent time. The unrelenting combat spirit and initiative of Vietnam Veterans bears testimony to individual acts of personal heroism and daring. Their loyalty, diligence, and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military services and reflect great credit upon them and our country. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and Members of the House to join me in thanking our Vietnam Veterans for their valiant fighting spirit, perseverance, resolute courage, and selfless devotion to duty to each other and to our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E365-E366] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE COMMEMORATION CEREMONY FOR VIETNAM VETERANS AT THE JACKSONVILLE NATIONAL CEMETERY IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA ______ HON.

On March 29, 2016, a Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War will be held at the Jacksonville National Cemetery as part of a 13-year program to honor and give thanks to the men and women who defended freedom in Vietnam. The Vietnam War was one of the longest conflicts American forces have known and one of the most deadly. Before the war ended in 1975, over 58,000 Americans would die and another 304,000 would be wounded. We do not have to relate those statistics to our Vietnam Veterans. They know them by heart. It has been said that no event in American history is more misunderstood than the Vietnam War. It was misreported then, and it is misremembered now. History has told us that unlike in other wars, our troops were not driving across a country to hold land and capture territory. Many of the missions were designed to find and harass a jungle-hidden enemy, inflict casualties, and fall back to a well- protected base. Our troops fought in canopied jungles, rugged mountains, on rivers, and through swampy lowlands. Many spent days-- weeks--in wet rice paddies far from any base. They fought for the noble cause of protecting the ideals we cherish as Americans. During our Commemoration, we will gather to thank them for their sacrifices and for the incredible dangers and hardships they endured for our country and for the ideals of freedom. This ceremony is a small gesture of grateful appreciation for the service these veterans gave our country. Each year I hold a ceremony to recognize veterans. I have been honored to learn the stories of more than 500 Vietnam Veterans over the years. In citations that accompanied the many medals they received, these veterans were commended as members of our Nation's and the free world's most versatile and potent striking forces. It was in Vietnam that helicopter-based, air-mobile operations first demonstrated their combat potential. Some were shot down; some wounded; and many served multiple tours. Collectively, veterans in my District received hundreds of medals including Bronze and Silver Stars and, of course, Purple Hearts. Several were POWs for long, agonizing years. Their service included jumping from aircraft despite enemy sniper fire to go to the rescue of downed soldiers trapped in battle. They worked tirelessly to direct tactical air strikes and artillery fire so their comrades could be airlifted to safety. They flew over the Red River into North Vietnam, and patrolled the brown waters of the Mekong River. They drove trucks through hostile territory to supply fellow soldiers and marines and ferried the injured to safety. Nurses and doctors administered aid and pastors heard too many final words. They provided maintenance to keep planes ready. Some walked through jungles and rice paddies and claimed they were just grunts. But, for those in the field there was often no hot chow, no showers, and no clean socks. For them, the fight was often against the weather, the red ants, the scorpions, and the leeches. The nights were long and punctuated with the distinct sounds of AK rounds, grenades, and M-16s. They sought out and destroyed the enemy and defended key airfields and routes of communication while extending protection to millions of South Vietnamese. They did their duty and tried hard to leave no one behind. The memory of lost comrades never subsides. Their names are beautifully remembered on The Wall in Washington, D.C. Each [[Page E366]] name engraved in the black granite has a story that speaks volumes about bravery, ingenuity, and drama. When people say, freedom isn't free--the names on The Wall seem to answer, ``It was paid for by me.'' The Commemoration ceremony in Jacksonville is a tribute to the service of all who served during that turbulent time. The unrelenting combat spirit and initiative of Vietnam Veterans bears testimony to individual acts of personal heroism and daring. Their loyalty, diligence, and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military services and reflect great credit upon them and our country. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and Members of the House to join me in thanking our Vietnam Veterans for their valiant fighting spirit, perseverance, resolute courage, and selfless devotion to duty to each other and to our country. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E365-E366] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE COMMEMORATION CEREMONY FOR VIETNAM VETERANS AT THE JACKSONVILLE NATIONAL CEMETERY IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA ______ HON.

Nader, who died peacefully at his home in Northbrook, Illinois, on February 16, 2016, at the age of 78. Allan was the younger of two sons of Olga and Joshua Nader. He attended Lake View High School and was a graduate of the Illinois Institute of Technology. He received a Master's Degree in Science from Western Michigan University, and a Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry from Purdue. After receiving his Doctorate, Allan began his career as a research scientist at DuPont, a post he held for 28 years. He then worked with his brother, Albert, at Questar and taught chemistry at Triton College and Northwestern University. He was part of INVO-Innovations and New Ventures at Northwestern, where he received the Office of Research Star Award in 2014 and the Outstanding Employee of the Year Award in 2015. Allan Nader was a man of deep and abiding faith and was deeply devoted to his church and his family. He was an unwavering believer in education and mentored many young people. He was a dear friend to many, and I will always be grateful to count myself among them. Allan Nader leaves his wife, Helen, the great love of his life for over 50 years, his daughter Cara, who was the joy of his life, and Cara's husband George, who became a true son to him. The prophet Micah wrote: ``What is good has been explained to you; this is what Yahweh asks of you: Only this, to act justly, to love tenderly and to walk humbly with your God.'' This is how Allan Nader lived his life. Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life of a great and good man, Allan E. Nader, and in extending our condolences to his wife, his entire family and his many friends. Our country is stronger and better because of his integrity, patriotism, brilliance, mentoring and faith.

ANDER CRENSHAW of florida in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the new United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and United States Coast Guard (USCG) building that is being dedicated on March 30, 2016 in Florida's Fourth Congressional District. Thanks to several years of dedication and focus on the common goal of maritime safety and border protection, both offices can now operate in one building. This achievement means a safer and more secure First Coast, through an efficient and effective USCG/CBP operation. The road to this achievement has been a long one. USCG and CBP personnel are tasked with keeping our waterways safe and our borders secure. However, since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003, these agencies were never provided adequate office space and were forced to consolidate. Later in 2007, CBP/USCG Senior Guidance recommended the construction of a new joint CBP/USCG facility in Jacksonville. The idea of a one- stop shop for maritime security would streamline and improve joint field operations while also reducing facility costs. Acquiring this building was no easy task because local CBP and USCG had to clear the hurdle of a heavy bureaucratic process. As Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, I kept a close eye on the process on Capitol Hill. Thanks to the continued leadership of the local CBP/USCG offices, the goal of this facility was never abandoned. Now, with personnel, assets, and more importantly, strategic capabilities all headquartered in one building, the facility will serve as the cornerstone of maritime security for years to come. The center is immensely important to a community like Jacksonville, and I am honored to have played a role in acquiring it. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E367] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEW UNITED STATES CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AND UNITED STATES COAST GUARD BUILDING IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA ______ HON.

DANIEL M. DONOVAN, JR. of new york in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former Staten Island resident Aziz Memon's endless commitment to rid the world of polio. Born in modern-day Mumbai, India to Pakistani parents, Aziz has always been a very self-motivated and socially-aware individual. This former Staten Islander is the very definition of altruism. From his first job teaching senior citizens at the age of thirteen, he has risen to become the Chairman of the Kings Group, a conglomerate of six companies in industries ranging from textiles to property development. In 1995, Aziz joined Rotary International, a global network of volunteer business and professional leaders that provides humanitarian services and works towards a better and more peaceful world. He served as President of the Rotary Club of Karachi in Pakistan from 2003 to 2004, as well as Governor of Rotary International District 3270, Pakistan and Afghanistan from 2007 to 2008. Aziz has dedicated much of his time to eradicating polio in Pakistan, a country where the virus has been declared a national emergency and a global public health emergency by the Pakistani government and the World Health Organization, respectively. In the face of threats from the Taliban, which has banned polio vaccination and murdered those who have dared to defy them, Aziz has courageously continued his work to improve the lives of those less fortunate. He is currently the national chairman of Rotary International's Pakistan Polio Plus Committee. He has facilitated the opening of several health centers and has provided financial support to families of fieldworkers killed by the Taliban. He has received several awards in recognition of selfless dedication, including the Pride of Performance from the President of Pakistan and the Regional Service Award from Rotary International. Mr. Speaker, Aziz Memon's dedication to serving humanity and improving the global community is the essence of a model humanitarian. I thank him for all of his great work and I am proud to honor this great man who has consistently put others before himself. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E367] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING AZIZ MEMON ______ HON.

Among the casualties that night was S/SGT Gerald V. Aldrich II of the United States Air Force. S/ SGT Aldrich perished while in service to his country, and though we may never fully comprehend the grief felt by his mother, Hazel Aldrich Wattles, his wife, Petra, his two sons, Timothy and Joshua, and his sister, Sherry Roley, they may rest assured that they have my heartfelt condolences on their loss and the appreciation of a grateful nation. S/SGT Aldrich, who grew up in Louisville, Illinois, graduated from North Clay High School with high honors, and turned down more lucrative job offers for a career in the Air Force, died on Good Friday, April 3, 1996. So it only seems appropriate to look to the Bible for strength. Psalm 46:1 tells us that ``God is our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble.''

PETER J. ROSKAM of illinois in the house of representatives Wednesday March 23, 2016 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to recognize the long and distinguished service of Rolling Meadows Police Department Chief Dan Scanlan and congratulate him on the occasion of his retirement. On May 16th of this year, Chief Scanlan will conclude his loyal service to the community of Rolling Meadows and the surrounding area. Chief Scanlan began his career with Rolling Meadows, as a patrolman, 34 years ago in 1982. He spent 10 years as a tactical officer and gang specialist before he eventually moved up the ranks and became chief of the Rolling Meadows police department in 2009. Under Chief Scanlan's leadership, the Rolling Meadows Police Department implemented a number of programs to foster community outreach, crime prevention, and operational efficiencies. These programs include the Safe Schools Initiative--a partnership between law enforcement and local schools to identify and implement strategies to improve student safety and the community bike ride, which is an event where police officers and residents join together for a late summer ride around Rolling Meadows. Throughout his career, his extraordinary leadership has earned him great respect among colleagues and members of the community. City Manager Barry Krumstok described Chief Scanlon by saying, ``Dave Scanlan has been a faithful, loyal, tireless professional who has always made sure the department maintains the highest levels of police services. His collaborative leadership style encourages creativity and innovation. His willingness to listen to residents' concerns reflects his unyielding commitment to community service.'' A true servant of Rolling Meadows, his ability to foster engagement and his dedication to the city will be greatly missed.

CREC-2016-03-23-pt1-PgE368-2,CREC-2016-03-23,114,RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E368] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION ______ HON. MICHAEL M. HONDA of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10th anniversary of the Korea International Trade Association (KITA) Washington Center. Located at 1660 L Street, NW, in the heart of the commercial center of the city, the building has played an important role in KITA's effort to promote trade and bilateral investment by providing facilities and services on a reciprocal basis. The KITA Washington Center is one of nine overseas branches in major global cities that are augmented by twelve domestic offices to comprise and consolidate KITA's position as the preeminent business organization in Korea. In Silicon Valley, the heart of my district, we've been at the cutting edge of innovation in nanotechnology, semiconductors, clean energy, telecommunications, cloud computing, digital media, and many other exciting frontiers. As Korea looks for more investment opportunities, and as we capitalize on synergies among institutions in the Bay Area and Korea, our economic relationship will get stronger and stronger. Korea has invested significantly in Silicon Valley to leverage our cutting edge innovation. From major global companies like Samsung Electronics to the KOTRA Silicon Valley IT Center in Santa Clara that boasts over 40 Korean firms seeking to network and seek potential funders, the economic synergy between Korea and my district has never been greater. That is why I have committed to continuing to foster this important bilateral economic and investment relationship. In December 2014, I had the privilege of visiting Korea to promote Silicon Valley ties to the country. I had the honor of a courtesy visit with President Park Geun-Hye and many Korean Government leaders to discuss a broad range of issues. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to participate in a business roundtable hosted by then Chairman of KITA and former Korean Ambassador to the United States, Duk-Soo Han. It was an important visit that helped to further the economic and trade ties between Korea and my district. The Korea International Trade Association was established in 1946 with the objective of advancing the Korean economy through trade and investment, and is currently the largest business organization in Korea with over 71,000 member companies. On July 31 of this year, KITA will auspiciously mark its 70th anniversary. Taking the opportunity, I wish to extend my congratulations to KITA's Chairman, In-Ho Kim. Since Korea's trade volume reached 1 billion dollars in 1967, the country has achieved remarkable economic growth over the past few decades, becoming the ninth country in the world in 2011 to attain a trillion-dollar trade volume. This has signified a new opportunity for Korea to engage in exports, imports and foreign investment. For nearly seven decades, KITA has organized various functions and events to enhance mutual understanding on trade issues, seeking to resolve private-sector disputes through dialogue. It has also worked together with its overseas counterparts and international economic organizations to provide member firms with opportunities to interact fully with the international community. Moreover, KITA places special emphasis on developing and maintaining cooperative relationships with overseas trade promotion. These cooperation activities include trade information exchange, organizing trade promotional events, joint research, business matchmaking, regional trade missions and the provision of facilities, such as the KITA Washington Office building on L Street. It's in both the United States and Korea's interests that we forge a strong economic relationship that ensures sustained and balanced growth for both countries through greater bilateral investment. To this end, KITA's role will continue to be both meaningful and necessary for our economies are tightly intertwined. With Korea's rapid economic growth since the 1960's, the emergence of business centers in new markets, and the rise of their middle class, Korea's demand for American goods will continue to break historic records. President Obama has made it a top priority of his administration to grow American jobs through increasing exports. About every $1 billion in exports creates about 5,000 jobs at home. If we double our exports, that would be 2 million new American jobs. Since the President made boosting exports a top priority in his 2010 State of the Union speech our exports are up about 33 percent across all sectors. Manufactured goods are up 33 percent, agriculture is up 34 percent, and services are up almost 20 percent in just about every country in which we trade. Ninety-five percent of U.S. exporters are small businesses. United States exports to South Korea supported more than 119,000 jobs across the U.S. in 2012. That's an increase of 28 percent over a decade. South Korea is our seventh largest bilateral trading partner, and the U.S. is South Korea's third largest. 29 U.S. States have more than doubled exports over the last decade. In fact, I am extremely proud that my congressional district leads the country in exports to Korea, with almost $900 million, as of 2012. Mr. Speaker, I want to again extend my good wishes and recognize KITA Washington Office on its 10th anniversary and I encourage my colleagues in the House of Representatives to do the same. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E368] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION ______ HON.

online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing the 10th anniversary of the korean international trade association ______ hon. michael m. honda of california in the house of representatives wednesday, march 23, 2016 mr. honda. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize the 10th anniversary of the korea international trade association (kita) washington center. located at 1660 l street, nw, in the heart of the commercial center of the city, the building has played an important role in kita's effort to promote trade and bilateral investment by providing facilities and services on a reciprocal basis. the kita washington center is one of nine overseas branches in major global cities that are augmented by twelve domestic offices to comprise and consolidate kita's position as the preeminent business organization in korea. in silicon valley, the heart of my district, we've been at the cutting edge of innovation in nanotechnology, semiconductors, clean energy, telecommunications, cloud computing, digital media, and many other exciting frontiers. as korea looks for more investment opportunities, and as we capitalize on synergies among institutions in the bay area and korea, our economic relationship will get stronger and stronger. korea has invested significantly in silicon valley to leverage our cutting edge innovation. from major global companies like samsung electronics to the kotra silicon valley it center in santa clara that boasts over 40 korean firms seeking to network and seek potential funders, the economic synergy between korea and my district has never been greater. that is why i have committed to continuing to foster this important bilateral economic and investment relationship. in december 2014, i had the privilege of visiting korea to promote silicon valley ties to the country. i had the honor of a courtesy visit with president park geun-hye and many korean government leaders to discuss a broad range of issues. furthermore, i had the opportunity to participate in a business roundtable hosted by then chairman of kita and former korean ambassador to the united states, duk-soo han. it was an important visit that helped to further the economic and trade ties between korea and my district. the korea international trade association was established in 1946 with the objective of advancing the korean economy through trade and investment, and is currently the largest business organization in korea with over 71,000 member companies. on july 31 of this year, kita will auspiciously mark its 70th anniversary. taking the opportunity, i wish to extend my congratulations to kita's chairman, in-ho kim. since korea's trade volume reached 1 billion dollars in 1967, the country has achieved remarkable economic growth over the past few decades, becoming the ninth country in the world in 2011 to attain a trillion-dollar trade volume. this has signified a new opportunity for korea to engage in exports, imports and foreign investment. for nearly seven decades, kita has organized various functions and events to enhance mutual understanding on trade issues, seeking to resolve private-sector disputes through dialogue. it has also worked together with its overseas counterparts and international economic organizations to provide member firms with opportunities to interact fully with the international community. moreover, kita places special emphasis on developing and maintaining cooperative relationships with overseas trade promotion. these cooperation activities include trade information exchange, organizing trade promotional events, joint research, business matchmaking, regional trade missions and the provision of facilities, such as the kita washington office building on l street. it's in both the united states and korea's interests that we forge a strong economic relationship that ensures sustained and balanced growth for both countries through greater bilateral investment. to this end, kita's role will continue to be both meaningful and necessary for our economies are tightly intertwined. with korea's rapid economic growth since the 1960's, the emergence of business centers in new markets, and the rise of their middle class, korea's demand for american goods will continue to break historic records. president obama has made it a top priority of his administration to grow american jobs through increasing exports. about every $1 billion in exports creates about 5,000 jobs at home. if we double our exports, that would be 2 million new american jobs. since the president made boosting exports a top priority in his 2010 state of the union speech our exports are up about 33 percent across all sectors. manufactured goods are up 33 percent, agriculture is up 34 percent, and services are up almost 20 percent in just about every country in which we trade. ninety-five percent of u.s. exporters are small businesses. united states exports to south korea supported more than 119,000 jobs across the u.s. in 2012. that's an increase of 28 percent over a decade. south korea is our seventh largest bilateral trading partner, and the u.s. is south korea's third largest. 29 u.s. states have more than doubled exports over the last decade. in fact, i am extremely proud that my congressional district leads the country in exports to korea, with almost $900 million, as of 2012. mr. speaker, i want to again extend my good wishes and recognize kita washington office on its 10th anniversary and i encourage my colleagues in the house of representatives to do the same. ____________________",5702

In their first year, the sorority bravely marched in the Woman Suffrage Parade exemplifying their mission to promote women's rights. Founder Florence Letcher Torns reflected on that day saying ``we marched that day in order that women might come into their own, because we believed that women not only needed an education, but they needed a broader horizon in which they may use that education. And the right to vote would give them that privilege.'' Since that time, Delta Sigma Theta has grown to reach over 200,000 women and currently boasts a membership of 1,000 collegiate and alumnae chapters located around the globe.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the ceremonial opening of Packard Health's Ypsilanti Health Center on Tuesday March 29th, 2016. Packard Health's two Ann Arbor locations have been serving all of Washtenaw County for the last 43 years. That means 43 years of serving our family, friends, and neighbors. From prenatal, pediatric, mental health, and chronic disease care, Packard Health works to provide the community with essential primary care needs. They have not only earned, but solidified their reputation as a vital community resource, providing health services to those who don't have access, or cannot afford health care. Beginning December 2015 this new Packard Health location in Ypsilanti has begun treating Washtenaw County's most underserved group of individuals in a more immediate way. Ypsilanti has been one of the hardest hit communities with respect to the recent economic down turn, with a poverty rate nearing 30 percent. Nearly 3 out of 10 people are living without the basic necessities many of us take for granted. Though our national conversation about health care has taken center stage over the last several years there are still far too many people living without the adequate health care coverage, and even more who lack access to doctors, nurses and facilities. I believe that health care is a basic and fundamental right, regardless of income, age, or background. This new Packard Health location in Ypsilanti is positioned to do the most good for so many of the individuals with the [[Page E370]] greatest need in Washtenaw County. Currently, Packard Health has treated over 8,000 patients annually; we can ensure that this coverage will now extend its reach into and through the Ypsilanti community. This new location extends the promise to our people to unlock their ability to lead healthier, happier, and more satisfied lives. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the opening of the new Ypsilanti Packard Health Center. I wish them the best of luck with their important work and success in their future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E369-E370] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE OPENING OF PACKARD HEALTH'S YPSILANTI HEALTH CENTER ______ HON.

JASON SMITH of missouri in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 75th anniversary of the Farmington Regional Chamber of Commerce of Farmington, Missouri. The application to form the chamber was signed by Edward B. Effrein as President; Charles S. Fitz as Vice-President; and Mack F. Denman as Secretary-Treasurer. The Chamber became a legal and active organization on July 2, 1941. Its mission has broadened over the years: to promote good government, hold meetings for the discussion of current questions, and improve the quality of life for the residents of Farmington. The Chamber was instrumental in bringing Trimfoot Shoe Company to the city as a major employer. In the 1950s the Chamber pushed for commercial development along the U.S. Highway 67 Bypass which today is known at Karsch Boulevard. The Chamber was instrumental in the creation of an industrial park; advocated for a state prison in Farmington; worked for educational issues; and led efforts to continue economic growth. It campaigned for the Farmington City Civic Center, improvements for the Farmington Regional Airport, construction of the Farmington Water Park and most recently, the construction of the new Farmington Public Library. The Chamber also led a team effort to have St. Francois County become a Certified Work Ready Community. From its year-long observance of Farmington's 200th anniversary in 1997 to its annual celebration of Country Days, the Farmington Regional Chamber of Commerce continues to focus on what's best about Farmington. Its outstanding efforts led the Missouri State Chamber of Commerce to honor it as the 2014 Chamber of the Year. In the years ahead, the Farmington Regional Chamber of Commerce will continue to help Farmington be one of the best communities in Missouri to live and work. It gives me great pleasure to recognize the impressive 75-year history and the promising future of the Farmington Regional Chamber of Commerce before the United States House of Representatives. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E369] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FARMINGTON REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ______ HON.

CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS of washington in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate 2016 as the International Year of Pulses. I am extremely proud to represent the Pulse farmers of Eastern Washington. Eastern Washington is one of the most fertile agricultural areas in the nation and is proud to add pulses, namely dry peas, beans, lentils and chickpeas to crops which feed the world. Pulses are a low fat source of protein with a high fiber content and low glycemic index. They typically contain twice the amount of protein found in whole grain cereals, and in most developing countries comprise the main source of protein. Pulses are so nutrient-dense that nutritionists consider them both a protein and a vegetable. Pulses are rich in vitamins and minerals, providing consumers iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc, and are abundant with B vitamins. They contribute to a balanced diet, and have been shown to lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes, lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Pulses can also play an important role in mitigating the harmful effects of human exposure to heavy metals, including lead, in communities across the United States. In addition, according to conservative estimates, pulse crops provide thousands of production and manufacturing jobs in rural communities across the country. In the states of Washington and Idaho alone, 2015 saw over 226 million pounds of dry peas, nearly 70 million pounds of lentils, and over 165 million pounds of chickpeas produced. Top chefs and households around the country are discovering these healthy, affordable, sustainable and delicious super foods. To help raise awareness of these crops, the United Nations declared 2016 as the International Year of Pulses. Pulses will play a major role in meeting future food needs as the world's growing population, which is set to require a 70 percent increase in agricultural production by 2050, because they are sustainable, nutritious, versatile, and affordable. Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of our colleagues join me in celebrating 2016 as the International Year of the Pulses. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E370] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING 2016 AS THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF PULSES ______ HON.

Pulses are so nutrient-dense that nutritionists consider them both a protein and a vegetable. Pulses are rich in vitamins and minerals, providing consumers iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc, and are abundant with B vitamins. They contribute to a balanced diet, and have been shown to lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes, lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Pulses can also play an important role in mitigating the harmful effects of human exposure to heavy metals, including lead, in communities across the United States. In addition, according to conservative estimates, pulse crops provide thousands of production and manufacturing jobs in rural communities across the country. In the states of Washington and Idaho alone, 2015 saw over 226 million pounds of dry peas, nearly 70 million pounds of lentils, and over 165 million pounds of chickpeas produced. Top chefs and households around the country are discovering these healthy, affordable, sustainable and delicious super foods. To help raise awareness of these crops, the United Nations declared 2016 as the International Year of Pulses. Pulses will play a major role in meeting future food needs as the world's growing population, which is set to require a 70 percent increase in agricultural production by 2050, because they are sustainable, nutritious, versatile, and affordable. Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of our colleagues join me in celebrating 2016 as the International Year of the Pulses. ____________________",package_114_292.csv,2445,2445,2515,"[congressional record volume 162, number 46 (wednesday, march 23, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e370] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] celebrating 2016 as the international year of pulses ______ hon. cathy mcmorris rodgers of washington in the house of representatives wednesday, march 23, 2016 mrs. mcmorris rodgers. mr. speaker, i rise to celebrate 2016 as the international year of pulses. i am extremely proud to represent the pulse farmers of eastern washington. eastern washington is one of the most fertile agricultural areas in the nation and is proud to add pulses, namely dry peas, beans, lentils and chickpeas to crops which feed the world. pulses are a low fat source of protein with a high fiber content and low glycemic index. they typically contain twice the amount of protein found in whole grain cereals, and in most developing countries comprise the main source of protein. pulses are so nutrient-dense that nutritionists consider them both a protein and a vegetable. pulses are rich in vitamins and minerals, providing consumers iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc, and are abundant with b vitamins. they contribute to a balanced diet, and have been shown to lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes, lower blood pressure and cholesterol. pulses can also play an important role in mitigating the harmful effects of human exposure to heavy metals, including lead, in communities across the united states. in addition, according to conservative estimates, pulse crops provide thousands of production and manufacturing jobs in rural communities across the country. in the states of washington and idaho alone, 2015 saw over 226 million pounds of dry peas, nearly 70 million pounds of lentils, and over 165 million pounds of chickpeas produced. top chefs and households around the country are discovering these healthy, affordable, sustainable and delicious super foods. to help raise awareness of these crops, the united nations declared 2016 as the international year of pulses. pulses will play a major role in meeting future food needs as the world's growing population, which is set to require a 70 percent increase in agricultural production by 2050, because they are sustainable, nutritious, versatile, and affordable. mr. speaker, i ask that all of our colleagues join me in celebrating 2016 as the international year of the pulses. ____________________",2445

JOHN CONYERS, JR. of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing, together with my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, a resolution calling on the Senate to observe regular order and to give President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court full and fair consideration and an up-or-down vote. Judge Garland is an eminently seasoned jurist who has the qualities to make him an upstanding nominee for the Supreme Court. His unquestioned intellect, long judicial experience, and even temperament are widely admired and respected, even by Republicans like Senator Orrin Hatch, who called him a ``consensus nominee'' for the Supreme Court who would be ``very well supported by all sides.'' Moreover, his deep respect for and fidelity to the Constitution and the law and his sensitivity to the impact of the law on ordinary people make him a good choice to fill the vacancy. Unfortunately, with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, we have seen partisan politics regarding Supreme Court nominations reach a new low. For instance, within hours of Justice Scalia's passing, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said that the Senate would refuse to consider any nomination made by President Obama to fill the vacancy. In addition to being an astounding failure to carry out its constitutional duty, Senate Republicans' flat-out refusal to consider President Obama's nominee, regardless of the nominee's qualifications, is part of a longstanding [[Page E371]] pattern of disrespect shown to this President in particular. The Senate must provide the same consideration and respect for this President and his Supreme Court nominee that every other President has been given. The President, of course, has the Constitutional authority and obligation to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article II, Section 2, and he has fulfilled his duty with his nomination of Judge Garland. And the Senate has both the authority and the obligation to provide advice and consent on the President's nominee pursuant to that same provision. Yet, the Senate has flatly refused to do its job, which is simply unacceptable. It is clear that the Constitution requires that both the President and the Senate fulfill their respective roles in the Supreme Court nomination process in order for the Supreme Court to be able to fully perform its constitutional role. Otherwise, what is to stop the Senate from simply grinding the Court--a co-equal branch of government--to a halt by simply refusing to consider any nominees to fill any vacancies on the Court. There is no merit to the argument that we have to wait until we elect a new President. After all, the American people twice elected President Obama to fulfill the duties of President, including the duty to appoint Supreme Court justices. And there is ample precedent for Presidents nominating, and the Senate confirming, Supreme Court nominees in the last year of a presidency. For example, in 1988, during the last full year of Republican Ronald Reagan's presidency, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed the nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy by President Reagan by a 97-0 vote. Today, there are 10 months left in President Obama's term. This is more than sufficient time for the President to nominate, and for the Senate to consider and vote on his nominee. It is vital that the Supreme Court have a full complement of justices so that the critical constitutional and legal questions before the Court can be given the full attention that they need. While the House of Representatives does not have a formal say in the nomination process, it is important that its voice be heard on this important constitutional matter, and I urge the House to pass my resolution. The Senate should do its job, comply with regular order, hold fair hearings on Judge Garland's nomination, and then hold an up-or-down vote on the nomination. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E370-E371] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE INTRODUCTION OF A HOUSE RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THAT THE SENATE SHOULD PROVIDE FULL AND FAIR CONSIDERATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION OF JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND ______ HON.

HILDA ZIMMERLY ______ HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of florida in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of Women's History month I rise today to honor Mrs. Hilda Zimmerly, an outstanding individual from the state of Florida. Originally from Ohio, Mrs. Zimmerly moved to LaBelle, Florida in 1977 after previously serving as a teacher and a bookkeeper in her home state. While in Ohio, Mrs. Zimmerly paused her college education in order to fill the need for teachers in the region, taking up part time teaching during her third year of college, all while balancing family and her other job as a secretary. Once she moved to LaBelle, she continued to work as a secretary to provide for her family and three young children. Mrs. Zimmerly eventually saved up enough to open up Hilda's Stitchery Shoppe. It was located in the same building as the business she served as a secretary, which enabled her to work both jobs concurrently. While working two jobs and raising a family, she was still able to stay active in the church, singing in the choir, and participating in youth leadership. Although she had a small business, Mrs. Zimmerly had always wanted to go back to teaching. When a job became available in Glades County in the nearby town of Moore Haven, Mrs. Zimmerly moved on to become this school's librarian after earning her degree from the University of South Florida in media specialty. Her goal of teaching full time became a reality when she was hired in 1994 as a 4th grade teacher at LaBelle Elementary, teaching there one year until she transferred to County Oaks Elementary School also in LaBelle. Mrs. Zimmerly retired from County Oaks Elementary after a distinguished fourteen-year career. After her retirement, Hilda enjoyed her time sewing, scrapbooking and reading until she decided to try her hand at politics. She ran for City Commissioner with the help of her thirteen grandchildren, and won. She has served the city for ten years in this role. While serving as City Commissioner she has been involved in tourism development, the citizens traffic safety board and she is an active participant in City Government. She hopes to continue in this role for the foreseeable future. I am privileged to know Mrs. Zimmerly, and admire her commitment to the community through a career of education and dedicated public service. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Mrs. Zimmerly for her continued service to Southwest Florida, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this remarkable individual. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E370] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MRS.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brigadier General Wilma L. Vaught of Pontiac, Michigan. A decorated veteran and pioneer for women, General Vaught served in the United States Air Force for 28 years and played an instrumental role in breaking down barriers for women in the military. General Vaught began her career in 1957 with her commission as a second lieutenant at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Throughout her distinguished career, General Vaught served throughout the United States and abroad in a variety of roles. From 1968 to 1969, she served as a management analyst for Deputy Chief of Staff, Comptroller, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, in Saigon. She continued to excel, and in 1980, was promoted to Brigadier General. She was one of only seven female generals in the entire United States armed forces when she retired in 1985. During her time in the United States Air Force, General Vaught received a number of commendations for her service. Her military decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, and Legion of Merit. In addition to being the first woman promoted to Brigadier General in the comptroller field, General Vaught was the first woman to deploy with an Air Force bomber wing, further breaking down barriers for women serving our country. After her military service, General Vaught fought for recognition of women's contributions to our nation's armed forces. As the leader of the Women in Military Service to America Memorial Foundation, she played a significant role in the creation of this wonderful tribute to women at Arlington National Cemetery. This is the only major memorial that honors America's servicewomen and serves as a testament to their courage and bravery. General Vaught is a true patriot and trail-blazer for women in the military. Her distinguished service and groundbreaking accomplishments are an inspiration to all of us. It is for this reason, Mr. Speaker, that I ask my colleagues today to join me in honoring Brigadier General Wilma L. Vaught for her contributions to our country. I thank her for her leadership and exemplary service to our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E371] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF BRIGADIER GENERAL WILMA VAUGHT ______ HON.

General Vaught began her career in 1957 with her commission as a second lieutenant at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Throughout her distinguished career, General Vaught served throughout the United States and abroad in a variety of roles. From 1968 to 1969, she served as a management analyst for Deputy Chief of Staff, Comptroller, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, in Saigon. She continued to excel, and in 1980, was promoted to Brigadier General. She was one of only seven female generals in the entire United States armed forces when she retired in 1985. During her time in the United States Air Force, General Vaught received a number of commendations for her service. Her military decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, and Legion of Merit. In addition to being the first woman promoted to Brigadier General in the comptroller field, General Vaught was the first woman to deploy with an Air Force bomber wing, further breaking down barriers for women serving our country. After her military service, General Vaught fought for recognition of women's contributions to our nation's armed forces. As the leader of the Women in Military Service to America Memorial Foundation, she played a significant role in the creation of this wonderful tribute to women at Arlington National Cemetery. This is the only major memorial that honors America's servicewomen and serves as a testament to their courage and bravery. General Vaught is a true patriot and trail-blazer for women in the military. Her distinguished service and groundbreaking accomplishments are an inspiration to all of us. It is for this reason, Mr. Speaker, that I ask my colleagues today to join me in honoring Brigadier General Wilma L. Vaught for her contributions to our country. I thank her for her leadership and exemplary service to our country. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E371] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF BRIGADIER GENERAL WILMA VAUGHT ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, in recognition of Women's History Month, I rise today to honor Officer Lourdes Hernandez, an outstanding individual in the South Florida community. Officer Hernandez first joined the Miami-Dade Police Department in 1997. After two years in the force, she decided to take a leave of absence and enlist in the United States Army Reserves. Officer Hernandez served honorably for seven months, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her service. Officer Hernandez returned to the Miami-Dade Police Department as part of the Intracoastal District's Crime Suppression Team, but quickly moved to the Miami-Dade Narcotics Bureau, where she has been for the past thirteen years. Officer Hernandez's most recent accomplishment is the completion of Miami-Dade's Special Response Team (SRT) boot camp training. This five week program is extremely mentally and physically grueling. Officer Hernandez is the only woman to have completed the updated course, which is a testament to her strength and tenacity. It is worth noting that Hernandez's determination to achieve this goal was formed nearly three years ago. Her focus and seriousness of purpose clearly go above and beyond the usual. Officer Hernandez sets a high priority on physical and tactical training. She appreciates the dangers that officers see in the field and remains committed to keeping herself, her fellow officers, and every citizen as safe as possible. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Officer Lourdes Hernandez for her continued service to South Florida, and the world at large, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this remarkable individual.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Richard ``Dick'' Moore on the occasion of his retirement after 31 years of dedicated service with the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. Dick was born in Dearborn, Michigan and graduated from Michigan State University in 1977, which was the same year he married his high school sweetheart and future lawyer, Kathy. After studying law at Stetson University College, he passed the bar in 1980 and began his career as a prosecutor in Naples, Florida. He successfully tried over 50 felony jury trials during his time working there as an Assistant State Attorney. In 1985, Dick interviewed with future Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court Carol Corrigan and was appointed as a Deputy District Attorney for Alameda County. Dick began with the Alameda County District Attorney's office, first rotating through the Berkeley, Oakland, Alameda, and Fremont branches before being assigned to the felony trial team at the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse in January 1988. During the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, Dick began building his legacy by successfully prosecuting serious felony cases against some of Alameda County's most violent offenders in multiple high- profile cases. Based on his accomplishments, in 2000 Alameda County District Attorney Thomas J. Orloff appointed Dick as the Felony Trial Team Leader. For the past 16 years Dick has overseen all felony prosecutions and supervised all felony trial deputies. Under the direction of both then-District Attorney Orloff and current Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley, Dick mentored and trained countless Deputy District Attorneys on the importance of being an ethical prosecutor. In fact, Dick even trained both California Attorney General Kamala Harris and I during our time as prosecutors for the office. Dick has earned the respect of judges, defense attorneys, law enforcement, and victims of crime for his sense of justice and fairness. I want to congratulate him on his long and distinguished career and to wish him health and happiness in retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E372] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING RICHARD ``DICK'' MOORE ON HIS RETIREMENT ______ HON.

JAMES P. McGOVERN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible achievements of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the 2016 recipient of the National Academy of Engineering's prestigious Bernard M. Gordon Prize for Innovation in Engineering and Technology Education. WPI is being recognized this year by the National Academy of Engineering for ``The WPI Plan,'' the university's revolutionary project-based approach to education and for the leadership and contributions of four faculty leaders who continue the development and growth of opportunities offered by the WPI Plan. The Gordon Prize, an annual award recognizing new modalities and experiments in education that develop effective engineering leaders, will be presented to WPI on April 15, 2016, for a ``project-based engineering curriculum developing leadership, innovative problem solving, interdisciplinary collaboration, and global competencies,'' and will be shared by Diran Apelian, Alcoa-Howmet Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Director of WPI's Metal Processing Institute; Arthur Heinricher, Dean of Undergraduate Studies; Richard Vaz, Dean of Interdisciplinary and Global Studies; and Kristin Wobbe, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies. WPI's focus is for students to apply theory to practice to achieve impact upon the great problems of our day. The faculty members who have been singled out for this award are outstanding at driving innovation in the WPI curriculum and inspiring greatness from students at the university and from their colleagues across the campus. Founded in 1865, WPI has been a pioneer in project-based education since 1970 when, building upon its core philosophy of balancing [[Page E373]] theory and practice in education, the university adopted a revolutionary new undergraduate program known as the WPI Plan. The new approach replaced the traditional, rigidly prescribed engineering curriculum with a flexible and academically challenging program aimed at helping students learn by synthesizing classroom experience in projects that involve real world problems. In 1974, WPI launched a global component to its project-based curriculum and now sends approximately 70 percent of its students to more than 45 project centers around the world. At these centers, students work in teams to focus on issues such as energy, food, health, and urban sustainability. The Global Projects Program offers students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in tackling real problems, develop an understanding of other cultures, and see how their lives and work can make a meaningful impact. During my time in Congress, I've had the opportunity to meet with WPI students, faculty, and staff, and continue to be impressed by the incredible research being done at this world-class university based in my hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts. Each year I have the privilege of learning from WPI students who attend the Washington, D.C. project center, and I am confident that they enter the workforce well-prepared to help solve some of our nation's biggest challenges and influence the development of policy to move our country forward. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating WPI and its outstanding faculty members. To be recognized by the National Academy of Engineering and Bernard Gordon is a tremendous honor, and the WPI community should be so proud of this incredible achievement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E372-E373] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE'S LEADERSHIP IN ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION ______ HON.

JUAN LORENZO HINOJOSA AND SOLIDARITY BRIDGE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E372] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DR. JUAN LORENZO HINOJOSA AND SOLIDARITY BRIDGE ______ HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY of illinois in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and congratulate Juan Lorenzo Hinojosa, PhD, for his founding of Solidarity Bridge, the Evanston-based non-profit, now in its 16th year. Through this organization, Dr. Hinojosa has dedicated himself to transforming lives by promoting solidarity and justice, harnessing the good will of generous people in the United States and in Bolivia to heal and empower in a spirit of mutuality and profound respect. I am proud that many who participate in the Solidarity Bridge mission as physicians, nurses, interpreters, chaplains, and helpers are residents of the 9th Congressional District of Illinois. In 1999, Dr. Hinojosa launched the first Solidarity Bridge medical mission trip to Bolivia. Over the next 16 years, guided by his extraordinary vision and leadership, Solidarity Bridge grew far beyond its initial purpose of bringing medical volunteers on short-term mission trips. In close collaboration with medical communities in the U.S. and in South America, and with its sister organization, Puente de Solidaridad, Solidarity Bridge developed four year-round programs in Bolivia to provide high-complexity surgery, as well as a Center for the Development of Neurosurgery. Through those efforts, lifesaving and life-transforming care has been provided for over 60,000 people who otherwise would not have had access to the care they desperately need. Dr. Hinojosa is Bolivian-American and a naturalized citizen of the United States. His memory of the poverty and suffering he witnessed as a child never ceased to pull on his heart. Over many years, his longing to serve the impoverished people of his native land was strengthened by his Catholic faith, with its focus on compassion and justice. Then, in 1999, Dr. Hinojosa met Dr. Enrique ViaReque, also a Bolivian-American living in the Chicago area, and, with his invaluable help, was finally able to fulfill his heart's longing by founding Solidarity Bridge. Dr. Hinojosa and Dr. ViaReque are outstanding examples of the important contributions immigrants make to the social fabric of the United States of America. One of the greatest qualities of our citizens is the responsibility we feel to share our material abundance with those who have less. Dr. Hinojosa nurtured that sense of responsibility in others and created a highly effective means by which the abundant good will and generosity of volunteers, donors, hospitals, and medical supply companies are channeled to serve those who live in poverty. Through Solidarity Bridge, he has promoted and strengthened bonds of solidarity among thousands of people of good will in the United States and in Bolivia. Dr. Hinojosa has created a bridge of solidarity between diverse individuals and communities, a bridge that enriches and heals every person who walks on it, whatever their role may be. I invite my colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. Juan Lorenzo Hinojosa and congratulating him on the fruitful work he has accomplished. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E372] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of fallen New Jersey State Trooper Sean Cullen of Cinnaminson, New Jersey, for his extraordinary sacrifice and exemplary service to the citizens of New Jersey and the United States. Trooper Cullen was born in Dublin, Ireland, and immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child. Trooper Cullen and his family resided in Cinnaminson, New Jersey, and he graduated from Cinnaminson High School in 2003. Trooper Cullen subsequently became a police officer, serving in the Sea Isle City, Mount Holly, and Westampton Township Police Departments. In 2014, he became a trooper with the New Jersey State Police as a graduate of the 154th Class of the New Jersey State Police Academy and was assigned to the Bellmawr Station, Camden County Barracks. On March 8, 2016, Trooper Cullen tragically passed away following a motor vehicle accident that occurred while he was on duty and responding to an incident. Trooper Cullen was a loving and devoted father, son, and brother, whose memory will live on in the hearts of his fiancee, family, friends, and colleagues. He made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the citizens of New Jersey and served with courage, professionalism, and a commitment to the finest ideals and traditions of the New Jersey State Police. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that we mourn the loss of Trooper Sean Cullen, whose life reminds us that the men and women who serve and protect our communities put their lives on the line every day to protect us.

CREC-2016-03-23-pt1-PgE373-2,CREC-2016-03-23,114,IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E373] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE ______ HON. DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of Washtenaw Community College in Ann Arbor Michigan. Washtenaw Community College is a pillar of higher education in Michigan's 12th Congressional District and has helped make an affordable education possible for countless individuals and their families for half a century. Each year, more than 18,000 students register for classes to say nothing of the thousands who take advantage of their Economic and Community Development classes--non-credit courses designed to provide professional development and personal enrichment for citizens throughout Washtenaw County and beyond. Since 1966, this institution has stood as a symbol of hope in our community. It has provided its students, many of whom are immigrants, with the opportunity to quite literally achieve the ``American Dream'' through the education and skills needed to not only enrich themselves, but also to become vital members of our workforce. Diversity is celebrated here with students from over 100 foreign countries comprising its student body. As many of us already know, the effects of globalization have made our local workforce far more competitive. Since its formation, Washtenaw Community College has provided the instruction needed for students to enroll in programs that are important to Michigan's future. In the 1970's, Washtenaw Community College developed programs in manufacturing, automotive service, culinary arts, and business. Today, the school has adapted to the ever-changing demands of the job market by adding computer science, pharmacy tech, robotic and national trade programs. Today, while our lives have become more and more complicated, higher education has become a basic necessity for success. Aside from its affordability and high-quality course offerings, Washtenaw Community College places great emphasis on convenience by offering more than 100 programs and approximately 1500 classes each year--seven days a week, at night and online. In addition to their academic programming, Washtenaw Community College was one of the first colleges to recognize the changing dynamics of our economy by offering daycare services, making education a possibility for many working moms and families. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Washtenaw Community College for its fifty years of leadership in helping shape and prepare the next generation of workers, business people and civic leaders in my district. We thank you for your willingness to think outside the box, for your flexibility and for your vision, and we look forward to another 50 years when we can celebrate your Centennial. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E373] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WASHTENAW COMMUNITY COLLEGE ______ HON.

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Alabama State University Lady Hornets for their outstanding basketball record over the past two seasons. On March 12, the Alabama State University Lady Hornets won their second straight Southwestern Athletic Conference tournament with a 55 to 51 victory over the Southern University Jaguars. This victory made Head Coach Freda Freeman-Jackson the first SWAC coach to lead a team to consecutive tournament titles. The Alabama State University Lady Hornets advanced to the NCAA tournament where they competed against the Texas Lady Longhorns this past Saturday. This was their third all-time NCAA appearance. During the 2015-2016 season, the Alabama State University Lady Hornets won 19 games and for a second straight year, the team was a 15 seed. I would like to particularly congratulate the two Lady Hornets who are from the 7th Congressional District of Alabama, Miss Jasmine Peeples from Selma and Miss Tatyana Calhoun from Montgomery. Tatyana is a junior and was named second team All-State and an MVP in 2013. Jasmine is an all SWAC second-team performer and is a senior. She, along with her teammates, Britney Wright and Daniele Ewert, was voted to the all-SWAC Tournament team this year. As we celebrate Women's History Month, it is important to recognize the female athletes who have made significant contributions to athletic programs across our country. Although it has been almost forty-five years since Title IX was passed here in Congress, female athletes are still not afforded the same respect, resources and attention afforded to male athletes. The success achieved by the Alabama State University Lady Hornets over the past two seasons will be a tremendous recruiting tool for Alabama State University Coach Freeman-Jackson and have undeniably made Alabama State University a stronger institution. I am incredibly proud of the successes the Alabama State University Lady Hornets and their coaches have made over the past two seasons. I look forward to watching this team grow and continue to win titles under the leadership of Coach Freeman-Jackson and Assistant coaches Clayton Harris, Yvette McDaniel, and Michael Floyd. Go Hornets.

NORMA J. TORRES of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Los Angeles Police Department Communication Division for its dedicated service to protecting our communities. Throughout the region, there are several public safety call centers staffed by civilians who dedicate their lives to helping others. These individuals are critical to Los Angeles' public safety and help serve the wide-ranging needs of everyday residents. Though they rarely get the credit they deserve, it is difficult to understate the importance of these professionals in serving our communities. While public-safety communicators are usually the first individuals that the public comes in contact with during an emergency, they also play a vital role in coordinating the first response to police, fire, and rescue incidents. They possess many admirable qualities, among which is the ability to maintain composure under extremely stressful circumstances. As a former 9-1-1 dispatcher within the department, I know the challenges they face on a daily basis, which is why I would like to honor their service to our community. Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to work for the Los Angeles Police Department Communication Division for over 17 years. Throughout that time, this division has helped coordinate responses to both routine occurrences and extraordinary situations, some of which have garnered national and international attention. They regularly dispatch first responders to thousands of incidents and have played a critical role in national emergencies. I applaud their continual efforts to serve our communities. On Sunday, April 10, they will be hosting an alumni gathering to mark the start of National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week. Mr. Speaker, they are just one of many community organizations across the country that will recognize the second week of April as National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week. I would like to offer my support for this declaration and make note that I have introduced a Concurrent Resolution that would offer Congress' recognition of this designation. I believe that this will highlight the important contributions that public safety communication professionals provide our communities day in and day out and recognize the value of their work. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E374] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT COMMUNICATION DIVISION ______ HON.

JOHN R. CARTER of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the service of an esteemed and valued citizen of the Killeen, TX and Fort Hood area. Connie Kuehl has dedicated herself to Central Texas for nearly 30 years, diligently overseeing and directing countless organizations and community projects. Connie's immeasurable service and innovative vision for her community are qualities of an ideal citizen. Graduating from the University of Texas in 1973, Connie earned her degree in Education and Science. Pursuing her passion for SCUBA diving, she obtained an instructor license in 1979 and taught lessons for ten years. This was only the beginning of Connie's lifetime of sharing her time and talents with others. In 1990, she became Temple's first Tourism Director and worked tirelessly to promote the community through her service on multiple boards and organizations.

She has also served as President for Altrusa of Central Texas as well as the Texas Association of Convention and Visitors Bureaus, where she earned the Texas Destination Marketing Certification. No matter where or how Connie serves, she exceeds the highest of expectations. Her desire to constantly improve and challenge her [[Page E375]] community has enabled the Fort Hood area to become involved in a wide range of activities and programs. Connie has helped promote creativity and the arts by developing the ``Take 190 West'' arts festival, a highlight of the Killeen cultural calendar. Connie's talents aren't limited to her extraordinary work ethic and commitment to service. She won 1st Place in District Nine for the Share Your Story, Share Your Dream writing contest and 2nd Place internationally. Like all of us in Central Texas, Connie was deeply affected by the 2009 terror attack on Fort Hood. Knowing this tragedy was one we can never forget, Connie selflessly contributed her efforts and hard work into organizing the Fort Hood Memorial Dedication fundraising and ceremony. This poignant and moving memorial honors the lives of those lost that dark day and reminds all who visit of the sacrifices made in the name of freedom. Connie considers this project to be the highlight of her long career. Connie's invaluable service and capacity to take on multiple leadership roles has left a positive and lasting impact on both her community and those she has come in contact with. Citizens like Connie Kuehl are greatly valued, and she will be missed upon her retirement. She looks forward to spending time with her two sons, Shawn and Chad Bowman, granddaughter Emily, and new grandbaby on the way. I know Connie's family is very proud of her career and achievements and I wish her much joy and happiness in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E374-E375] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CONNIE KUEHL ______ HON.

GWEN MOORE of wisconsin in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great woman, Tamara Grigsby. She was a social worker, family counselor, instructor, state legislator, administrator and advocate for children, women and social justice. Ms. Tamara Grigsby passed away on March 14, 2016. Tamara Grigsby was born in Pullman, Washington and graduated from Memorial High School in Madison. She received an undergraduate degree from Howard University and Master's Degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am honored to pay tribute to Tamara Grigsby, she was a leader extraordinaire. She taught at Carroll and Cardinal Stritch Universities, as well as UW-Milwaukee. Tamara served as program manager at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families prior to running and winning a seat as one of my successors to serve as representative for Wisconsin's 18th Assembly District. In fact, I encouraged Tamara to run for this seat. After her retirement from the state legislature, she worked for both the Milwaukee Public Schools and Madison Public Schools. At the time of her death, she was the Director of Dane County's Department of Equity and Inclusion. As a legislator from 2005 to 2013, Tamara proved prolific. She both introduced and passed a large number of meaningful legislation to secure equality, fairness, and opportunity for Wisconsin's citizens. In fact in 2010, she was 18 for 18, passing 18 bills the same number as the legislative seat that she held. She also served admirably as a member of the prestigious Legislature's Joint Finance Committee. When she endured a life-threatening health battle in 2011, she fought back with the same vigor as she had exhibited on behalf of her constituents. Tamara Grigsby received many awards including the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin most prestigious recognition, the Rebecca C. Young Legislative Leadership Award and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Emerging Leader Award. Further she was named as one of the The 30 Most Influential Social Workers Alive Today in 2014 by the Social Work Degree Guide. I am proud to have called Tamara Grigsby my friend; she made a positive impact on all of Wisconsin. She leaves behind many friends, former staffers, admirers and family members to mourn her passing including her dear parents: Dr. E. Howard Grigsby and Bettye Grigsby. I was captivated by her passion and commitment to improving the lives of Wisconsinites. She was a fierce opponent of policies aimed at hurting public schools, health care and stronger communities. She fought to address racial and ethnic disparities in our criminal justice system, and advancing equality of rights for all. Mr. Speaker for these reasons I rise to pay tribute to an amazing woman, Tamara Grigsby. While her time with us was a short 41 years, she leaves behind an enduring legacy for future leaders to follow. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E375] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO TAMARA GRIGSBY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my Maryland colleagues in paying tribute to the life and memory of Officer First Class Jacai David Colson, who fell in the line of duty on Sunday. Officer Colson was twenty-eight years old and had served with the Prince George's County Police Department for four years. He lost his life responding courageously to an attack by a gunman on the District Three police station in Landover, Maryland. He did what he and his brothers and sisters in law enforcement have been trained to do: run toward gunfire in an attempt to save lives and protect bystanders and their fellow officers. Officer Colson is a hero, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his fellow officers. His father, James Colson, called his son `courageous' and `an excellent role model.' Officer Colson's high school football coach cited his extraordinary character and how he `treated everyone with respect.' Originally from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Officer Colson followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, who served on the Upper Chichester Township police force in Delaware County for more than four decades. Prince George's County was fortunate to have Officer Colson on the force, and he left a lasting impression on so many people both here in Maryland and back home in Pennsylvania. I join with my Maryland colleagues in mourning this tragic loss and honoring Officer Jacai Colson for his service to our Prince George's County communities, to the State of Maryland, and to our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E375] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO OFFICER FIRST CLASS JACAI DAVID COLSON ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my Maryland colleagues in paying tribute to the life and memory of Officer First Class Jacai David Colson, who fell in the line of duty on Sunday. Officer Colson was twenty-eight years old and had served with the Prince George's County Police Department for four years. He lost his life responding courageously to an attack by a gunman on the District Three police station in Landover, Maryland. He did what he and his brothers and sisters in law enforcement have been trained to do: run toward gunfire in an attempt to save lives and protect bystanders and their fellow officers. Officer Colson is a hero, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his fellow officers. His father, James Colson, called his son `courageous' and `an excellent role model.' Officer Colson's high school football coach cited his extraordinary character and how he `treated everyone with respect.'

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of Our Savior Parish. It is my honor and privilege to recognize the devotion and hard work of the members of Our Savior Parish, who for so long now have striven to support the communities of Detroit and Dearborn Heights. Following the separation of the Roman Catholic Church and Polish National Catholic Church in 1897, Polish Americans throughout the country struggled to find a medium to express their religious beliefs. Independent churches soon formed throughout the country to meet the needs of the Polish community. Our Savior Parish was founded in 1916 in the City of Detroit, the first independent Polish Catholic Church in Michigan. Initially, the group focused on helping Polish immigrants better acclimate to life in America. The parish established a bilingual accredited parochial school, and enrollment reached over 350 students. By 1970, increasing membership resulted in the parish relocating to a new, beautiful church complex in Dearborn Heights. The members of Our Savior Parish continue to give back to our community. The church performs an annual Thanksgiving canned-food drive, as well as an annual Christmas coat drive. Additionally, each Christmas the church hosts an ``Adopt-a-family'' program with the local school district.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of Our Savior Parish. It is my honor and privilege to recognize the devotion and hard work of the members of Our Savior Parish, who for so long now have striven to support the communities of Detroit and Dearborn Heights. Following the separation of the Roman Catholic Church and Polish National Catholic Church in 1897, Polish Americans throughout the country struggled to find a medium to express their religious beliefs. Independent churches soon formed throughout the country to meet the needs of the Polish community. Our Savior Parish was founded in 1916 in the City of Detroit, the first independent Polish Catholic Church in Michigan. Initially, the group focused on helping Polish immigrants better acclimate to life in America. The parish established a bilingual accredited parochial school, and enrollment reached over 350 students. By 1970, increasing membership resulted in the parish relocating to a new, beautiful church complex in Dearborn Heights. The members of Our Savior Parish continue to give back to our community. The church performs an annual Thanksgiving canned-food drive, as well as an annual Christmas coat drive. Additionally, each Christmas the church hosts an ``Adopt-a-family'' program with the local school district. This program provides food, gifts, and most importantly, a warm Christmas spirit to those families in the community stricken by hard times. Their community work continues throughout the year.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my sincere condolences and to honor the extraordinary life of Robert A. Lucas, owner of the famous Donkey's Place in Camden, New Jersey. Born in Camden, raised in Medford, and a graduate of Rancocas Valley Regional High School, Robert was truly a son of New Jersey. By the 1970s, he started running Donkey's Place, a bar opened in 1943 by his father, Leon, a former Olympic boxer. Donkey's still has a simple menu, consisting of cheesesteaks served on a poppy seed Kaiser roll from Del Buono's in Haddon Heights and a no-frills bar, just the way Robert liked it. Donkey's is an institution in South Jersey, serving everyone from factory workers in its early days, to neighborhood residents, police officers, and city workers. Highlighted on the CNN television show Parts Unknown, chef and world traveler Anthony Bourdain said of Donkey's, ``the best cheesesteaks in the area might well come from New Jersey'' and it deserves to be a ``national landmark.'' A devoted family man, Robert even met his future wife of 39 years, Elsie, at Donkey's. It was love at first sight and Elsie remembers dreaming about her future husband that very night. Robert and Elsie had 4 children, Robert, Jr., Joseph, Lisa Bystryzycki, and Luis Mendoza, and 2 grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, Robert A. Lucas was an incredible man, dedicated to his family, the South Jersey community, and his business. He leaves behind an indomitable work ethic and one of the finest establishments in Camden.

MARC A. VEASEY of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 40th Anniversary of The Latin Express Band. The Latin Express Band has serenaded Dallas- Fort Worth residents for four decades and counting and given back to the community in a variety of ways. Mr. Carlos Saenz, a graduate of Fort Worth's North Side High School, founded The Latin Express Band in 1976 after fundraising for a school trip. After receiving support and recognition from his classmates, Mr. Saenz added his younger brother, Leo Saenz, to join as drummer and vocalist. Since their formation, the Latin Express Band has played at music venues throughout the DFW Metroplex and the United States, even playing in the nation's capital. In January 2001, they were invited to perform during the Presidential Inaugural Ball for President George W. Bush. The Latin Express Band has received several accolades for their musical contributions throughout the years. Dating back to 1998, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram presented the band with its first award, the ``Best Tejano Band.'' They would go on to receive additional awards from Fort Worth Weekly, Hispanic Council of Tarrant County, and the Dallas Morning News. The Latin Express Band was inducted into the Tejano Roots Hall of Fame in 2008. Additionally, the Latin Express Band supports various charitable groups and makes significant contributions to local organizations such as the Tarrant Area Food Bank. The Latin Express Band has inspired future generations of local musicians by supporting music education for children, youth and adults throughout the Metroplex. On March 31, 2016, the band will perform for the first time at Fort Worth's historic Casa Manana Theatre. Proceeds from the concert will support music education programs in the Fort Worth Independent School District. The concert takes place on the birthday of the legendary Latino civil rights leader, Cesar Chavez. The band will play in honor of Chavez, an activist who continuously fought to gain equal rights for all minorities. The Saenz brothers are a staple in the Fort Worth community, both through sharing their musical talents and service to the Metroplex. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LATIN EXPRESS BAND ______ HON.

MOUNGER OF JACKSON ______ HON. TRENT KELLY of mississippi in the house of representatives Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on March 31, 1926, William ``Billy'' Mounger was born in Jackson, Mississippi. Mr. Mounger graduated from Central High School in Jackson and attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He intended on playing football at West Point, as one of the 27 players around the country recruited by the school, but failed to make the team. Instead of giving up and going back home, he graduated in 1948 with a degree in General Engineering and served five years in the U.S. Air Force. While in the Air Force, he attained the rank of First Lieutenant and served as an Aircraft Commander of the B-50 Medium Bomber as well as Atomic Bomb Commander. Mr. Mounger continued his education at the University of Oklahoma, receiving a bachelor's degree and master's degree in Petroleum Engineering. He has had a long and successful career in oil production. In addition to his business success, many people know Mr. Mounger for his work in establishing and developing the Republican Party in the South and especially Mississippi. His leadership roles are extensive, but to name a few: he has served on the Mississippi State Republican Executive Committee for decades, as the Mississippi Republican Finance Chairman, and on the Republican National Finance Committee. It is a direct result of Mr. Mounger's work and dedication to the party that Mississippi is now a Republican stronghold. Most importantly, Mr. Mounger is a proud husband, father, and grandfather. He is also a man of faith, as a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Jackson. On his 90th birthday, I thank him for his contributions to Mississippi and the Republican Party. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 46 (Wednesday, March 23, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE BIRTHDAY OF WILLIAM D.

She also worked with the PACE Center for Girls, an organization that works to keep at-risk girls in a safe and productive environment that fosters their growth. Ms. Gomez also founded Lolita's Hispanic Family Center, which is a family resource center that promotes, implements, and advocates for bilingual, culturally competent evidence-based programs to enhance the quality of life of Hispanic and other minorities in Southwest Florida. In addition, she is also a board member of the Immokalee Housing and Family Services, a facilitator of the Immokalee Interagency Council, and an organizer of Hispanic Women in Healthcare of Collier County. In each of her positions, Aracely Gomez has demonstrated compassionate care. She is passionate about improving access to behavioral services, especially for minorities. She has worked for established institutions and created new ones where she sees a need. I am privileged to know Ms. Gomez, and admire her commitment to the community.
