Mr. President, we will soon begin consideration of bipartisan legislation that can support American jobs, improve airline safety, and help passengers--all without raising taxes or fees on travelers. The FAA Reauthorization Act before us is the result of a collaborative committee process. It shows what is possible with a Senate that is back to work and back to regular order. In this case, the Commerce Committee held a series of seven hearings to guide and inform its deliberations throughout this process. Republicans on the Commerce Committee had their say, Democrats on the Commerce Committee offered their input, and at the end of the day, Members of both parties were able to agree on bipartisan legislation that passed committee on a voice vote. We know the bipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act will promote American manufacturing, preserve rural access in States such as Kentucky, and advance new consumer protections for the flying public. We also know it will help improve safety and security both in the skies and in our airports. Here are a few ways this bipartisan bill can help: by allowing us to better prepare for the outbreak of communicable diseases like Ebola, by improving the quality of FAA's safety workforce, by encouraging the FAA to harmonize international safety standards, by bringing the government and stakeholders together in the development of safety standards for unmanned aerial vehicles, and by taking aim at human trafficking. This legislation is the product of a lot of hard work and reaching across the aisle. At this time I wish to recognize Senator Thune for leading the effort. He knows what is possible in a Senate that is back to work for the American people. He worked hard with the top Democrat on his committee, Senator Nelson, to get us to this point today. But these two Senators certainly didn't do it all by themselves. Senator Ayotte was one of the key players in this bipartisan effort. As chair of the Subcommittee on Aviation, Senator Ayotte held numerous briefings and hearings on the issue with her colleague Senator Cantwell. While many in this Chamber are focusing on the issue now, the bill before us is the product of many months of work by members of the Commerce Committee and their staff. Let's continue to work together in a similar spirit. While the Commerce Committee has produced a product that merits this Chamber's consideration, I am sure they would acknowledge that they don't have a monopoly on good ideas. I hope we can have an efficient amendment process where Members bring their best ideas to the floor. Let's pass another significant piece of legislation for the American people. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1645] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. McCONNELL.

Apparently that wasn't enough to stop him from pursuing the kind of partisan overreach he once described as ``ignoring the law'' and ``unwise and unfair.'' It didn't keep him from doing that anyway. Maybe he didn't anticipate that a Federal district court would issue a preliminary injunction to prevent him from moving forward. Maybe he didn't expect that a Federal appeals court would uphold that ruling. But now the Supreme Court will hear arguments in this case later this month on core constitutional principles like the separation of powers and the duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. That is why I led a group of 43 Republican Senators yesterday in filing an amicus brief in support of the challenge to this overreach--a challenge brought by a majority of America's Governors and attorneys general from across our country. As we highlighted in the brief, the administration's Executive action ``stands in stark contravention to Federal law and to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.'' It is also an ``explicit effort to circumvent the legislative process.'' So, look, whether Republicans or Democrats, this kind of partisan overreach should worry all of us no matter who is in the White House because not only is the President's blatant refusal to follow the law an extraordinary power grab, it is a direct challenge to Congress's constitutional authority and a direct attack on our constitutional order. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1645-S1646] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IMMIGRATION Mr. McCONNELL.

Among many other things, that means we must return to capturing, interrogating, and targeting the enemy in a way that allows us to defeat terrorist networks because let's remember that during his first week in office, the President issued a series of Executive orders that collectively undermined the capability of our intelligence community and military to combat terrorism. Yesterday the Defense Department confirmed that two of Al Qaeda's former explosives experts were transferred from the secure detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to Senegal. Both detainees had long records of supporting Al Qaeda. According to records that have been made public, one of those detainees, a former associate of Osama bin Laden, is likely to reengage in hostilities. The other detainee was previously assessed as likely to return to the fight. This comes at a time when Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has exploited the war in Yemen to secure a safe haven and the al-Nusra Front within Syria is exploiting the civil war there to carry on Al Qaeda's mission. This is precisely the wrong time to send experienced, hardened fighters back into the conflict. We must use the remaining months of the Obama administration as a year of transition to better posture our military to meet the threats we face, not make it more challenging for the next President, regardless of political party. Actually, there have been encouraging changes within the administration recently, such as programs presented in the budget request by the Secretary of Defense to address Chinese and Russian aggression, a public recognition by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of the threat posed by ISIL in Libya, more focus on the need to rebuild a nuclear triad, General Campbell's statement that a larger force must be left in Afghanistan, and the deployment of the expeditionary targeting force to Iraq. This is the wrong time for the administration to release terrorists who are likely to return to the fight. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1646] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WAR ON TERROR Mr. McCONNELL.

CREC-2016-04-05-pt1-PgS1646-5,CREC-2016-04-05,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1646-S1648] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Iowa, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, came to the floor yesterday afternoon in an attempt to divert attention away from that committee and his failure to do his job. He is not doing his job as chairman of that committee. He hoped to do that by focusing on me for objecting to a bill that would expand the subpoena powers of certain government appointees called inspectors general, but his efforts failed. People weren't looking at me; they were looking at the work not done by the Judiciary Committee. I objected to that bill because that legislation was really a legislative overreach, just as my friend the senior Senator from Iowa continues his overreach by turning the Senate Judiciary Committee into, for example, a Benghazi committee--a narrowly partisan committee masquerading as an independent party. It is the same theory that had Secretary Clinton spending 11 or 12 hours before the committee during the course of 1 day. That hearing was a flop because of her assertiveness, her direct answering of questions, and her physical and emotional strength, standing and sitting during that time. My friend's tenure as Judiciary Committee chair has been reduced to one stunt after another. One of his stunts included demanding maternity leave records of one of Secretary Clinton's staffers. Another political stunt was blocking the confirmation of State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan, [[Page S1647]] and yet another political stunt was blocking the promotions list of career Foreign Service officers. And his latest political stunt is preventing the Senate from doing its constitutional duty in considering President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. So even though the senior Senator from Iowa hopes to divert attention away from this disappointment, that is his Republican Judiciary Committee, the people aren't easily fooled. The people of Iowa and the rest of the country certainly aren't buying Senator Grassley's political charades. This morning the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in Iowa, published another scathing editorial regarding Senator Grassley's unprecedented obstruction of the Supreme Court nominee. The editorial highlights the fact that because of the Supreme Court vacancy, the highest Court in the land is now stuck in a rut of 4-to-4 decisions--a stalemate. This is what the Des Moines Register editorial said, and I quote: Americans might need to get used to deadlocks, thanks to Senator Chuck Grassley. The head of the Senate Judiciary Committee seems just fine with stalemate. Now the senior Senator from Iowa may be content with gridlock in the Supreme Court, but the American people simply aren't. They are not content with the way the chairman continues to use one of the most prestigious, independent, and powerful committees to carry out political warfare. So maybe he should spend less time complaining about me and more time simply doing his job. Every day, more and more Senators are meeting with President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Chief Judge Merrick Garland, as well they should. According to the senior Senator from Utah, ``fulfilling that role [of advice and consent] requires us to evaluate a nominee's qualifications for the particular position for which she has been nominated.'' We know that was when they were looking at Sotomayor and Kagan, who are on the Court. That is why every Senator, using the same logic as my friend from Utah--Republican, Democratic--should meet with Judge Garland. This week he has a full slate of meetings scheduled with Senate Democrats. By the end of the week, every Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee will have met with President Obama's nominee. To date, 16 Republicans have either met with Judge Garland or indicated they are willing to do so in the future. Some even have meetings scheduled: Senators Ayotte, Boozman, Cassidy, Cochran, Collins, Flake, Grassley, Inhofe, Johnson, Kirk, Lankford, Murkowski, Portman, Risch, Rounds, and Toomey. These are all Republican Senators who have said publically that they are going to meet with him. I think that is a step in the right direction, and I think it really speaks volumes. Take for example Senator Inhofe and Senator Lankford. I am sure they have in their mind the outstanding work that Garland did when he was U.S. assistant attorney. He led the charge. No one questions his terrific, outstanding prosecution of that man who killed who knows how many people in Oklahoma with that bomb, for which, of course, eventually, he was given the death penalty. This is a good man. Judge Garland is a good man. In every court he goes to, Democrats and Republicans speak highly of him--Chief Justice Roberts, among others. So I was disappointed last week when some Republican Senators, such as Murkowski and Moran, abandoned their previous support for agreeing to consider Judge Garland's nomination. Senator Moran's backtracking is especially alarming because it appears to be the result of a multimillion dollar campaign urging the Senator to reverse his support for a hearing for Judge Garland. As has been reported by the Topeka Capital-Journal, Senator Moran's about-face came in response to a backlash from the Koch brothers. I quote directly from the article: On March 21, Moran told a small crowd in Cimarron, ``I have my job to do,'' and ``I think the process ought to go forward.'' Though he made it clear that Garland likely wouldn't be worthy of his vote, the comments indicated hearings should be held for the judge. But they went on to say more. Within a few days, Moran's comments sparked backlash from conservative groups. The Judicial Crisis Network announced it was putting the finishing touches on an advertising campaign bashing Moran, and the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund said it was considering backing a primary challenger. U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, a fellow Kansas Republican, publicly called on Moran to reconsider, a rare criticism of Moran from a fellow member of the Kansas congressional delegation. The criticisms eventually reached bizarre heights when the Traditional Values Coalition compared Moran to Judas Iscariot. [The] chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network said Friday she was pleased to see Moran changed his mind. Well, I guess you could say he changed his mind. Moran was meeting with Garland and holding confirmation hearings until the Judicial Crisis Network and the tea party and the Koch brothers threatened him. It will surprise no one to learn that the Koch brothers and their dark money helped fund these radical organizations more than anybody else in the world. The Kochs are notorious for bullying anyone who stands in their way. There is, without any question, oligarchs in the land, the first ones I have known in America. They are the Koch brothers. If they are successful in the splurging of their vast wealth and accomplishing what they set out doing in this campaign, I feel very, very bad for our country. They will be talking about us the way they talk about Russia-- the oligarchy that is there. We are going to have one and the same. Now, we must not forget how the Koch brothers' minions tried to intimidate investigative journalist Jane Mayer because she dared to expose the Kochs' attempt to buy our democracy. Her book, called ``Dark Money,'' is on the New York Times bestseller list, and all over the country people are buying that book. Why? Because it is an insight into two brothers who are trying to buy America. Charles and David Koch used their fortune and their tremendous clout to force Senator Moran to back down from his position. Publically, I can't imagine how one of us, a Senator, could be forced to do that in the manner that he was. All of this is because the junior Senator from Kansas dared to meet with the Supreme Court nominee. He dared to suggest that Garland deserved a hearing. He dared to do his job. So is this now what the Republican Party has become--a party dictated by menace and intimidation? All you have to do is look at what is going on with the Republican Presidential nomination. That answers the question itself. Some 30 years ago, though, Senator Grassley said the Judiciary Committee ``has the obligation to build a record and to conduct the most in-depth inquiry that we can'' on Supreme Court nominees. Now the Republican leader, Charles Grassley, have twisted the arms of the Republican Judiciary Committee members, compelling them to sign a loyalty pledge and forcing them to refuse to consider the President's Supreme Court nominee. Regrettably, Senator Moran is just the latest Republican Senator who has allowed himself to be pushed around, to be intimidated by money. Instead of caving to the Republican leader and the Koch brothers, it is time for the Republican Senators to take a stand and do their job. I hope the remaining Republican Senators who said they will meet with him will go ahead and do so and will stand firm. I hope they will meet with Judge Garland and take the next step in the process--to hold confirmation hearings. As it was reported by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the average wait for the Supreme Court nominees, from nomination to hearing, has been 42 days. According to that timeline, Chairman Grassley and his committee should begin confirmation hearings for Judge Garland April 27. Last week, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Republican leader and Chairman Grassley calling on them to abide by this traditional timeline and hold a hearing by the 27th. I am very proud of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee for doing this. That is what the American people want. They want Republicans to stop counting on the most extreme forces within their party and just do their job. That is all we are asking--as simple as that. Mr. President, will the Chair announce what the Senate is scheduled to do the rest of the day.

I quote directly from the article: On March 21, Moran told a small crowd in Cimarron, ``I have my job to do,'' and ``I think the process ought to go forward.'' Though he made it clear that Garland likely wouldn't be worthy of his vote, the comments indicated hearings should be held for the judge. But they went on to say more. Within a few days, Moran's comments sparked backlash from conservative groups. The Judicial Crisis Network announced it was putting the finishing touches on an advertising campaign bashing Moran, and the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund said it was considering backing a primary challenger. U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, a fellow Kansas Republican, publicly called on Moran to reconsider, a rare criticism of Moran from a fellow member of the Kansas congressional delegation. The criticisms eventually reached bizarre heights when the Traditional Values Coalition compared Moran to Judas Iscariot. [The] chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network said Friday she was pleased to see Moran changed his mind. Well, I guess you could say he changed his mind. Moran was meeting with Garland and holding confirmation hearings until the Judicial Crisis Network and the tea party and the Koch brothers threatened him. It will surprise no one to learn that the Koch brothers and their dark money helped fund these radical organizations more than anybody else in the world. The Kochs are notorious for bullying anyone who stands in their way. There is, without any question, oligarchs in the land, the first ones I have known in America. They are the Koch brothers. If they are successful in the splurging of their vast wealth and accomplishing what they set out doing in this campaign, I feel very, very bad for our country. They will be talking about us the way they talk about Russia-- the oligarchy that is there. We are going to have one and the same. Now, we must not forget how the Koch brothers' minions tried to intimidate investigative journalist Jane Mayer because she dared to expose the Kochs' attempt to buy our democracy. Her book, called ``Dark Money,'' is on the New York Times bestseller list, and all over the country people are buying that book. Why? Because it is an insight into two brothers who are trying to buy America. Charles and David Koch used their fortune and their tremendous clout to force Senator Moran to back down from his position. Publically, I can't imagine how one of us, a Senator, could be forced to do that in the manner that he was. All of this is because the junior Senator from Kansas dared to meet with the Supreme Court nominee. He dared to suggest that Garland deserved a hearing. He dared to do his job. So is this now what the Republican Party has become--a party dictated by menace and intimidation? All you have to do is look at what is going on with the Republican Presidential nomination. That answers the question itself. Some 30 years ago, though, Senator Grassley said the Judiciary Committee ``has the obligation to build a record and to conduct the most in-depth inquiry that we can'' on Supreme Court nominees. Now the Republican leader, Charles Grassley, have twisted the arms of the Republican Judiciary Committee members, compelling them to sign a loyalty pledge and forcing them to refuse to consider the President's Supreme Court nominee. Regrettably, Senator Moran is just the latest Republican Senator who has allowed himself to be pushed around, to be intimidated by money. Instead of caving to the Republican leader and the Koch brothers, it is time for the Republican Senators to take a stand and do their job. I hope the remaining Republican Senators who said they will meet with him will go ahead and do so and will stand firm. I hope they will meet with Judge Garland and take the next step in the process--to hold confirmation hearings. As it was reported by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the average wait for the Supreme Court nominees, from nomination to hearing, has been 42 days. According to that timeline, Chairman Grassley and his committee should begin confirmation hearings for Judge Garland April 27. Last week, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Republican leader and Chairman Grassley calling on them to abide by this traditional timeline and hold a hearing by the 27th. I am very proud of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee for doing this. That is what the American people want. They want Republicans to stop counting on the most extreme forces within their party and just do their job. That is all we are asking--as simple as that. Mr. President, will the Chair announce what the Senate is scheduled to do the rest of the day.

record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] filling the supreme court vacancy mr. reid. mr. president, the senior senator from iowa, who is chairman of the judiciary committee, came to the floor yesterday afternoon in an attempt to divert attention away from that committee and his failure to do his job. he is not doing his job as chairman of that committee. he hoped to do that by focusing on me for objecting to a bill that would expand the subpoena powers of certain government appointees called inspectors general, but his efforts failed. people weren't looking at me; they were looking at the work not done by the judiciary committee. i objected to that bill because that legislation was really a legislative overreach, just as my friend the senior senator from iowa continues his overreach by turning the senate judiciary committee into, for example, a benghazi committee--a narrowly partisan committee masquerading as an independent party. it is the same theory that had secretary clinton spending 11 or 12 hours before the committee during the course of 1 day. that hearing was a flop because of her assertiveness, her direct answering of questions, and her physical and emotional strength, standing and sitting during that time. my friend's tenure as judiciary committee chair has been reduced to one stunt after another. one of his stunts included demanding maternity leave records of one of secretary clinton's staffers. another political stunt was blocking the confirmation of state department legal adviser brian egan, [[page s1647]] and yet another political stunt was blocking the promotions list of career foreign service officers. and his latest political stunt is preventing the senate from doing its constitutional duty in considering president obama's supreme court nominee, merrick garland. so even though the senior senator from iowa hopes to divert attention away from this disappointment, that is his republican judiciary committee, the people aren't easily fooled. the people of iowa and the rest of the country certainly aren't buying senator grassley's political charades. this morning the des moines register, the largest newspaper in iowa, published another scathing editorial regarding senator grassley's unprecedented obstruction of the supreme court nominee. the editorial highlights the fact that because of the supreme court vacancy, the highest court in the land is now stuck in a rut of 4-to-4 decisions--a stalemate. this is what the des moines register editorial said, and i quote: americans might need to get used to deadlocks, thanks to senator chuck grassley. the head of the senate judiciary committee seems just fine with stalemate. now the senior senator from iowa may be content with gridlock in the supreme court, but the american people simply aren't. they are not content with the way the chairman continues to use one of the most prestigious, independent, and powerful committees to carry out political warfare. so maybe he should spend less time complaining about me and more time simply doing his job. every day, more and more senators are meeting with president obama's supreme court nominee, chief judge merrick garland, as well they should. according to the senior senator from utah, ``fulfilling that role [of advice and consent] requires us to evaluate a nominee's qualifications for the particular position for which she has been nominated.'' we know that was when they were looking at sotomayor and kagan, who are on the court. that is why every senator, using the same logic as my friend from utah--republican, democratic--should meet with judge garland. this week he has a full slate of meetings scheduled with senate democrats. by the end of the week, every democratic member of the judiciary committee will have met with president obama's nominee. to date, 16 republicans have either met with judge garland or indicated they are willing to do so in the future. some even have meetings scheduled: senators ayotte, boozman, cassidy, cochran, collins, flake, grassley, inhofe, johnson, kirk, lankford, murkowski, portman, risch, rounds, and toomey. these are all republican senators who have said publically that they are going to meet with him. i think that is a step in the right direction, and i think it really speaks volumes. take for example senator inhofe and senator lankford. i am sure they have in their mind the outstanding work that garland did when he was u.s. assistant attorney. he led the charge. no one questions his terrific, outstanding prosecution of that man who killed who knows how many people in oklahoma with that bomb, for which, of course, eventually, he was given the death penalty. this is a good man. judge garland is a good man. in every court he goes to, democrats and republicans speak highly of him--chief justice roberts, among others. so i was disappointed last week when some republican senators, such as murkowski and moran, abandoned their previous support for agreeing to consider judge garland's nomination. senator moran's backtracking is especially alarming because it appears to be the result of a multimillion dollar campaign urging the senator to reverse his support for a hearing for judge garland. as has been reported by the topeka capital-journal, senator moran's about-face came in response to a backlash from the koch brothers. i quote directly from the article: on march 21, moran told a small crowd in cimarron, ``i have my job to do,'' and ``i think

Mr. President, I wish to follow up on a couple of statements that were made by my friend the Republican leader. Senator McConnell mentioned immigration. In the last Congress we worked very hard together in a bipartisan fashion to form a good, comprehensive immigration reform bill. We passed it, but due to the power of the tea partiers--or, as Speaker Boehner referred to them, ``the crazies''-- they didn't have a vote in the House. If they had voted on that legislation, it would have passed. Democrats would have voted for it, and there were enough Republicans who would have voted for it. That would have been a big vote out of there, but it didn't happen, so the President had to do something on immigration, and he laid the groundwork. He spoke at the State of the Union Address and basically said: Since you are not passing any legislation, I will have to use my Executive power in order to get things done. He then proceeded to prioritize what he wanted to do. He issued the order that was so important to boys and girls, called a deferred action, which allowed DREAMers to stay in the country, and that was the right thing to do. He also prioritized deportations by going after criminals, not families, and enforcing the law. He has done a very good job. I think it is also very important to note that the administrative actions the President has taken are nothing unique. We can go back to the days of Theodore Roosevelt, a good Republican President who did a lot of stuff administratively. On his remarks about getting involved in the fight again--I am paraphrasing what he said--that we have to get back to the interrogation we did before, we know that torture was quickly eliminated. That effort was led by a lot of people, not the least of whom was someone who has been tortured, a Member of the U.S. Senate, John McCain. He has spoken out very admirably, and as only he can, about how bad torture is. And the facts indicate that torture doesn't get any new information anyway; there are other ways to get that information. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1646] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IMMIGRATION AND INTERROGATION OF GITMO DETAINEES Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 636, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 55, H.R. 636, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is an old verse that reads, if I remember correctly, as follows: While I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish that man would go away. That man in the U.S. Senate is Merrick Garland, a person whom I am sure the Republican leadership wishes would just go away. But he is not going to go away. Merrick Garland is the nominee whom President Obama has sent forward to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court occasioned by the untimely death of Antonin Scalia. In sending that name forward, President Obama was meeting his constitutional responsibility. Article II, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution states clearly that the President shall--shall-- nominate a person to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. It goes on to say that the responsibility of the Senate is to provide advice and consent to Supreme Court nominations. It is very clear. The men who wrote the Constitution understood the importance of filling a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, and they understood it to be so important that they mandated that the President send the nominee forward to fill that vacancy. You can read that Constitution from start to finish and never find the rationale being used by Senator McConnell, the majority leader of the Senate, to stop that nomination from being considered in the Senate. There is no argument made in the Constitution--nor has there ever been an argument made--that because the President is in the last year of his 4-year term, he no longer has a constitutional responsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. In fact, never-- underline never--has the Senate refused a hearing to a nominee who has been sent forward by a President of the United States to fill this important vacancy. It speaks volumes that Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, has decided--has taken it on himself--to stop the Senate from considering the President's nominee. It is an embarrassing position to take for many of his colleagues. Look at what they are going through. Republican Senators who went home over this Easter break--many of them--went to town meetings where people asked this very basic question: Senator, why is it that you won't do your job? Why won't you even give a hearing to this man who was sent by the President for consideration by the Senate to fill this important vacancy? It is a hard question to answer if you take the position of Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, because the answer is that, basically, he is arguing that this President has no authority--no authority to fill this vacancy. Senator McConnell argues that we should hold this vacancy open for the rest of this calendar year into next year so that a new President--whoever that might be--would have the power to fill this vacancy. He argues that the American people will speak through this next election as to a new President and that person should have the authority. Well, what we discovered over the course of the last several weeks is this isn't about giving the American people a voice in choosing to fill that vacancy; it is about giving two individuals, the Koch brothers, the decision to fill that vacancy. These brothers have decided it is in their best interests--their political interests, their economic interests, whatever it may be--to keep this spot vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in the hopes that a Republican Presidential candidate will win the election and fill the Court vacancy with the blessing of the Koch brothers. So Republican Senators are going back to their home districts and States, basically facing the electorate in their home States, and finding it impossible to justify avoiding any consideration of this nominee. It got more difficult this morning. I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Washington Post be printed in the Record in its entirety. The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland is getting a boost for his Supreme Court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him best--his former law clerks. It goes on to say that 68 former law clerks for this judge have written to Members of Congress recommending him based on their personal experience of working professionally with him. Let me read this passage from their letter: There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland. Our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers. He has stood by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. He has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. He is a constant source of career advice and guidance. And he has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty. This article one might expect from his clerks saying what a good person he is, but they have gone out of their way to suggest to the Senate that a person of this quality and this integrity should be treated fairly--fairly. I listened to some of the comments that are being made on the Republican side about this man, and it is a long way from fairness. What they are saying to him is we don't care about where you came from. We don't care about your education. We don't care about your professional qualifications. We don't care about your career on the bench. We care that you have been nominated by President Barack Obama, and as far as Senator McConnell is concerned, enough said. If Barack Obama nominates this man, Senator McConnell has made it clear he will deny to him something that has never ever been denied to a Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United States of America: a fair hearing. That is why it is painful for a lot of Republican Senators to go back and face audiences. The partisans in the audience come in, in a predictable state, with Republicans saying: Hold the line. Don't let Obama act like a President of the United States. We want him to go away. Democrats come in and ask: Can't you at least give this man a hearing? I would say to my Republican colleagues: Listen to the people who view themselves as Independents in this country, folks who don't carry a party label. They are saying overwhelmingly that Merrick Garland is entitled to a hearing before the U.S. Senate. He is an extraordinarily well-qualified man. There is no credible justification to refuse to give him a hearing. Merrick Garland was born in Chicago. His father ran a small business. His mother volunteered in the Rogers Park neighborhood. He was the grandson of immigrants who fled anti-Semitism in the Pale of Settlement in Russia. They came to America in the early 1900s. Judge Garland grew up in Lincolnwood, IL. He graduated at the top of his class at Niles West High School in Skokie. He earned an undergraduate and law degree from Harvard. He was a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly on the Second Circuit and to Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. He had a distinguished career at the Justice Department. They sent Merrick Garland down after the Oklahoma City tragedy, when there was a terrible incident--a domestic terrorist bombing--that killed and maimed so many people. The prosecution of that accused terrorist was the highest priority for the Department of Justice. They had to get it right, not just for the cause of justice but for the victims and their families. They had to get it right on this prosecution. So they sent their very best prosecutor, Merrick [[Page S1649]] Garland. He was given that responsibility and took it very seriously. He used to carry around with him the names of those who died in that Oklahoma City terrorist incident as a reminder of the solemn responsibility which he carried in this undertaking. That is the kind of person he is. He successfully prosecuted those who were engaged in the terrorism that caused that terrible event. The Department of Justice thought that highly of him, and his performance in Oklahoma City was so stellar that he achieved his goal--a fair and effective prosecution. The Senate considered Merrick Garland for the second highest court of the land, the D.C. Circuit Court in 1997. He received a majority vote on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats. The total final vote was 76 to 23. Thirty-two Senate Republicans voted to confirm Judge Garland. He has been on that court--the D.C. Circuit--for 19 years and he has been the chief judge for the last 3 years. Throughout his lengthy judicial career, Chief Judge Garland has been praised for his intelligence, knowledge of the law, adherence to precedent, and his ability to forge a consensus. Listen to what Chief Justice John Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court said during his own confirmation hearing: ``Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.'' I have my differences with Chief Justice Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court, but I will be the first to say his presentation to the Senate Judiciary Committee was one I will never forget. He sat there for 2 days, without a note in front of him, and answered every question effectively and eloquently. I left there with the distinct impression he was one of the brightest individuals who had ever been nominated to the Supreme Court. So this man, Chief Justice Roberts, whether we agree with his politics or his decisions, should be listened to when he says of Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee, that if you disagreed with Judge Garland, you know you are in a difficult area. That is high praise from Chief Justice John Roberts. It is high praise for a man who has been denied a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time in the history of the Senate. I commend Judge Garland for his many decades of public service and congratulate him and his wife Lynn and their daughters for the great honor they have been given to be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. I offer as well a word of apology to them for the way they are being treated by the U.S. Senate. This is not right. I hope that in the quiet and the solitude of their own Republican caucus lunch, they will close the door and turn to one another and say: This is not fair. It is not right. We owe this man a hearing. I am not saying he should be rubberstamped. I am not saying the Senate Republican majority should approve this man, although I think it is difficult not to. I am saying he should be given a hearing. He deserves that respect from the U.S. Senate. It would be terrible and beneath the dignity of the Senate Republicans to close the doors of the Senate to such an accomplished American and deny him a fair hearing and a vote. The President has met his responsibility. The Senate should do no less. I know Merrick Garland is in for a rough ride. The senior Senator from Texas said as much a few weeks ago. He said President Obama's Supreme Court nominee would ``bear some resemblance to a pinata.'' Do we know what that means? Remember, if you will, that Mexican custom of filling a paper mache animal with candy, then blindfolding a child and giving him a stick or a bat to try to swing wildly and beat on that pinata until it is broken open and the candy hits the floor. That was the analogy used by the senior Senator from Texas as to how Merrick Garland should expect to be treated if his nomination comes before the Senate. It is a sad commentary, but it may reflect the reality of the bitter political environment we live in. It is troubling to hear our nomination process in the Senate characterized this way. There is a way to avoid pinata politics. Let's give Merrick Garland a fair hearing. Right now, conservative groups and some Senate Republicans are taking their swings blindly at Merrick Garland. They are flailing around, hoping to find some argument to justify the mistreatment which they are offering. For example, there is a rightwing advocacy group calling itself the Judicial Crisis Network, whatever that is, that recently announced a multi-State ad campaign against Judge Garland. How about that. They will not give him a hearing. They will not even let him sit down in a chair under oath and face questions and give answers, but they have started a multi-State ad campaign against him. The campaign said that with Garland on the bench, the Second Amendment would be ``gutted'' because ``in two separate cases, Garland has demonstrated his strong hostility to gun owner rights.'' Several Senate Republicans have echoed this attack. They have heard this so-called Judicial Crisis Network ad and they have decided to amplify it. However, there is no argument that can be made seriously or fairly for the proposition that Judge Garland opposes the Second Amendment in his rulings. There are two cases mentioned by this rightwing organization on the subject. They date back many years to 2000 and 2007. The first was a case involving the auditing of background check records. When that case was appealed to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department of President George W. Bush, led by conservative Attorney General John Ashcroft, agreed with Judge Garland's position. There was no controversy as far as they were concerned. So a Republican President and a Republican Attorney General agreed with the ruling of Judge Garland. In the other case in which Judge Garland is accused of having overstepped the bounds on the Second Amendment, he never even addressed any substantive Second Amendment issue. If the Judicial Crisis Network was so outraged by these decisions in the year 2000 and the year 2007, why didn't they bring it up in 2010 when Merrick Garland was in the running to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court? In that year, Carrie Severino, the head of that organization--the Judicial Crisis Network--told the Washington Post: Of those the President could nominate, we can do a lot worse than Merrick Garland. He's the best scenario we could hope for to bring the tension and the politics in the city down a notch for the summer. I just quoted the person who was in charge of the Judicial Crisis Network when Merrick Garland was under consideration for the Supreme Court six years ago. Now that same network has decided to spend millions of dollars to stop this nominee. If Judge Garland's views on the Second Amendment were so objectionable, why has he been praised by Charles Cooper, the gun lobby's top outside attorney? On March 28 of this year, Cooper told the Washington Post about his ``high opinion'' of Garland as a judge. So here is the reality. Rightwing advocacy groups like the Judicial Crisis Network are swinging wildly at Judge Garland. They mischaracterize his record and they attack his judgment in an effort to discredit him. If the Senate holds a public hearing for Garland, he would at least have his day to state his position clearly on the Second Amendment, but they are so afraid of what he is going to say, the Republican leadership in the Senate has denied Merrick Garland an opportunity for a hearing at this point in time. At a hearing, the American people could judge for themselves. How about that for a novel idea; that we would put Merrick Garland under oath, sit him at a table, ask whatever questions we consider to be important for his nomination, and then let the American people decide. The Republicans will have nothing to do with that. Senator McConnell has said from the start he is never going to allow that to occur. The Senate is doing Judge Garland and our Nation a grave disservice if we don't move forward with a public hearing on this nomination, as we have with every other Supreme Court nominee that has been sent by a President. Just for the record, go back to 1987, when a vacancy occurred on the Supreme Court, and in 1988, the last year of Ronald Reagan's Republican Presidency, he sent a nominee to the U.S. Senate to be considered. Anthony Kennedy was a Reagan nominee, and the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate not only gave Anthony Kennedy a hearing, [[Page S1650]] they gave him a unanimous vote, sending him to the Supreme Court. Despite the fact that Ronald Reagan was a ``lameduck''--the last year of his Presidency--the Senate at that time respected the Office of the Presidency and respected the Constitution enough to give Anthony Kennedy his day before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his day before the U.S. Senate. If it was fair enough for a Republican President in a Democratic Senate, why isn't the same standard to be used when it comes to President Obama's nominee being sent to the Senate on this day? It cannot be explained away. What does this vacancy on the Supreme Court mean? There are only eight members of a nine-member Court. Already the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice on 4-to-4 tie votes since Justice Scalia's passing. Almost 50 cases still need to be decided in this term. Major legal questions may go unresolved because the Senate is not doing its job and not filling this vacancy. Judge Garland does not deserve to be used as a pinata--a word used by a Senate Republican describing what he would face in the Senate. Let's give him an opportunity to rebut any attacks made against him. Let him explain himself on the record in full view of the American public. Let the American people decide if the ads and attacks against him are valid or baseless. I urge my Republican colleagues: Do not follow the lead of rightwing advocacy groups and attack Judge Garland's character or record when you refuse to give the man a chance to respond at a public hearing. That is fundamentally unfair. This is a real moment of truth for the Senate. No Supreme Court nominee has ever been denied a hearing before, and Merrick Garland should not be the first. The message of the American people to the Senate Republican majority is very simple, three words: Do your job. Do your job under the Constitution. Have a hearing. Be fair to this man. Don't dream up excuses. Don't argue with this President who won by 5 million votes over Mitt Romney. Don't disrespect the Office of the Presidency or the Constitution, which in its clarity establishes our responsibility to give a hearing to this nominee. My Republican colleagues need to do their job and to schedule a hearing for Merrick Garland without delay. Mr. President, I yield the floor. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Garland's Ex-Clerks: Confirm Our Old Boss (By Mike DeBonis) U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland is getting a boost for his Supreme Court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him best: his former law clerks. Sixty-eight former Garland clerks signed a letter delivered Monday to Senate leaders of both parties, urging them to confirm his nomination. The signers comprise all but three of the ex-clerks Garland has employed since he joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1997. And the three holdouts have a good reason: They are clerks for Supreme Court justices. The three-page tribute is both professional and personal. ``There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland,'' the ex-clerks write. ``Our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers. He has stood by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. He has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. He is a constant source of career advice and guidance. And he has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty.'' Clerkships on the D.C. Circuit are among the nation's most prestigious, second only to the Supreme Court itself. The signers have gone on to high-level positions in federal and state government, private practices and academia. Several have spent time in the office of the White House counsel; one of those lawyers, Danielle Gray, served as Cabinet secretary to President Obama. The letter paints a familiar portrait of Garland as a careful judge, a hard-working public servant and a devoted family man. But it also offers a couple of glimpses behind the curtain. In one notable passage, the clerks write that Garland ``taught us the value of diversity, in all its forms.'' ``We observed how Chief Judge Garland forged meaningful connections with others from a wide array of backgrounds and ideological perspectives--from the law clerks he hires to the personal and professional relationships he maintains. He finds camaraderie with his fellow judges without regard to who nominated them to the bench. Chief Judge Garland deeply believes that our system of justice works best when those who see things differently are able to work together, in a collegial manner, to arrive at a just result. And when he must disagree with his colleagues, he always does so respectfully.'' And they describe how his private response to the Sept 11, 2001, attacks had a profound impression on the four clerks who were working for him at the time: ``From his chambers, we watched with horror the news about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the days after, we remember the explicit importance Chief Judge Garland placed on coming to the office everyday and continuing to prepare for upcoming cases. In the aftermath of that terrible tragedy, he believed it was more important than ever for the American people to see that their system of government was functioning without interruption--that the rule of law endured!'' Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to join in the remarks just made by the senior Senator from Illinois that we have an obligation to do our job and to provide a hearing and a vote for the President's nominee--not as a matter of discretion or convenience but as a mandatory obligation we have as Members of this body. It is an obligation that comes from the Constitution, which says that we shall exercise this duty of advising and consenting. For all the reasons my colleague has expressed so eloquently, the American people feel that it is our job, and they are right. Nothing so epitomizes the feeling of the American people that Washington is failing to work, that this body is failing to do its job, that the Congress and the Federal Government are failing the American people, than the failure to deal with this nominee. The refusal to even meet with him mocks the American system of justice. For all who care about the quality of our judicial nominee, this intransigence is both an insult and an injury, and it will do lasting damage to the Court if it drags this third branch of government into the mire of partisan bickering. The judicial branch depends, for the enforceability of its decisions, on the trust and credibility of the American people that it is above politics and that decisions made by the judicial branch are on the merits without regard to the special interests and the money that so infects this branch, and they are entitled to our support for the credibility and trust of the judicial branch, and nothing epitomizes the need for that credibility and trust more than the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the highest Court in the land, and it is the most powerful. It is an anomaly in a democratic government because it is unelected, appointed for life, at the top of the judicial pyramid, exercising vast powers, with only the trust and credibility of the American people as its means of enforcement. It has no army or police of its own. Its decisions and enforceability depend for their effect on it being above politics. The controversy and the intransigence and refusal to even consider this nominee is a great threat to that institution. Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act Mr. President, on the issue of getting the job done, I want to go to a separate topic very much on our minds at this time of year, very distinct and different, but I want to join it in these remarks because it is timely as we begin the next phase of our bipartisan efforts to combat Lyme and tick-borne diseases. We will be building support this week for a bill that has been introduced by Senator Ayotte and me, with the strong involvement and leadership of Senator Gillibrand, S. 1503, the Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act, with 13 cosponsors. It is a bipartisan bill that is critically important to public health. Today we will be welcoming a number of my friends and constituents from Connecticut and around the country who are experts to provide briefings [[Page S1651]] to our staffs in sessions that have been organized by Senator Ayotte, Senator Gillibrand, and me. We are very pleased to welcome some of the leaders of this effort: John Aucott, who is an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Dr. Brian Fallon, a good friend and leading expert in this area and a professor at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; Ally Hilfiger, who has been a survivor and strong supporter and advocate; Rebecca Tibball, a fourth grade teacher from my home State of Connecticut who has been battling Lyme disease since August of 2014; and David Roth, also a leader and a longstanding patient advocate from New York who in his day job is a managing director at the private sector group Blackstone. These individuals are here to call attention to and build support for curing a disease that is literally exploding exponentially in this country and now constitutes an epidemic that literally impinges and cripples the lives of millions of Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that more than 36,000 Americans suffered from Lyme disease in 2013. It says that the number who actually contracted this disease is probably 10 times higher because it is undetected and undiagnosed in so many people and it is underreported even when it is discovered in individuals. Most of the cases of Lyme disease occur in a limited number of States. Ninety- eight percent of them occur in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. I name those States because the Senators in those States ought to be behind this bill, every single one of them. But those cases are only the ones reported. In many States there is no systematic reporting of Lyme disease, so the full extent, breadth, and depth of this epidemic is truly unknown. We know in this body how to respond and recognize a public health threat. It was done for Ebola. It is done for influenza. It hopefully will be done for Zika. What is needed is the same kind of bipartisan awareness and support for legislation to help people who suffer from Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Sometimes this Senator is asked: Why has the Congress failed to recognize and respond to this severe public health threat? There is no good explanation except for the underreporting and the unawareness, and that is no excuse. In the meantime, the cases of Lyme disease are exploding in number, and the severity impacts our economy as well as the quality of life for Americans. It affects people's ability to perform their jobs, children's ability to go to school, and families' ability to function normally. The disease, if undetected and untreated, can cause the most severe kinds of pain and disability. Lyme disease is named after a town in my State. I have always felt it was tremendously unfair for the beautiful and wonderful town of Lyme to have its name bear the burden of this disease, but regardless of the name, the burden is on the entire country--not simply on Connecticut and not simply on the Northeast or any part of the country or profession--to take action. That action must include provisions in this bill to strengthen Lyme disease surveillance and reporting, an education program, establishing epidemiological research objectives for tick-borne diseases, and the preparation of a regular report to Congress on the progress of efforts to combat these devastating tick- borne diseases. The effects are devastating, pernicious, and insidious, creeping into every aspect of a victim's life. Our bill has earned the support of 13 Senators from both parties, including five members of the HELP Committee. When it comes to fighting Lyme disease, there is no partisanship. The ticks that carry this disease don't know a red State from a blue one. They don't make any discrimination between the boundaries of different States. The devastating diseases that can spring from these ticks are common to our entire country and therefore demand a national response and a Federal program that we have outlined in this bill. I am proud to join with Senator Ayotte and Senator Gillibrand in this effort. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to send your staffs to the briefing we have today. I thank others from Connecticut--such as Alexandra Cohen--who are going to be coming today, and I look forward to continuing this fight, which has to be one of a nationwide commitment. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from South Dakota. ISIS Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to address last month's tragic terror attacks in Brussels and Istanbul by ISIS. It is critical for the Senate to consider these significant events as we get back to work on bills enhancing security and setting policies for air transportation. In Brussels, 35 innocent people, including four Americans, lost their lives in barbaric attacks by ISIS at a subway station and airport terminal. In Istanbul, an ISIS suicide bombing killed four on Central Street and left dozens more injured. My thoughts and prayers are with those injured, the families of the victims, and the citizens of Belgium and Turkey. In the past 2 years, ISIS has orchestrated 29 attacks on Western targets around the world, killing more than 650 innocent people. A decade ago, the group of violent jihadists behind ISIS fit a fairly conventional definition of a terrorist group. Operating in Iraq, they endeavored to kill Americans, Iraqis, and others working to build a free and democratic nation. Today, however, calling ISIS a mere terrorist group may not fully convey the seriousness of the problem. ISIS, or the so-called Islamic State, has taken control of a significant amount of territory in Iraq and Syria. Within this territory, ISIS has established a self- proclaimed capital city and effective sovereignty over other populated urban centers. It collects taxes, operates and profits from oil well operations, controls banking, and rules over substantial agricultural acreage. These operations help fund and sustain not only ISIS armed fighters but also the group's attempt to build actual institutions that spread its message of hate. Unfortunately, ISIS has enjoyed considerable success communicating and spreading its distorted vision of a grand Islamic caliphate claiming authority over all Muslims. Branches of ISIS, trying to replicate what has happened in Syria and Iraq, have taken root elsewhere and carried out operations in destabilized areas, including Libya, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, and Yemen. A recent report estimated that as many as 31,000 ISIS adherents have traveled from 86 countries to join the organization in Iraq and Syria. More than 5,000 of these recruits have come from Western Europe and 150 from the United States. In addition to those Americans who have actually traveled abroad, researchers at George Washington University estimated in December that there are 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers here in the United States. Let me repeat that--900 investigations of ISIS sympathizers here in the United States. This doesn't included those who have been radicalized without noticeable warning, such as a couple in San Bernardino who weren't known to authorities before they killed 14 in a shooting attack last December. Over the past few years, ISIS's reach has expanded dramatically, and claims that our current policies have contained the organizations and its dangerous message are both false and reckless. We have had some successes in targeting senior ISIS officials, but as we saw in Brussels, in San Bernardino, and elsewhere, those efforts have not lessened the threat posed by a terrorist state that is successfully propagating its ideology all over the world. So what can we do to protect against the threat posed by ISIS? Here are a few things: First, we need a President who is committed to forming a robust coalition to destroy ISIS abroad. Real American leadership against ISIS must be manifested in sustained engagement against the enemy. We need an administration intent on eliminating the group's sources of income and its control of territory which facilitates an illusion of legitimacy for its followers. Incremental progress is not enough. Indeed, the Washington Post reported last week that some terrorism experts believe pressure on the group's finances [[Page S1652]] could make ISIS more dangerous and unpredictable until it is defeated. Second, we need to control our borders. We need to know who is coming in and out of our country and why. This includes screening travelers for ties to ISIS and to its sympathizers. One of the greatest threats facing Europe is citizens who leave their homes to fight for ISIS and then return to recruit or conduct operations in their communities. We also face this threat from European ISIS fighters, the return of American citizens who have fought for ISIS, and agents of ISIS posing as war refugees. Although we have passed bipartisan legislation to tighten some screening requirements, we need the administration to enforce the law rather than attempt to undermine and work around it. Third, as a final line of defense, we need to better secure the homeland. We must make sure the intelligence community, law enforcement, and Homeland Security officials have the tools they need to deter attacks and to stop plots before they are launched. This includes the need for constant reassessment of our vulnerabilities so we stay ahead of threats. Tomorrow I will chair a hearing at the Commerce Committee with Transportation Security Administration Administrator Peter Neffenger, who happened to be in Brussels during the March 22 attacks. While we mainly see and know the Transportation Security Administration or TSA as the agency behind airport screening of passengers and baggage, the organization actually has a much broader charge. TSA is the designated Federal agency for all transportation security matters. As we know from independent covert testing that exposed TSA failures a year ago, TSA still has work to do to improve screening at airports, but TSA also needs to focus on securing transportation by train, bus, pipelines, and through our ports. The diversity of the targets ISIS selected in its most recent attacks--a subway station, an unsecured airport terminal, and a busy street, underscores the challenge of protecting our citizens from an enemy seeking the path of least resistance to maximize its carnage. To stay ahead of this danger, security officials at TSA and other agencies need to be looking at potential threats before ISIS does. Congress has a role in helping security officials stay ahead of ISIS. Aided by congressional oversight and congressional watchdogs, the Commerce Committee has already approved bipartisan legislation that Senator Bill Nelson and I have offered to address airport security vulnerabilities. Our bill is cosponsored by the Homeland Security Committee's chair and ranking member, Senator Johnson and Senator Carper. Among other provisions, our legislation improves the vetting process for airport workers seeking or holding a security credential that grants access to restricted sections of an airport. Over the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers have been caught in the act helping criminal organizations. On March 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine after she was confronted by airport security officials in California. In Florida, on March 26, an airline gate agent was arrested with a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an associate. According to press reports, the agent told authorities the money was connected to illegal activity, but he knew few other details. Some of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in Brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals--but not terrorists. As we work to address concerns about an insider threat scenario, where an aviation worker helps terrorists, criminals who have broken laws for their own financial gain and those with histories of violence are a good place to start. Ensuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that ISIS in October killed 224 on a Russian flight leaving Egypt. Many experts believe this attack had help from an aviation employee. In S. 2361, the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act, Senator Nelson and I propose not only tightening vetting procedures for workers who need a security credential, but we also expand the list of criminal convictions that disqualifies an applicant from holding one. At present, even applicants convicted for embezzlement, racketeering, perjury, robbery, sabotage, immigration law violations, and assault with a deadly weapon can still obtain an airport security badge granting access to restricted areas. Our bill closes this loophole while updating airport security rules, expanding random inspections of airport workers, and requiring the review of airport perimeter security. The Commerce Committee has also approved another TSA-related bill, H.R. 2843, the TSA PreCheck Expansion Act. This bill would expand participation in the TSA precheck application program by developing private sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. As a result, more passengers would be vetted before they even arrived at the airport and received expedited screening. This would get passengers through security checkpoints more quickly to ensure they don't pose the kind of easy target that ISIS suicide bombers found at the Brussels Airport. Historically, this body has passed aviation security enhancements separate from a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. While I still prefer this separate approach and believe the Senate should pass our consensus security legislation without delay, I will pursue every option to enact these improvements and will vigorously oppose any effort to water down any security efforts that passed the Commerce Committee. As we look at ISIS and consider necessary steps to stop attacks, let's remember our recent history of fighting terrorism. In the 1990s, our Nation not only fell behind on intelligence and airport security, but we did not act with force against Al Qaeda's enclaves in Afghanistan. This was true even after we recognized a significant threat following attacks on our embassies in East Africa and on the USS Cole in Yemen. Only after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon did our Nation pursue a strong military response and adopt significant reforms to enhance our Homeland Security. Like Al Qaeda, ISIS is now a significant danger. While we are doing more to push our Homeland Security and intelligence agencies to meet current and future threats, we are unwise to allow this enemy time and multiple chances to inflict mass casualties. As a legislative body, we have already passed legislation closing a border security vulnerability in our Visa Waiver Program and have an opportunity in the bill that Senator Nelson and I have offered to guard against an insider threat at airports. As lawmakers, we are going in the right direction. However, our responsibility to the people we represent does not end there. Until this administration or its successor changes the facts on the ground, we also have an obligation to speak about the continued threat of ISIS, especially when the administration downplays the need for a more aggressive response. We have an obligation to continue discussing the genocide of Christians and other religious groups in areas under ISIS control, and we have an obligation to scrutinize Executive actions and conduct rigorous oversight of administration initiatives that pose risks to our homeland. If we can't do this, we have learned very little. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Congratulating the Villanova Wildcats on winning the 2016 NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on the floor to send congratulations on my own behalf and also on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania to the Villanova Wildcats for a great win last night in the NCAA final. It was a remarkable game for a lot of reasons. My wife and I watched every minute of it, as I know so many did. It was a remarkable game even before the last-second shot, but even more so after the shot made by Kris Jenkins. We are grateful, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, to commend and salute Villanova University and, of course, the team itself. [[Page S1653]] In particular, I commend the players, not only Kris Jenkins but the entire team. At the same time, we commend the work done by Jay Wright. He is a great coach. He was awarded the Naismith Award as Coach of the Year this year, but we also commend him for leading Villanova this year and for the way he conducted himself, even in the aftermath of a win. We learn a lot about people in victory and defeat, whether that is in the athletic contest or even in politics or life itself. I thought Jay Wright showed a lot of class in the way he conducted himself after winning, which is sometimes not the case in sports today. I want to commend them as well for their great teamwork that obviously has to play out not just on the court in one game but over the length of a season--the practice and the hard work and the working together and the way they built each other up. There are so many instances where this team really was a team in reality, not just in terms of people talking about them as a team. I am not sure they could have shot better. I am told--and I hope I have this right--they had a 58-percent shooting field goal percentage throughout the tournament. That is a remarkable achievement. Again, that doesn't just happen; it happens because of hard work and because of a great coach. I want to commend and salute the team and congratulate them on winning a very difficult tournament. This is a tournament that had a lot of upsets and a lot of twists and turns before the team came out No. 1. That is a great achievement. Finally, I commend and salute the university and Father Peter Donahue, the president. We know him as Father Peter. I want to thank him. He sent me a Villanova hat, which I wore during the semifinal game or part of the game. I made sure I wore it at least for a few minutes during the final game. I was grateful he sent me that reminder of team spirit. In addition to Father Peter in the larger Villanova community, we want to salute the students, who were so loyal, and the fans, who may not have been students but who were either graduates of Villanova or just supporters. And of course the alumni made it possible for the team to have the kind of support they have had over many years. Opioid Epidemic and Children's Exposure to Lead Poisoning Mr. President, in my recent travels across Pennsylvania, two issues arose that I know the Presiding Officer and others may have heard about in the time they were away from Washington, and I know there are many others, but I will just mention two that the people of our State are thinking a lot about and are worried about and expect us to take action concerning. No. 1 is the opioid epidemic across the country, which has caused the kind of death and devastation that none of us can even begin to imagine. In Pennsylvania alone, more than 2,700 people died in 2014 as a result of some kind of drug overdose. So this is a major challenge. We made tremendous progress when we passed our bipartisan bill here, the so-called CARA bill. That was a good move and an important step for the Senate. I hope we can follow up on that with the $600 million in funding that local law enforcement and treatment experts and others have asked us for. We need to finish the job in terms of making sure the Senate is taking the right steps on this challenge. The second issue--which I will mention just briefly because we don't have time today to develop it further--is lead poisoning in children. We know what happened in Flint, the horror and the tragedy of Flint, but in a State such as mine, the biggest challenge we have is not necessarily lead from water or in the water systems that would adversely affect children. In our case, because we have a lot of old homes, it is lead paint and the exposure to lead paint and the high lead levels that put children in a precarious situation in the short run but even long term because some of these impacts, if the levels are very high, can be irreversible. We have to make sure we are doing more to protect our children not only in Pennsylvania but across the country in terms of making sure that fewer and fewer children are exposed to high lead levels. I know we will talk more about that. Those are two major challenges that I know confront Pennsylvania and also confront our country. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy and Working Together in the Senate Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as you know, we have been back home in our States for the last couple of weeks or traveling, listening to our constituents. It was great to be back home and to spend some time talking to the people who I work for about the challenges facing our country and what we have been doing in the U.S. Senate to try to address those challenges. While it is always true that people wish there would be more consensus building and more solutions offered, I would say that, by and large, people feel we had a pretty productive 2015 and are hoping we can continue that sort of productivity here in the Senate in 2016, even though this is a Presidential election year. Yesterday was a good example of that productivity. We passed a trademark enforcement piece of legislation basically without--it was unanimous, to the best of my knowledge. All the Senators here in the Chamber voted for it without going through the official procedural hoops that are required in order to process legislation here in the Senate. Previously we passed legislation--recently the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--to deal with the crisis involving opioid or prescription drug painkillers that are being abused around the country, and people are unfortunately falling into that trap, and then the cheap heroin that sometimes is used as a substitute if people can't find the opioid prescription drugs. So Congress actually has been doing the people's business here. Of course, we are in the type of profession where people will sometimes say: Well, we think you are doing a great job. And others will say: Well, we don't think you are doing quite so great a job. But that is the nature of the beast. Either way, it is always good to be back home. As I was talking to my constituents back home, I was glad to hear one thing. No matter what part of the State I was traveling in, there was appreciation for the decision we made to give the voters a voice on who makes the next lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. Texans want to have a say in who replaces Justice Scalia on our Nation's highest Court, and I believe their voice should be heard. We are already engaged in the Presidential primaries process. Today is the Wisconsin primary. It will not be that long before we have a new President who will make that appointment. I simply believe it is important--particularly in something that could extend for the next 25 or 30 years and really affect the balance of power on the Supreme Court--that this be left to the voters. We all know we did not end up in this position overnight. In fact, there is a lot of history. I remember that back when I came to the Senate, I was frustrated by the fact that there was so much politics at play in the judicial confirmation process. Having served as a State court judge for 13 years, I had some pretty strong views about that. But the problem is, there has been a lot that has transpired in the interim. Everything from the Biden rule to the Reid statement in 2005 was really a threat saying that if President George W. Bush were to appoint a judge to the Supreme Court, it was within the authority of the U.S. Senate not to hold a vote on that appointment. That was in 2005. That was the Democratic leader. And then in 2007 when George W. Bush was still President, 18 months before he left office, Senator Schumer, the next Democratic leader, said there should be a presumption against confirmation. This is something that is nearly unprecedented. Then we know that in the interim there has been this development of filibusters or the requirement of 60 votes in order to get judges confirmed brought to us by our [[Page S1654]] Democratic friends, as well as something we didn't think would ever happen but, in fact, did happen under Democratic leadership: the so- called nuclear option--in other words, breaking the Senate rules in order to confirm judges mainly to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--what some call the second most powerful court in the Nation--in order to pack that court with judges who are more likely to affirm President Obama's constitutional overreach. So, as I said, much to my chagrin and I bet to a lot of people's chagrin, we have seen the playbook torn up by our Democratic colleagues and rewritten. The question is, Are we going to be operating under a different set of rules than they would if the roles were reversed? Frankly, my constituents back home think the rules ought to be the same no matter who happens to be in the majority and who happens to be in the White House. Even more significantly, the Supreme Court is the final authority for many of the most pressing issues that face our country. The Court often acts as a constitutional counterweight to the passions of both the legislative and executive branches. We have seen the Supreme Court operate time and time again as a check on the Obama administration's lawless actions. We saw this in the recess-appointment case. We have seen it in a number of different cases where the Court has said to the Obama administration: You have simply overextended your reach beyond legitimate boundaries. I am thankful for that important counterbalance in our government and the give-and-take that the Founding Fathers intended for us to have with three coequal branches of government. But, as I said, the next Supreme Court Justice could well change the ideological direction of the Court for a generation. Rightly or wrongly, the Supreme Court has the final word on issues as varied as the scope of the President's power, the ability of the States to make their own decisions about self-government, and questions of personal liberty and the like. The Court can and has made all the difference in the world, and one Justice can affect that for a long time. We recall Justice Scalia as somebody who believed that the words of the Constitution mattered greatly, and he served on the Court for 30 years. Justice Scalia was what was sometimes called an originalist. In other words, he believed the Court had an obligation to apply the Constitution and the law as written, not based on some substituted value judgment for what perhaps the unelected, lifetime-tenured judges would have preferred in terms of policy. That is not their role. They don't stand for election. It is our role as the policymakers in the political branches who do stand for election--and thus give the American people a chance to voice their pleasure or displeasure, as the case may be, with the direction that we perhaps take the country when it comes to policy. But that is not a role the Supreme Court should play. We need to approach filling this seat with great care. The administration and their liberal allies are now trying to basically throw everything but the kitchen sink at stopping the American people from getting a voice in this matter. In other words, they are trying to force Congress's hand or the Senate's hand to confirm the Presidential nominee at this time. They are spending millions of dollars on TV advertising. They have hired consultants, and they found some sympathetic allies in the media to criticize us. I don't begrudge anybody who has a different point of view than I do about this, but I simply cannot in good conscience vote to confirm another Obama nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court in the waning days of this President's term in office. I happen to believe we should not process this nomination. We should exercise the power we have under the Constitution to grant or withhold consent, and in this case to withhold consent. But here we are, several weeks after the President announced his nominee, and nothing has really changed. All the money and the consultants in the world are not going to change the fact that the American people are going to have their say. We don't know exactly how that will turn out, but that is because this is based not on the personality of the nominee but on the principle that the American people should have their voice heard. As I said, the President has the authority to nominate anybody he chooses, but that doesn't change our responsibility or our authority under that same Constitution. We remain committed to the idea that this vacancy should be filled by the next President. I want to be clear that the American people do deserve a voice here, and we will make sure they are heard. In the meantime, as I started out saying, there are a lot of things we can do working together. Just because we disagree about this one item doesn't mean we have to disagree about everything or that Congress needs to lapse into dysfunction. We currently have a bill pending before us involving the Federal Aviation Administration and the very important topic of safe and secure air travel. We can disagree about how to proceed with the President's nominee to the Supreme Court and still work together to pass other good consensus legislation. So I hope all of us, our colleagues across the aisle and on this side of the aisle, will continue to work together to do things I think would help the country a lot, things such as criminal justice reform--a bill that has been voted out of the Judiciary Committee, that enjoys broad bipartisan support, and that the President of the United States has said he supports. There is also other important legislation that I am very concerned about and interested in involving the intersection of mental illness with our criminal justice system and the fact that our jails have become the de facto warehouses for people with mental illness who are going untreated and obviously the homeless who are living on our streets, many of whom are suffering from mental illness. I hope we can continue to work together on these other consensus matters even though we disagree about this one very important matter. I am confident that we can and we will. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, during the recess last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, President Obama's nominee to fill the existing vacancy of an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. During our meeting, we discussed the role of the Supreme Court and protecting the civil rights of Americans. We discussed a number of national security challenges, including those relating to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We discussed the Citizens United case and campaign finance law. We talked about the respect for each branch of government and our constitutional system of checks and balances. We spoke about the important role of precedent in our judicial decisions and the need to build consensus on decisions. We discussed the value of promoting pro bono work in the legal profession and the need to address the growing access-to-justice gap. I was pleased to hear that as an attorney at the Justice Department, Chief Justice Garland worked to clarify ethics rules to allow government lawyers to engage in additional pro bono work. What I was doing is what I hope every Member in the Senate will do, and that is finding out more about Judge Garland, his judicial philosophy, the way he has conducted his life, his respect for the Constitution and the precedents of the judicial branch of government, looking at current issues and seeing how Judge Garland views those current issues. That is all part of a confirmation process. The President, under the Constitution, has done his job; that is, he has made the nomination of who he believes should fill Justice Scalia's vacancy. It is now up to the Senate to do [[Page S1655]] our job, and our job starts with Members of the Senate meeting with Judge Garland to be able to see one-on-one, without cameras glaring, how Judge Garland responds to our individual issues. We obviously have his record, his background, his public service, what he has done as a lawyer, what he has done as a prosecutor, and what he has done as a judge on the circuit court. We also should have a confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, which will give us more information. Under the Constitution, the responsibility of the President is to make the nomination. It is now up to the Senate to do our job, and our job is to consider that nominee, for each Senator to learn as much as they possibly can--this is a critically important position, obviously, the Supreme Court of the United States--and for the institution to hold hearings and to vote. Each Senator will have to make his or her own judgment on whether we should vote for or against confirmation, but we have a responsibility to consider that nomination and a responsibility to vote. I must say that I was very impressed by the nominee during the course of our meeting. He has impeccable qualifications as a prosecutor, judge, and now chief judge of what many call the second highest court in the land. The Senate confirmed Judge Garland on a bipartisan basis for his current judgeship, which he has held for nearly two decades. Chief Judge Garland strikes me as a thoughtful and deliberate person who has dedicated his life to public service. And I am proud to say that the nominee is a Marylander and lives in Bethesda in Montgomery County, MD. Chief Judge Garland is the nominee for the Supreme Court and should be dealt with in this term of Congress. It is not a matter for the next President and the next Congress; it is a matter for this President and this Congress. There are 9 months left in this year, and to suggest that we don't have the time and the President doesn't have the authority to appoint a nominee is outrageous, and it is an affront to the Constitution. This nomination is not about popularity or politics; it is about finding the next Justice who will advance the rule of law in this country, who will recognize the responsibility of the Supreme Court to be the final arbiter on constitutional issues, and having a person who can bring about greater consensus among his colleagues. As more of my colleagues meet Judge Garland, they will see that this is one of his many strengths. We need to go through the process and give Chief Judge Garland a chance. I think it is hard to understand how you are excused from doing your job for 9 months by not having a confirmation hearing or vote. I don't think the American people understand that. Quite frankly, I don't understand that. I don't understand why we are not going through the regular order. Regular order would be for us individually to meet with Judge Garland and for the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing and to schedule a timely vote on the floor of the Senate. I think more and more Senators will come to that conclusion. The President did his job, and it is now time for the Senate to do its job. The American people want to see nine Justices on the Supreme Court when it convenes its new term in October. We have a new term beginning in October of this year. We expect to see nine Justices on the Court to make decisions. You don't resolve issues on a 4-to-4 vote. We hopefully will have greater consensus. We shouldn't have a divided Court. We should be able to get more collegiality on the Supreme Court, but we also should be able to make a decision. The Supreme Court needs to be able to make a decision. With eight Justices, in too many cases they are not going to be able to make a decision. Article II, section 2, of the Constitution states that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.'' The President has no alternative under the Constitution but to make a nomination when there is a vacancy. There is a vacancy on the Supreme Court due to Justice Scalia's untimely death. The President did his job. The Constitution says very clearly that we--the Senate--have to advise and consent. That is our requirement. That is not optional; we have that as a requirement. Never have we denied an opportunity to consider a Supreme Court nominee. It is now up to us to consider that nominee, and we should consider that nominee by doing our job--interviewing Judge Garland, scheduling a committee hearing, and voting on that nominee. The American people twice elected President Obama to a 4-year term in office. Their voice has been heard very clearly. Elections have consequences, and President Obama has carried out the constitutional responsibilities and duties of his office by nominating Judge Garland as the successor to Justice Scalia. The President is simply doing the job the American people elected him to do. The President doesn't stop working simply because it is an election year. He has more than 9 months left in office, as do Senators who will face the voters in November. Congress should not stop working, either, in this election year. Of course, every Senator has the right to make his or her own judgment on whether they will vote for or against confirmation. Senators were elected for 6-year terms by the citizens of their States and have the right and obligation to vote as they see fit. President Obama was elected by the people of the United States for two 4-year terms and has the right and obligation to nominate judges. History has shown that when the roles were reversed and Democrats held the majority in the Senate, Supreme Court and judicial nominees for Republican Presidents were given hearings and up-or-down votes regardless of when the vacancies occurred. While I might have picked different judges, as a Senator, I voted to confirm the vast majority of President Bush's judicial nominations in his final year in office. I will continue to carry out my constitutional responsibilities that I undertook when I became a Senator and swore to support the Constitution. Let me remind my colleagues that a democratically controlled Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court during the last year of President Ronald Reagan's final term in 1988. Senators also confirmed Justice Murphy in 1940, Justice Cardozo in 1932, and Justice Brandeis in 1916. The precedent of the Senate indicates that we need to take up this nominee. What the Republicans are effectively trying to do is temporarily shrink the Supreme Court from nine to eight Justices and shorten the term of the President from 4 years to 3 years. Why? Because the President is of a different party than the Senate. This is disgraceful and indefensible. Let me quote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 as the first female Justice of the Supreme Court. When asked about the vacancy on the Court created by the death of Justice Scalia, Justice O'Connor said, ``We need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' I agree with Justice O'Connor. Let's do our job and fulfill the Senate's constitutional responsibilities and vote up or down on Judge Garland's nomination. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1648-S1655] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 636, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 55, H.R. 636, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is an old verse that reads, if I remember correctly, as follows: While I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish that man would go away. That man in the U.S. Senate is Merrick Garland, a person whom I am sure the Republican leadership wishes would just go away. But he is not going to go away. Merrick Garland is the nominee whom President Obama has sent forward to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court occasioned by the untimely death of Antonin Scalia. In sending that name forward, President Obama was meeting his constitutional responsibility. Article II, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution states clearly that the President shall--shall-- nominate a person to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. It goes on to say that the responsibility of the Senate is to provide advice and consent to Supreme Court nominations. It is very clear. The men who wrote the Constitution understood the importance of filling a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, and they understood it to be so important that they mandated that the President send the nominee forward to fill that vacancy. You can read that Constitution from start to finish and never find the rationale being used by Senator McConnell, the majority leader of the Senate, to stop that nomination from being considered in the Senate. There is no argument made in the Constitution--nor has there ever been an argument made--that because the President is in the last year of his 4-year term, he no longer has a constitutional responsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. In fact, never-- underline never--has the Senate refused a hearing to a nominee who has been sent forward by a President of the United States to fill this important vacancy. It speaks volumes that Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, has decided--has taken it on himself--to stop the Senate from considering the President's nominee. It is an embarrassing position to take for many of his colleagues. Look at what they are going through. Republican Senators who went home over this Easter break--many of them--went to town meetings where people asked this very basic question: Senator, why is it that you won't do your job? Why won't you even give a hearing to this man who was sent by the President for consideration by the Senate to fill this important vacancy? It is a hard question to answer if you take the position of Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, because the answer is that, basically, he is arguing that this President has no authority--no authority to fill this vacancy. Senator McConnell argues that we should hold this vacancy open for the rest of this calendar year into next year so that a new President--whoever that might be--would have the power to fill this vacancy. He argues that the American people will speak through this next election as to a new President and that person should have the authority. Well, what we discovered over the course of the last several weeks is this isn't about giving the American people a voice in choosing to fill that vacancy; it is about giving two individuals, the Koch brothers, the decision to fill that vacancy. These brothers have decided it is in their best interests--their political interests, their economic interests, whatever it may be--to keep this spot vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in the hopes that a Republican Presidential candidate will win the election and fill the Court vacancy with the blessing of the Koch brothers. So Republican Senators are going back to their home districts and States, basically facing the electorate in their home States, and finding it impossible to justify avoiding any consideration of this nominee. It got more difficult this morning. I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Washington Post be printed in the Record in its entirety. The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland is getting a boost for his Supreme Court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him best--his former law clerks. It goes on to say that 68 former law clerks for this judge have written to Members of Congress recommending him based on their personal experience of working professionally with him. Let me read this passage from their letter: There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland. Our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers. He has stood by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. He has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. He is a constant source of career advice and guidance. And he has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty. This article one might expect from his clerks saying what a good person he is, but they have gone out of their way to suggest to the Senate that a person of this quality and this integrity should be treated fairly--fairly. I listened to some of the comments that are being made on the Republican side about this man, and it is a long way from fairness. What they are saying to him is we don't care about where you came from. We don't care about your education. We don't care about your professional qualifications. We don't care about your career on the bench. We care that you have been nominated by President Barack Obama, and as far as Senator McConnell is concerned, enough said. If Barack Obama nominates this man, Senator McConnell has made it clear he will deny to him something that has never ever been denied to a Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United States of America: a fair hearing. That is why it is painful for a lot of Republican Senators to go back and face audiences. The partisans in the audience come in, in a predictable state, with Republicans saying: Hold the line. Don't let Obama act like a President of the United States. We want him to go away. Democrats come in and ask: Can't you at least give this man a hearing? I would say to my Republican colleagues: Listen to the people who view themselves as Independents in this country, folks who don't carry a party label. They are saying overwhelmingly that Merrick Garland is entitled to a hearing before the U.S. Senate. He is an extraordinarily well-qualified man. There is no credible justification to refuse to give him a hearing. Merrick Garland was born in Chicago. His father ran a small business. His mother volunteered in the Rogers Park neighborhood. He was the grandson of immigrants who fled anti-Semitism in the Pale of Settlement in Russia. They came to America in the early 1900s. Judge Garland grew up in Lincolnwood, IL. He graduated at the top of his class at Niles West High School in Skokie. He earned an undergraduate and law degree from Harvard. He was a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly on the Second Circuit and to Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. He had a distinguished career at the Justice Department. They sent Merrick Garland down after the Oklahoma City tragedy, when there was a terrible incident--a domestic terrorist bombing--that killed and maimed so many people. The prosecution of that accused terrorist was the highest priority for the Department of Justice. They had to get it right, not just for the cause of justice but for the victims and their families. They had to get it right on this prosecution. So they sent their very best prosecutor, Merrick [[Page S1649]] Garland. He was given that responsibility and took it very seriously. He used to carry around with him the names of those who died in that Oklahoma City terrorist incident as a reminder of the solemn responsibility which he carried in this undertaking. That is the kind of person he is. He successfully prosecuted those who were engaged in the terrorism that caused that terrible event. The Department of Justice thought that highly of him, and his performance in Oklahoma City was so stellar that he achieved his goal--a fair and effective prosecution. The Senate considered Merrick Garland for the second highest court of the land, the D.C. Circuit Court in 1997. He received a majority vote on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats. The total final vote was 76 to 23. Thirty-two Senate Republicans voted to confirm Judge Garland. He has been on that court--the D.C. Circuit--for 19 years and he has been the chief judge for the last 3 years. Throughout his lengthy judicial career, Chief Judge Garland has been praised for his intelligence, knowledge of the law, adherence to precedent, and his ability to forge a consensus. Listen to what Chief Justice John Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court said during his own confirmation hearing: ``Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.'' I have my differences with Chief Justice Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court, but I will be the first to say his presentation to the Senate Judiciary Committee was one I will never forget. He sat there for 2 days, without a note in front of him, and answered every question effectively and eloquently. I left there with the distinct impression he was one of the brightest individuals who had ever been nominated to the Supreme Court. So this man, Chief Justice Roberts, whether we agree with his politics or his decisions, should be listened to when he says of Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee, that if you disagreed with Judge Garland, you know you are in a difficult area. That is high praise from Chief Justice John Roberts. It is high praise for a man who has been denied a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time in the history of the Senate. I commend Judge Garland for his many decades of public service and congratulate him and his wife Lynn and their daughters for the great honor they have been given to be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. I offer as well a word of apology to them for the way they are being treated by the U.S. Senate. This is not right. I hope that in the quiet and the solitude of their own Republican caucus lunch, they will close the door and turn to one another and say: This is not fair. It is not right. We owe this man a hearing. I am not saying he should be rubberstamped. I am not saying the Senate Republican majority should approve this man, although I think it is difficult not to. I am saying he should be given a hearing. He deserves that respect from the U.S. Senate. It would be terrible and beneath the dignity of the Senate Republicans to close the doors of the Senate to such an accomplished American and deny him a fair hearing and a vote. The President has met his responsibility. The Senate should do no less. I know Merrick Garland is in for a rough ride. The senior Senator from Texas said as much a few weeks ago. He said President Obama's Supreme Court nominee would ``bear some resemblance to a pinata.'' Do we know what that means? Remember, if you will, that Mexican custom of filling a paper mache animal with candy, then blindfolding a child and giving him a stick or a bat to try to swing wildly and beat on that pinata until it is broken open and the candy hits the floor. That was the analogy used by the senior Senator from Texas as to how Merrick Garland should expect to be treated if his nomination comes before the Senate. It is a sad commentary, but it may reflect the reality of the bitter political environment we live in. It is troubling to hear our nomination process in the Senate characterized this way. There is a way to avoid pinata politics. Let's give Merrick Garland a fair hearing. Right now, conservative groups and some Senate Republicans are taking their swings blindly at Merrick Garland. They are flailing around, hoping to find some argument to justify the mistreatment which they are offering. For example, there is a rightwing advocacy group calling itself the Judicial Crisis Network, whatever that is, that recently announced a multi-State ad campaign against Judge Garland. How about that. They will not give him a hearing. They will not even let him sit down in a chair under oath and face questions and give answers, but they have started a multi-State ad campaign against him. The campaign said that with Garland on the bench, the Second Amendment would be ``gutted'' because ``in two separate cases, Garland has demonstrated his strong hostility to gun owner rights.'' Several Senate Republicans have echoed this attack. They have heard this so-called Judicial Crisis Network ad and they have decided to amplify it. However, there is no argument that can be made seriously or fairly for the proposition that Judge Garland opposes the Second Amendment in his rulings. There are two cases mentioned by this rightwing organization on the subject. They date back many years to 2000 and 2007. The first was a case involving the auditing of background check records. When that case was appealed to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department of President George W. Bush, led by conservative Attorney General John Ashcroft, agreed with Judge Garland's position. There was no controversy as far as they were concerned. So a Republican President and a Republican Attorney General agreed with the ruling of Judge Garland. In the other case in which Judge Garland is accused of having overstepped the bounds on the Second Amendment, he never even addressed any substantive Second Amendment issue. If the Judicial Crisis Network was so outraged by these decisions in the year 2000 and the year 2007, why didn't they bring it up in 2010 when Merrick Garland was in the running to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court? In that year, Carrie Severino, the head of that organization--the Judicial Crisis Network--told the Washington Post: Of those the President could nominate, we can do a lot worse than Merrick Garland. He's the best scenario we could hope for to bring the tension and the politics in the city down a notch for the summer. I just quoted the person who was in charge of the Judicial Crisis Network when Merrick Garland was under consideration for the Supreme Court six years ago. Now that same network has decided to spend millions of dollars to stop this nominee. If Judge Garland's views on the Second Amendment were so objectionable, why has he been praised by Charles Cooper, the gun lobby's top outside attorney? On March 28 of this year, Cooper told the Washington Post about his ``high opinion'' of Garland as a judge. So here is the reality. Rightwing advocacy groups like the Judicial Crisis Network are swinging wildly at Judge Garland. They mischaracterize his record and they attack his judgment in an effort to discredit him. If the Senate holds a public hearing for Garland, he would at least have his day to state his position clearly on the Second Amendment, but they are so afraid of what he is going to say, the Republican leadership in the Senate has denied Merrick Garland an opportunity for a hearing at this point in time. At a hearing, the American people could judge for themselves. How about that for a novel idea; that we would put Merrick Garland under oath, sit him at a table, ask whatever questions we consider to be important for his nomination, and then let the American people decide. The Republicans will have nothing to do with that. Senator McConnell has said from the start he is never going to allow that to occur. The Senate is doing Judge Garland and our Nation a grave disservice if we don't move forward with a public hearing on this nomination, as we have with every other Supreme Court nominee that has been sent by a President. Just for the record, go back to 1987, when a vacancy occurred on the Supreme Court, and in 1988, the last year of Ronald Reagan's Republican Presidency, he sent a nominee to the U.S. Senate to be considered. Anthony Kennedy was a Reagan nominee, and the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate not only gave Anthony Kennedy a hearing, [[Page S1650]] they gave him a unanimous vote, sending him to the Supreme Court. Despite the fact that Ronald Reagan was a ``lameduck''--the last year of his Presidency--the Senate at that time respected the Office of the Presidency and respected the Constitution enough to give Anthony Kennedy his day before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his day before the U.S. Senate. If it was fair enough for a Republican President in a Democratic Senate, why isn't the same standard to be used when it comes to President Obama's nominee being sent to the Senate on this day? It cannot be explained away. What does this vacancy on the Supreme Court mean? There are only eight members of a nine-member Court. Already the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice on 4-to-4 tie votes since Justice Scalia's passing. Almost 50 cases still need to be decided in this term. Major legal questions may go unresolved because the Senate is not doing its job and not filling this vacancy. Judge Garland does not deserve to be used as a pinata--a word used by a Senate Republican describing what he would face in the Senate. Let's give him an opportunity to rebut any attacks made against him. Let him explain himself on the record in full view of the American public. Let the American people decide if the ads and attacks against him are valid or baseless. I urge my Republican colleagues: Do not follow the lead of rightwing advocacy groups and attack Judge Garland's character or record when you refuse to give the man a chance to respond at a public hearing. That is fundamentally unfair. This is a real moment of truth for the Senate. No Supreme Court nominee has ever been denied a hearing before, and Merrick Garland should not be the first. The message of the American people to the Senate Republican majority is very simple, three words: Do your job. Do your job under the Constitution. Have a hearing. Be fair to this man. Don't dream up excuses. Don't argue with this President who won by 5 million votes over Mitt Romney. Don't disrespect the Office of the Presidency or the Constitution, which in its clarity establishes our responsibility to give a hearing to this nominee. My Republican colleagues need to do their job and to schedule a hearing for Merrick Garland without delay. Mr. President, I yield the floor. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Garland's Ex-Clerks: Confirm Our Old Boss (By Mike DeBonis) U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland is getting a boost for his Supreme Court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him best: his former law clerks. Sixty-eight former Garland clerks signed a letter delivered Monday to Senate leaders of both parties, urging them to confirm his nomination. The signers comprise all but three of the ex-clerks Garland has employed since he joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1997. And the three holdouts have a good reason: They are clerks for Supreme Court justices. The three-page tribute is both professional and personal. ``There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland,'' the ex-clerks write. ``Our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers. He has stood by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. He has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. He is a constant source of career advice and guidance. And he has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty.'' Clerkships on the D.C. Circuit are among the nation's most prestigious, second only to the Supreme Court itself. The signers have gone on to high-level positions in federal and state government, private practices and academia. Several have spent time in the office of the White House counsel; one of those lawyers, Danielle Gray, served as Cabinet secretary to President Obama. The letter paints a familiar portrait of Garland as a careful judge, a hard-working public servant and a devoted family man. But it also offers a couple of glimpses behind the curtain. In one notable passage, the clerks write that Garland ``taught us the value of diversity, in all its forms.'' ``We observed how Chief Judge Garland forged meaningful connections with others from a wide array of backgrounds and ideological perspectives--from the law clerks he hires to the personal and professional relationships he maintains. He finds camaraderie with his fellow judges without regard to who nominated them to the bench. Chief Judge Garland deeply believes that our system of justice works best when those who see things differently are able to work together, in a collegial manner, to arrive at a just result. And when he must disagree with his colleagues, he always does so respectfully.'' And they describe how his private response to the Sept 11, 2001, attacks had a profound impression on the four clerks who were working for him at the time: ``From his chambers, we watched with horror the news about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the days after, we remember the explicit importance Chief Judge Garland placed on coming to the office everyday and continuing to prepare for upcoming cases. In the aftermath of that terrible tragedy, he believed it was more important than ever for the American people to see that their system of government was functioning without interruption--that the rule of law endured!'' Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to join in the remarks just made by the senior Senator from Illinois that we have an obligation to do our job and to provide a hearing and a vote for the President's nominee--not as a matter of discretion or convenience but as a mandatory obligation we have as Members of this body. It is an obligation that comes from the Constitution, which says that we shall exercise this duty of advising and consenting. For all the reasons my colleague has expressed so eloquently, the American people feel that it is our job, and they are right. Nothing so epitomizes the feeling of the American people that Washington is failing to work, that this body is failing to do its job, that the Congress and the Federal Government are failing the American people, than the failure to deal with this nominee. The refusal to even meet with him mocks the American system of justice. For all who care about the quality of our judicial nominee, this intransigence is both an insult and an injury, and it will do lasting damage to the Court if it drags this third branch of government into the mire of partisan bickering. The judicial branch depends, for the enforceability of its decisions, on the trust and credibility of the American people that it is above politics and that decisions made by the judicial branch are on the merits without regard to the special interests and the money that so infects this branch, and they are entitled to our support for the credibility and trust of the judicial branch, and nothing epitomizes the need for that credibility and trust more than the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the highest Court in the land, and it is the most powerful. It is an anomaly in a democratic government because it is unelected, appointed for life, at the top of the judicial pyramid, exercising vast powers, with only the trust and credibility of the American people as its means of enforcement. It has no army or police of its own. Its decisions and enforceability depend for their effect on it being above politics. The controversy and the intransigence and refusal to even consider this nominee is a great threat to that institution. Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act Mr. President, on the issue of getting the job done, I want to go to a separate topic very much on our minds at this time of year, very distinct and different, but I want to join it in these remarks because it is timely as we begin the next phase of our bipartisan efforts to combat Lyme and tick-borne diseases. We will be building support this week for a bill that has been introduced by Senator Ayotte and me, with the strong involvement and leadership of Senator Gillibrand, S. 1503, the Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act, with 13 cosponsors. It is a bipartisan bill that is critically important to public health. Today we will be welcoming a number of my friends and constituents from Connecticut and around the country who are experts to provide briefings [[Page S1651]] to our staffs in sessions that have been organized by Senator Ayotte, Senator Gillibrand, and me. We are very pleased to welcome some of the leaders of this effort: John Aucott, who is an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Dr. Brian Fallon, a good friend and leading expert in this area and a professor at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; Ally Hilfiger, who has been a survivor and strong supporter and advocate; Rebecca Tibball, a fourth grade teacher from my home State of Connecticut who has been battling Lyme disease since August of 2014; and David Roth, also a leader and a longstanding patient advocate from New York who in his day job is a managing director at the private sector group Blackstone. These individuals are here to call attention to and build support for curing a disease that is literally exploding exponentially in this country and now constitutes an epidemic that literally impinges and cripples the lives of millions of Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that more than 36,000 Americans suffered from Lyme disease in 2013. It says that the number who actually contracted this disease is probably 10 times higher because it is undetected and undiagnosed in so many people and it is underreported even when it is discovered in individuals. Most of the cases of Lyme disease occur in a limited number of States. Ninety- eight percent of them occur in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. I name those States because the Senators in those States ought to be behind this bill, every single one of them. But those cases are only the ones reported. In many States there is no systematic reporting of Lyme disease, so the full extent, breadth, and depth of this epidemic is truly unknown. We know in this body how to respond and recognize a public health threat. It was done for Ebola. It is done for influenza. It hopefully will be done for Zika. What is needed is the same kind of bipartisan awareness and support for legislation to help people who suffer from Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Sometimes this Senator is asked: Why has the Congress failed to recognize and respond to this severe public health threat? There is no good explanation except for the underreporting and the unawareness, and that is no excuse. In the meantime, the cases of Lyme disease are exploding in number, and the severity impacts our economy as well as the quality of life for Americans. It affects people's ability to perform their jobs, children's ability to go to school, and families' ability to function normally. The disease, if undetected and untreated, can cause the most severe kinds of pain and disability. Lyme disease is named after a town in my State. I have always felt it was tremendously unfair for the beautiful and wonderful town of Lyme to have its name bear the burden of this disease, but regardless of the name, the burden is on the entire country--not simply on Connecticut and not simply on the Northeast or any part of the country or profession--to take action. That action must include provisions in this bill to strengthen Lyme disease surveillance and reporting, an education program, establishing epidemiological research objectives for tick-borne diseases, and the preparation of a regular report to Congress on the progress of efforts to combat these devastating tick- borne diseases. The effects are devastating, pernicious, and insidious, creeping into every aspect of a victim's life. Our bill has earned the support of 13 Senators from both parties, including five members of the HELP Committee. When it comes to fighting Lyme disease, there is no partisanship. The ticks that carry this disease don't know a red State from a blue one. They don't make any discrimination between the boundaries of different States. The devastating diseases that can spring from these ticks are common to our entire country and therefore demand a national response and a Federal program that we have outlined in this bill. I am proud to join with Senator Ayotte and Senator Gillibrand in this effort. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to send your staffs to the briefing we have today. I thank others from Connecticut--such as Alexandra Cohen--who are going to be coming today, and I look forward to continuing this fight, which has to be one of a nationwide commitment. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from South Dakota. ISIS Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to address last month's tragic terror attacks in Brussels and Istanbul by ISIS. It is critical for the Senate to consider these significant events as we get back to work on bills enhancing security and setting policies for air transportation. In Brussels, 35 innocent people, including four Americans, lost their lives in barbaric attacks by ISIS at a subway station and airport terminal. In Istanbul, an ISIS suicide bombing killed four on Central Street and left dozens more injured. My thoughts and prayers are with those injured, the families of the victims, and the citizens of Belgium and Turkey. In the past 2 years, ISIS has orchestrated 29 attacks on Western targets around the world, killing more than 650 innocent people. A decade ago, the group of violent jihadists behind ISIS fit a fairly conventional definition of a terrorist group. Operating in Iraq, they endeavored to kill Americans, Iraqis, and others working to build a free and democratic nation. Today, however, calling ISIS a mere terrorist group may not fully convey the seriousness of the problem. ISIS, or the so-called Islamic State, has taken control of a significant amount of territory in Iraq and Syria. Within this territory, ISIS has established a self- proclaimed capital city and effective sovereignty over other populated urban centers. It collects taxes, operates and profits from oil well operations, controls banking, and rules over substantial agricultural acreage. These operations help fund and sustain not only ISIS armed fighters but also the group's attempt to build actual institutions that spread its message of hate. Unfortunately, ISIS has enjoyed considerable success communicating and spreading its distorted vision of a grand Islamic caliphate claiming authority over all Muslims. Branches of ISIS, trying to replicate what has happened in Syria and Iraq, have taken root elsewhere and carried out operations in destabilized areas, including Libya, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, and Yemen. A recent report estimated that as many as 31,000 ISIS adherents have traveled from 86 countries to join the organization in Iraq and Syria. More than 5,000 of these recruits have come from Western Europe and 150 from the United States. In addition to those Americans who have actually traveled abroad, researchers at George Washington University estimated in December that there are 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers here in the United States. Let me repeat that--900 investigations of ISIS sympathizers here in the United States. This doesn't included those who have been radicalized without noticeable warning, such as a couple in San Bernardino who weren't known to authorities before they killed 14 in a shooting attack last December. Over the past few years, ISIS's reach has expanded dramatically, and claims that our current policies have contained the organizations and its dangerous message are both false and reckless. We have had some successes in targeting senior ISIS officials, but as we saw in Brussels, in San Bernardino, and elsewhere, those efforts have not lessened the threat posed by a terrorist state that is successfully propagating its ideology all over the world. So what can we do to protect against the threat posed by ISIS? Here are a few things: First, we need a President who is committed to forming a robust coalition to destroy ISIS abroad. Real American leadership against ISIS must be manifested in sustained engagement against the enemy. We need an administration intent on eliminating the group's sources of income and its control of territory which facilitates an illusion of legitimacy for its followers. Incremental progress is not enough. Indeed, the Washington Post reported last week that some terrorism experts believe pressure on the group's finances [[Page S1652]] could make ISIS more dangerous and unpredictable until it is defeated. Second, we need to control our borders. We need to know who is coming in and out of our country and why. This includes screening travelers for ties to ISIS and to its sympathizers. One of the greatest threats facing Europe is citizens who leave their homes to fight for ISIS and then return to recruit or conduct operations in their communities. We also face this threat from European ISIS fighters, the return of American citizens who have fought for ISIS, and agents of ISIS posing as war refugees. Although we have passed bipartisan legislation to tighten some screening requirements, we need the administration to enforce the law rather than attempt to undermine and work around it. Third, as a final line of defense, we need to better secure the homeland. We must make sure the intelligence community, law enforcement, and Homeland Security officials have the tools they need to deter attacks and to stop plots before they are launched. This includes the need for constant reassessment of our vulnerabilities so we stay ahead of threats. Tomorrow I will chair a hearing at the Commerce Committee with Transportation Security Administration Administrator Peter Neffenger, who happened to be in Brussels during the March 22 attacks. While we mainly see and know the Transportation Security Administration or TSA as the agency behind airport screening of passengers and baggage, the organization actually has a much broader charge. TSA is the designated Federal agency for all transportation security matters. As we know from independent covert testing that exposed TSA failures a year ago, TSA still has work to do to improve screening at airports, but TSA also needs to focus on securing transportation by train, bus, pipelines, and through our ports. The diversity of the targets ISIS selected in its most recent attacks--a subway station, an unsecured airport terminal, and a busy street, underscores the challenge of protecting our citizens from an enemy seeking the path of least resistance to maximize its carnage. To stay ahead of this danger, security officials at TSA and other agencies need to be looking at potential threats before ISIS does. Congress has a role in helping security officials stay ahead of ISIS. Aided by congressional oversight and congressional watchdogs, the Commerce Committee has already approved bipartisan legislation that Senator Bill Nelson and I have offered to address airport security vulnerabilities. Our bill is cosponsored by the Homeland Security Committee's chair and ranking member, Senator Johnson and Senator Carper. Among other provisions, our legislation improves the vetting process for airport workers seeking or holding a security credential that grants access to restricted sections of an airport. Over the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers have been caught in the act helping criminal organizations. On March 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine after she was confronted by airport security officials in California. In Florida, on March 26, an airline gate agent was arrested with a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an associate. According to press reports, the agent told authorities the money was connected to illegal activity, but he knew few other details. Some of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in Brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals--but not terrorists. As we work to address concerns about an insider threat scenario, where an aviation worker helps terrorists, criminals who have broken laws for their own financial gain and those with histories of violence are a good place to start. Ensuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that ISIS in October killed 224 on a Russian flight leaving Egypt. Many experts believe this attack had help from an aviation employee. In S. 2361, the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act, Senator Nelson and I propose not only tightening vetting procedures for workers who need a security credential, but we also expand the list of criminal convictions that disqualifies an applicant from holding one. At present, even applicants convicted for embezzlement, racketeering, perjury, robbery, sabotage, immigration law violations, and assault with a deadly weapon can still obtain an airport security badge granting access to restricted areas. Our bill closes this loophole while updating airport security rules, expanding random inspections of airport workers, and requiring the review of airport perimeter security. The Commerce Committee has also approved another TSA-related bill, H.R. 2843, the TSA PreCheck Expansion Act. This bill would expand participation in the TSA precheck application program by developing private sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. As a result, more passengers would be vetted before they even arrived at the airport and received expedited screening. This would get passengers through security checkpoints more quickly to ensure they don't pose the kind of easy target that ISIS suicide bombers found at the Brussels Airport. Historically, this body has passed aviation security enhancements separate from a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. While I still prefer this separate approach and believe the Senate should pass our consensus security legislation without delay, I will pursue every option to enact these improvements and will vigorously oppose any effort to water down any security efforts that passed the Commerce Committee. As we look at ISIS and consider necessary steps to stop attacks, let's remember our recent history of fighting terrorism. In the 1990s, our Nation not only fell behind on intelligence and airport security, but we did not act with force against Al Qaeda's enclaves in Afghanistan. This was true even after we recognized a significant threat following attacks on our embassies in East Africa and on the USS Cole in Yemen. Only after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon did our Nation pursue a strong military response and adopt significant reforms to enhance our Homeland Security. Like Al Qaeda, ISIS is now a significant danger. While we are doing more to push our Homeland Security and intelligence agencies to meet current and future threats, we are unwise to allow this enemy time and multiple chances to inflict mass casualties. As a legislative body, we have already passed legislation closing a border security vulnerability in our Visa Waiver Program and have an opportunity in the bill that Senator Nelson and I have offered to guard against an insider threat at airports. As lawmakers, we are going in the right direction. However, our responsibility to the people we represent does not end there. Until this administration or its successor changes the facts on the ground, we also have an obligation to speak about the continued threat of ISIS, especially when the administration downplays the need for a more aggressive response. We have an obligation to continue discussing the genocide of Christians and other religious groups in areas under ISIS control, and we have an obligation to scrutinize Executive actions and conduct rigorous oversight of administration initiatives that pose risks to our homeland. If we can't do this, we have learned very little. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Congratulating the Villanova Wildcats on winning the 2016 NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on the floor to send congratulations on my own behalf and also on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania to the Villanova Wildcats for a great win last night in the NCAA final. It was a remarkable game for a lot of reasons. My wife and I watched every minute of it, as I know so many did. It was a remarkable game even before the last-second shot, but even more so after the shot made by Kris Jenkins. We are grateful, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, to commend and salute Villanova University and, of course, the team itself. [[Page S1653]] In particular, I commend the players, not only Kris Jenkins but the entire team. At the same time, we commend the work done by Jay Wright. He is a great coach. He was awarded the Naismith Award as Coach of the Year this year, but we also commend him for leading Villanova this year and for the way he conducted himself, even in the aftermath of a win. We learn a lot about people in victory and defeat, whether that is in the athletic contest or even in politics or life itself. I thought Jay Wright showed a lot of class in the way he conducted himself after winning, which is sometimes not the case in sports today. I want to commend them as well for their great teamwork that obviously has to play out not just on the court in one game but over the length of a season--the practice and the hard work and the working together and the way they built each other up. There are so many instances where this team really was a team in reality, not just in terms of people talking about them as a team. I am not sure they could have shot better. I am told--and I hope I have this right--they had a 58-percent shooting field goal percentage throughout the tournament. That is a remarkable achievement. Again, that doesn't just happen; it happens because of hard work and because of a great coach. I want to commend and salute the team and congratulate them on winning a very difficult tournament. This is a tournament that had a lot of upsets and a lot of twists and turns before the team came out No. 1. That is a great achievement. Finally, I commend and salute the university and Father Peter Donahue, the president. We know him as Father Peter. I want to thank him. He sent me a Villanova hat, which I wore during the semifinal game or part of the game. I made sure I wore it at least for a few minutes during the final game. I was grateful he sent me that reminder of team spirit. In addition to Father Peter in the larger Villanova community, we want to salute the students, who were so loyal, and the fans, who may not have been students but who were either graduates of Villanova or just supporters. And of course the alumni made it possible for the team to have the kind of support they have had over many years. Opioid Epidemic and Children's Exposure to Lead Poisoning Mr. President, in my recent travels across Pennsylvania, two issues arose that I know the Presiding Officer and others may have heard about in the time they were away from Washington, and I know there are many others, but I will just mention two that the people of our State are thinking a lot about and are worried about and expect us to take action concerning. No. 1 is the opioid epidemic across the country, which has caused the kind of death and devastation that none of us can even begin to imagine. In Pennsylvania alone, more than 2,700 people died in 2014 as a result of some kind of drug overdose. So this is a major challenge. We made tremendous progress when we passed our bipartisan bill here, the so-called CARA bill. That was a good move and an important step for the Senate. I hope we can follow up on that with the $600 million in funding that local law enforcement and treatment experts and others have asked us for. We need to finish the job in terms of making sure the Senate is taking the right steps on this challenge. The second issue--which I will mention just briefly because we don't have time today to develop it further--is lead poisoning in children. We know what happened in Flint, the horror and the tragedy of Flint, but in a State such as mine, the biggest challenge we have is not necessarily lead from water or in the water systems that would adversely affect children. In our case, because we have a lot of old homes, it is lead paint and the exposure to lead paint and the high lead levels that put children in a precarious situation in the short run but even long term because some of these impacts, if the levels are very high, can be irreversible. We have to make sure we are doing more to protect our children not only in Pennsylvania but across the country in terms of making sure that fewer and fewer children are exposed to high lead levels. I know we will talk more about that. Those are two major challenges that I know confront Pennsylvania and also confront our country. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy and Working Together in the Senate Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as you know, we have been back home in our States for the last couple of weeks or traveling, listening to our constituents. It was great to be back home and to spend some time talking to the people who I work for about the challenges facing our country and what we have been doing in the U.S. Senate to try to address those challenges. While it is always true that people wish there would be more consensus building and more solutions offered, I would say that, by and large, people feel we had a pretty productive 2015 and are hoping we can continue that sort of productivity here in the Senate in 2016, even though this is a Presidential election year. Yesterday was a good example of that productivity. We passed a trademark enforcement piece of legislation basically without--it was unanimous, to the best of my knowledge. All the Senators here in the Chamber voted for it without going through the official procedural hoops that are required in order to process legislation here in the Senate. Previously we passed legislation--recently the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--to deal with the crisis involving opioid or prescription drug painkillers that are being abused around the country, and people are unfortunately falling into that trap, and then the cheap heroin that sometimes is used as a substitute if people can't find the opioid prescription drugs. So Congress actually has been doing the people's business here. Of course, we are in the type of profession where people will sometimes say: Well, we think you are doing a great job. And others will say: Well, we don't think you are doing quite so great a job. But that is the nature of the beast. Either way, it is always good to be back home. As I was talking to my constituents back home, I was glad to hear one thing. No matter what part of the State I was traveling in, there was appreciation for the decision we made to give the voters a voice on who makes the next lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. Texans want to have a say in who replaces Justice Scalia on our Nation's highest Court, and I believe their voice should be heard. We are already engaged in the Presidential primaries process. Today is the Wisconsin primary. It will not be that long before we have a new President who will make that appointment. I simply believe it is important--particularly in something that could extend for the next 25 or 30 years and really affect the balance of power on the Supreme Court--that this be left to the voters. We all know we did not end up in this position overnight. In fact, there is a lot of history. I remember that back when I came to the Senate, I was frustrated by the fact that there was so much politics at play in the judicial confirmation process. Having served as a State court judge for 13 years, I had some pretty strong views about that. But the problem is, there has been a lot that has transpired in the interim. Everything from the Biden rule to the Reid statement in 2005 was really a threat saying that if President George W. Bush were to appoint a judge to the Supreme Court, it was within the authority of the U.S. Senate not to hold a vote on that appointment. That was in 2005. That was the Democratic leader. And then in 2007 when George W. Bush was still President, 18 months before he left office, Senator Schumer, the next Democratic leader, said there should be a presumption against confirmation. This is something that is nearly unprecedented. Then we know that in the interim there has been this development of filibusters or the requirement of 60 votes in order to get judges confirmed brought to us by our [[Page S1654]] Democratic friends, as well as something we didn't think would ever happen but, in fact, did happen under Democratic leadership: the so- called nuclear option--in other words, breaking the Senate rules in order to confirm judges mainly to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--what some call the second most powerful court in the Nation--in order to pack that court with judges who are more likely to affirm President Obama's constitutional overreach. So, as I said, much to my chagrin and I bet to a lot of people's chagrin, we have seen the playbook torn up by our Democratic colleagues and rewritten. The question is, Are we going to be operating under a different set of rules than they would if the roles were reversed? Frankly, my constituents back home think the rules ought to be the same no matter who happens to be in the majority and who happens to be in the White House. Even more significantly, the Supreme Court is the final authority for many of the most pressing issues that face our country. The Court often acts as a constitutional counterweight to the passions of both the legislative and executive branches. We have seen the Supreme Court operate time and time again as a check on the Obama administration's lawless actions. We saw this in the recess-appointment case. We have seen it in a number of different cases where the Court has said to the Obama administration: You have simply overextended your reach beyond legitimate boundaries. I am thankful for that important counterbalance in our government and the give-and-take that the Founding Fathers intended for us to have with three coequal branches of government. But, as I said, the next Supreme Court Justice could well change the ideological direction of the Court for a generation. Rightly or wrongly, the Supreme Court has the final word on issues as varied as the scope of the President's power, the ability of the States to make their own decisions about self-government, and questions of personal liberty and the like. The Court can and has made all the difference in the world, and one Justice can affect that for a long time. We recall Justice Scalia as somebody who believed that the words of the Constitution mattered greatly, and he served on the Court for 30 years. Justice Scalia was what was sometimes called an originalist. In other words, he believed the Court had an obligation to apply the Constitution and the law as written, not based on some substituted value judgment for what perhaps the unelected, lifetime-tenured judges would have preferred in terms of policy. That is not their role. They don't stand for election. It is our role as the policymakers in the political branches who do stand for election--and thus give the American people a chance to voice their pleasure or displeasure, as the case may be, with the direction that we perhaps take the country when it comes to policy. But that is not a role the Supreme Court should play. We need to approach filling this seat with great care. The administration and their liberal allies are now trying to basically throw everything but the kitchen sink at stopping the American people from getting a voice in this matter. In other words, they are trying to force Congress's hand or the Senate's hand to confirm the Presidential nominee at this time. They are spending millions of dollars on TV advertising. They have hired consultants, and they found some sympathetic allies in the media to criticize us. I don't begrudge anybody who has a different point of view than I do about this, but I simply cannot in good conscience vote to confirm another Obama nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court in the waning days of this President's term in office. I happen to believe we should not process this nomination. We should exercise the power we have under the Constitution to grant or withhold consent, and in this case to withhold consent. But here we are, several weeks after the President announced his nominee, and nothing has really changed. All the money and the consultants in the world are not going to change the fact that the American people are going to have their say. We don't know exactly how that will turn out, but that is because this is based not on the personality of the nominee but on the principle that the American people should have their voice heard. As I said, the President has the authority to nominate anybody he chooses, but that doesn't change our responsibility or our authority under that same Constitution. We remain committed to the idea that this vacancy should be filled by the next President. I want to be clear that the American people do deserve a voice here, and we will make sure they are heard. In the meantime, as I started out saying, there are a lot of things we can do working together. Just because we disagree about this one item doesn't mean we have to disagree about everything or that Congress needs to lapse into dysfunction. We currently have a bill pending before us involving the Federal Aviation Administration and the very important topic of safe and secure air travel. We can disagree about how to proceed with the President's nominee to the Supreme Court and still work together to pass other good consensus legislation. So I hope all of us, our colleagues across the aisle and on this side of the aisle, will continue to work together to do things I think would help the country a lot, things such as criminal justice reform--a bill that has been voted out of the Judiciary Committee, that enjoys broad bipartisan support, and that the President of the United States has said he supports. There is also other important legislation that I am very concerned about and interested in involving the intersection of mental illness with our criminal justice system and the fact that our jails have become the de facto warehouses for people with mental illness who are going untreated and obviously the homeless who are living on our streets, many of whom are suffering from mental illness. I hope we can continue to work together on these other consensus matters even though we disagree about this one very important matter. I am confident that we can and we will. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, during the recess last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, President Obama's nominee to fill the existing vacancy of an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. During our meeting, we discussed the role of the Supreme Court and protecting the civil rights of Americans. We discussed a number of national security challenges, including those relating to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We discussed the Citizens United case and campaign finance law. We talked about the respect for each branch of government and our constitutional system of checks and balances. We spoke about the important role of precedent in our judicial decisions and the need to build consensus on decisions. We discussed the value of promoting pro bono work in the legal profession and the need to address the growing access-to-justice gap. I was pleased to hear that as an attorney at the Justice Department, Chief Justice Garland worked to clarify ethics rules to allow government lawyers to engage in additional pro bono work. What I was doing is what I hope every Member in the Senate will do, and that is finding out more about Judge Garland, his judicial philosophy, the way he has conducted his life, his respect for the Constitution and the precedents of the judicial branch of government, looking at current issues and seeing how Judge Garland views those current issues. That is all part of a confirmation process. The President, under the Constitution, has done his job; that is, he has made the nomination of who he believes should fill Justice Scalia's vacancy. It is now up to the Senate to do [[Page S1655]] our job, and our job starts with Members of the Senate meeting with Judge Garland to be able to see one-on-one, without cameras glaring, how Judge Garland responds to our individual issues. We obviously have his record, his background, his public service, what he has done as a lawyer, what he has done as a prosecutor, and what he has done as a judge on the circuit court. We also should have a confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, which will give us more information. Under the Constitution, the responsibility of the President is to make the nomination. It is now up to the Senate to do our job, and our job is to consider that nominee, for each Senator to learn as much as they possibly can--this is a critically important position, obviously, the Supreme Court of the United States--and for the institution to hold hearings and to vote. Each Senator will have to make his or her own judgment on whether we should vote for or against confirmation, but we have a responsibility to consider that nomination and a responsibility to vote. I must say that I was very impressed by the nominee during the course of our meeting. He has impeccable qualifications as a prosecutor, judge, and now chief judge of what many call the second highest court in the land. The Senate confirmed Judge Garland on a bipartisan basis for his current judgeship, which he has held for nearly two decades. Chief Judge Garland strikes me as a thoughtful and deliberate person who has dedicated his life to public service. And I am proud to say that the nominee is a Marylander and lives in Bethesda in Montgomery County, MD. Chief Judge Garland is the nominee for the Supreme Court and should be dealt with in this term of Congress. It is not a matter for the next President and the next Congress; it is a matter for this President and this Congress. There are 9 months left in this year, and to suggest that we don't have the time and the President doesn't have the authority to appoint a nominee is outrageous, and it is an affront to the Constitution. This nomination is not about popularity or politics; it is about finding the next Justice who will advance the rule of law in this country, who will recognize the responsibility of the Supreme Court to be the final arbiter on constitutional issues, and having a person who can bring about greater consensus among his colleagues. As more of my colleagues meet Judge Garland, they will see that this is one of his many strengths. We need to go through the process and give Chief Judge Garland a chance. I think it is hard to understand how you are excused from doing your job for 9 months by not having a confirmation hearing or vote. I don't think the American people understand that. Quite frankly, I don't understand that. I don't understand why we are not going through the regular order. Regular order would be for us individually to meet with Judge Garland and for the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing and to schedule a timely vote on the floor of the Senate. I think more and more Senators will come to that conclusion. The President did his job, and it is now time for the Senate to do its job. The American people want to see nine Justices on the Supreme Court when it convenes its new term in October. We have a new term beginning in October of this year. We expect to see nine Justices on the Court to make decisions. You don't resolve issues on a 4-to-4 vote. We hopefully will have greater consensus. We shouldn't have a divided Court. We should be able to get more collegiality on the Supreme Court, but we also should be able to make a decision. The Supreme Court needs to be able to make a decision. With eight Justices, in too many cases they are not going to be able to make a decision. Article II, section 2, of the Constitution states that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.'' The President has no alternative under the Constitution but to make a nomination when there is a vacancy. There is a vacancy on the Supreme Court due to Justice Scalia's untimely death. The President did his job. The Constitution says very clearly that we--the Senate--have to advise and consent. That is our requirement. That is not optional; we have that as a requirement. Never have we denied an opportunity to consider a Supreme Court nominee. It is now up to us to consider that nominee, and we should consider that nominee by doing our job--interviewing Judge Garland, scheduling a committee hearing, and voting on that nominee. The American people twice elected President Obama to a 4-year term in office. Their voice has been heard very clearly. Elections have consequences, and President Obama has carried out the constitutional responsibilities and duties of his office by nominating Judge Garland as the successor to Justice Scalia. The President is simply doing the job the American people elected him to do. The President doesn't stop working simply because it is an election year. He has more than 9 months left in office, as do Senators who will face the voters in November. Congress should not stop working, either, in this election year. Of course, every Senator has the right to make his or her own judgment on whether they will vote for or against confirmation. Senators were elected for 6-year terms by the citizens of their States and have the right and obligation to vote as they see fit. President Obama was elected by the people of the United States for two 4-year terms and has the right and obligation to nominate judges. History has shown that when the roles were reversed and Democrats held the majority in the Senate, Supreme Court and judicial nominees for Republican Presidents were given hearings and up-or-down votes regardless of when the vacancies occurred. While I might have picked different judges, as a Senator, I voted to confirm the vast majority of President Bush's judicial nominations in his final year in office. I will continue to carry out my constitutional responsibilities that I undertook when I became a Senator and swore to support the Constitution. Let me remind my colleagues that a democratically controlled Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court during the last year of President Ronald Reagan's final term in 1988. Senators also confirmed Justice Murphy in 1940, Justice Cardozo in 1932, and Justice Brandeis in 1916. The precedent of the Senate indicates that we need to take up this nominee. What the Republicans are effectively trying to do is temporarily shrink the Supreme Court from nine to eight Justices and shorten the term of the President from 4 years to 3 years. Why? Because the President is of a different party than the Senate. This is disgraceful and indefensible. Let me quote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 as the first female Justice of the Supreme Court. When asked about the vacancy on the Court created by the death of Justice Scalia, Justice O'Connor said, ``We need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' I agree with Justice O'Connor. Let's do our job and fulfill the Senate's constitutional responsibilities and vote up or down on Judge Garland's nomination. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1648-S1655] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 636, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 55, H.R. 636, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is an old verse that reads, if I remember correctly, as follows: While I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish that man would go away. That man in the U.S. Senate is Merrick Garland, a person whom I am sure the Republican leadership wishes would just go away. But he is not going to go away. Merrick Garland is the nominee whom President Obama has sent forward to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court occasioned by the untimely death of Antonin Scalia. In sending that name forward, President Obama was meeting his constitutional responsibility. Article II, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution states clearly that the President shall--shall-- nominate a person to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. It goes on to say that the responsibility of the Senate is to provide advice and consent to Supreme Court nominations. It is very clear. The men who wrote the Constitution understood the importance of filling a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, and they understood it to be so important that they mandated that the President send the nominee forward to fill that vacancy. You can read that Constitution from start to finish and never find the rationale being used by Senator McConnell, the majority leader of the Senate, to stop that nomination from being considered in the Senate. There is no argument made in the Constitution--nor has there ever been an argument made--that because the President is in the last year of his 4-year term, he no longer has a constitutional responsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. In fact, never-- underline never--has the Senate refused a hearing to a nominee who has been sent forward by a President of the United States to fill this important vacancy. It speaks volumes that Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, has decided--has taken it on himself--to stop the Senate from considering the President's nominee. It is an embarrassing position to take for many of his colleagues. Look at what they are going through. Republican Senators who went home over this Easter break--many of them--went to town meetings where people asked this very basic question: Senator, why is it that you won't do your job? Why won't you even give a hearing to this man who was sent by the President for consideration by the Senate to fill this important vacancy? It is a hard question to answer if you take the position of Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, because the answer is that, basically, he is arguing that this President has no authority--no authority to fill this vacancy. Senator McConnell argues that we should hold this vacancy open for the rest of this calendar year into next year so that a new President--whoever that might be--would have the power to fill this vacancy. He argues that the American people will speak through this next election as to a new President and that person should have the authority. Well, what we discovered over the course of the last several weeks is this isn't about giving the American people a voice in choosing to fill that vacancy; it is about giving two individuals, the Koch brothers, the decision to fill that vacancy. These brothers have decided it is in their best interests--their political interests, their economic interests, whatever it may be--to keep this spot vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in the hopes that a Republican Presidential candidate will win the election and fill the Court vacancy with the blessing of the Koch brothers. So Republican Senators are going back to their home districts and States, basically facing the electorate in their home States, and finding it impossible to justify avoiding any consideration of this nominee. It got more difficult this morning. I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Washington Post be printed in the Record in its entirety. The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland is getting a boost for his Supreme Court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him best--his former law clerks. It goes on to say that 68 former law clerks for this judge have written to Members of Congress recommending him based on their personal experience of working professionally with him. Let me read this passage from their letter: There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland. Our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers. He has stood by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. He has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. He is a constant source of career advice and guidance. And he has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty. This article one might expect from his clerks saying what a good person he is, but they have gone out of their way to suggest to the Senate that a person of this quality and this integrity should be treated fairly--fairly. I listened to some of the comments that are being made on the Republican side about this man, and it is a long way from fairness. What they are saying to him is we don't care about where you came from. We don't care about your education. We don't care about your professional qualifications. We don't care about your career on the bench. We care that you have been nominated by President Barack Obama, and as far as Senator McConnell is concerned, enough said. If Barack Obama nominates this man, Senator McConnell has made it clear he will deny to him something that has never ever been denied to a Supreme Court nominee in the history of the United States of America: a fair hearing. That is why it is painful for a lot of Republican Senators to go back and face audiences. The partisans in the audience come in, in a predictable state, with Republicans saying: Hold the line. Don't let Obama act like a President of the United States. We want him to go away. Democrats come in and ask: Can't you at least give this man a hearing? I would say to my Republican colleagues: Listen to the people who view themselves as Independents in this country, folks who don't carry a party label. They are saying overwhelmingly that Merrick Garland is entitled to a hearing before the U.S. Senate. He is an extraordinarily well-qualified man. There is no credible justification to refuse to give him a hearing. Merrick Garland was born in Chicago. His father ran a small business. His mother volunteered in the Rogers Park neighborhood. He was the grandson of immigrants who fled anti-Semitism in the Pale of Settlement in Russia. They came to America in the early 1900s. Judge Garland grew up in Lincolnwood, IL. He graduated at the top of his class at Niles West High School in Skokie. He earned an undergraduate and law degree from Harvard. He was a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly on the Second Circuit and to Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. He had a distinguished career at the Justice Department. They sent Merrick Garland down after the Oklahoma City tragedy, when there was a terrible incident--a domestic terrorist bombing--that killed and maimed so many people. The prosecution of that accused terrorist was the highest priority for the Department of Justice. They had to get it right, not just for the cause of justice but for the victims and their families. They had to get it right on this prosecution. So they sent their very best prosecutor, Merrick [[Page S1649]] Garland. He was given that responsibility and took it very seriously. He used to carry around with him the names of those who died in that Oklahoma City terrorist incident as a reminder of the solemn responsibility which he carried in this undertaking. That is the kind of person he is. He successfully prosecuted those who were engaged in the terrorism that caused that terrible event. The Department of Justice thought that highly of him, and his performance in Oklahoma City was so stellar that he achieved his goal--a fair and effective prosecution. The Senate considered Merrick Garland for the second highest court of the land, the D.C. Circuit Court in 1997. He received a majority vote on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats. The total final vote was 76 to 23. Thirty-two Senate Republicans voted to confirm Judge Garland. He has been on that court--the D.C. Circuit--for 19 years and he has been the chief judge for the last 3 years. Throughout his lengthy judicial career, Chief Judge Garland has been praised for his intelligence, knowledge of the law, adherence to precedent, and his ability to forge a consensus. Listen to what Chief Justice John Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court said during his own confirmation hearing: ``Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.'' I have my differences with Chief Justice Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court, but I will be the first to say his presentation to the Senate Judiciary Committee was one I will never forget. He sat there for 2 days, without a note in front of him, and answered every question effectively and eloquently. I left there with the distinct impression he was one of the brightest individuals who had ever been nominated to the Supreme Court. So this man, Chief Justice Roberts, whether we agree with his politics or his decisions, should be listened to when he says of Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee, that if you disagreed with Judge Garland, you know you are in a difficult area. That is high praise from Chief Justice John Roberts. It is high praise for a man who has been denied a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time in the history of the Senate. I commend Judge Garland for his many decades of public service and congratulate him and his wife Lynn and their daughters for the great honor they have been given to be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. I offer as well a word of apology to them for the way they are being treated by the U.S. Senate. This is not right. I hope that in the quiet and the solitude of their own Republican caucus lunch, they will close the door and turn to one another and say: This is not fair. It is not right. We owe this man a hearing. I am not saying he should be rubberstamped. I am not saying the Senate Republican majority should approve this man, although I think it is difficult not to. I am saying he should be given a hearing. He deserves that respect from the U.S. Senate. It would be terrible and beneath the dignity of the Senate Republicans to close the doors of the Senate to such an accomplished American and deny him a fair hearing and a vote. The President has met his responsibility. The Senate should do no less. I know Merrick Garland is in for a rough ride. The senior Senator from Texas said as much a few weeks ago. He said President Obama's Supreme Court nominee would ``bear some resemblance to a pinata.'' Do we know what that means? Remember, if you will, that Mexican custom of filling a paper mache animal with candy, then blindfolding a child and giving him a stick or a bat to try to swing wildly and beat on that pinata until it is broken open and the candy hits the floor. That was the analogy used by the senior Senator from Texas as to how Merrick Garland should expect to be treated if his nomination comes before the Senate. It is a sad commentary, but it may reflect the reality of the bitter political environment we live in. It is troubling to hear our nomination process in the Senate characterized this way. There is a way to avoid pinata politics. Let's give Merrick Garland a fair hearing. Right now, conservative groups and some Senate Republicans are taking their swings blindly at Merrick Garland. They are flailing around, hoping to find some argument to justify the mistreatment which they are offering. For example, there is a rightwing advocacy group calling itself the Judicial Crisis Network, whatever that is, that recently announced a multi-State ad campaign against Judge Garland. How about that. They will not give him a hearing. They will not even let him sit down in a chair under oath and face questions and give answers, but they have started a multi-State ad campaign against him. The campaign said that with Garland on the bench, the Second Amendment would be ``gutted'' because ``in two separate cases, Garland has demonstrated his strong hostility to gun owner rights.'' Several Senate Republicans have echoed this attack. They have heard this so-called Judicial Crisis Network ad and they have decided to amplify it. However, there is no argument that can be made seriously or fairly for the proposition that Judge Garland opposes the Second Amendment in his rulings. There are two cases mentioned by this rightwing organization on the subject. They date back many years to 2000 and 2007. The first was a case involving the auditing of background check records. When that case was appealed to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department of President George W. Bush, led by conservative Attorney General John Ashcroft, agreed with Judge Garland's position. There was no controversy as far as they were concerned. So a Republican President and a Republican Attorney General agreed with the ruling of Judge Garland. In the other case in which Judge Garland is accused of having overstepped the bounds on the Second Amendment, he never even addressed any substantive Second Amendment issue. If the Judicial Crisis Network was so outraged by these decisions in the year 2000 and the year 2007, why didn't they bring it up in 2010 when Merrick Garland was in the running to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court? In that year, Carrie Severino, the head of that organization--the Judicial Crisis Network--told the Washington Post: Of those the President could nominate, we can do a lot worse than Merrick Garland. He's the best scenario we could hope for to bring the tension and the politics in the city down a notch for the summer. I just quoted the person who was in charge of the Judicial Crisis Network when Merrick Garland was under consideration for the Supreme Court six years ago. Now that same network has decided to spend millions of dollars to stop this nominee. If Judge Garland's views on the Second Amendment were so objectionable, why has he been praised by Charles Cooper, the gun lobby's top outside attorney? On March 28 of this year, Cooper told the Washington Post about his ``high opinion'' of Garland as a judge. So here is the reality. Rightwing advocacy groups like the Judicial Crisis Network are swinging wildly at Judge Garland. They mischaracterize his record and they attack his judgment in an effort to discredit him. If the Senate holds a public hearing for Garland, he would at least have his day to state his position clearly on the Second Amendment, but they are so afraid of what he is going to say, the Republican leadership in the Senate has denied Merrick Garland an opportunity for a hearing at this point in time. At a hearing, the American people could judge for themselves. How about that for a novel idea; that we would put Merrick Garland under oath, sit him at a table, ask whatever questions we consider to be important for his nomination, and then let the American people decide. The Republicans will have nothing to do with that. Senator McConnell has said from the start he is never going to allow that to occur. The Senate is doing Judge Garland and our Nation a grave disservice if we don't move forward with a public hearing on this nomination, as we have with every other Supreme Court nominee that has been sent by a President. Just for the record, go back to 1987, when a vacancy occurred on the Supreme Court, and in 1988, the last year of Ronald Reagan's Republican Presidency, he sent a nominee to the U.S. Senate to be considered. Anthony Kennedy was a Reagan nominee, and the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate not only gave Anthony Kennedy a hearing, [[Page S1650]] they gave him a unanimous vote, sending him to the Supreme Court. Despite the fact that Ronald Reagan was a ``lameduck''--the last year of his Presidency--the Senate at that time respected the Office of the Presidency and respected the Constitution enough to give Anthony Kennedy his day before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his day before the U.S. Senate. If it was fair enough for a Republican President in a Democratic Senate, why isn't the same standard to be used when it comes to President Obama's nominee being sent to the Senate on this day? It cannot be explained away. What does this vacancy on the Supreme Court mean? There are only eight members of a nine-member Court. Already the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice on 4-to-4 tie votes since Justice Scalia's passing. Almost 50 cases still need to be decided in this term. Major legal questions may go unresolved because the Senate is not doing its job and not filling this vacancy. Judge Garland does not deserve to be used as a pinata--a word used by a Senate Republican describing what he would face in the Senate. Let's give him an opportunity to rebut any attacks made against him. Let him explain himself on the record in full view of the American public. Let the American people decide if the ads and attacks against him are valid or baseless. I urge my Republican colleagues: Do not follow the lead of rightwing advocacy groups and attack Judge Garland's character or record when you refuse to give the man a chance to respond at a public hearing. That is fundamentally unfair. This is a real moment of truth for the Senate. No Supreme Court nominee has ever been denied a hearing before, and Merrick Garland should not be the first. The message of the American people to the Senate Republican majority is very simple, three words: Do your job. Do your job under the Constitution. Have a hearing. Be fair to this man. Don't dream up excuses. Don't argue with this President who won by 5 million votes over Mitt Romney. Don't disrespect the Office of the Presidency or the Constitution, which in its clarity establishes our responsibility to give a hearing to this nominee. My Republican colleagues need to do their job and to schedule a hearing for Merrick Garland without delay. Mr. President, I yield the floor. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Garland's Ex-Clerks: Confirm Our Old Boss (By Mike DeBonis) U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland is getting a boost for his Supreme Court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him best: his former law clerks. Sixty-eight former Garland clerks signed a letter delivered Monday to Senate leaders of both parties, urging them to confirm his nomination. The signers comprise all but three of the ex-clerks Garland has employed since he joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1997. And the three holdouts have a good reason: They are clerks for Supreme Court justices. The three-page tribute is both professional and personal. ``There are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward Chief Judge Garland,'' the ex-clerks write. ``Our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers. He has stood by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. He has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. He is a constant source of career advice and guidance. And he has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty.'' Clerkships on the D.C. Circuit are among the nation's most prestigious, second only to the Supreme Court itself. The signers have gone on to high-level positions in federal and state government, private practices and academia. Several have spent time in the office of the White House counsel; one of those lawyers, Danielle Gray, served as Cabinet secretary to President Obama. The letter paints a familiar portrait of Garland as a careful judge, a hard-working public servant and a devoted family man. But it also offers a couple of glimpses behind the curtain. In one notable passage, the clerks write that Garland ``taught us the value of diversity, in all its forms.'' ``We observed how Chief Judge Garland forged meaningful connections with others from a wide array of backgrounds and ideological perspectives--from the law clerks he hires to the personal and professional relationships he maintains. He finds camaraderie with his fellow judges without regard to who nominated them to the bench. Chief Judge Garland deeply believes that our system of justice works best when those who see things differently are able to work together, in a collegial manner, to arrive at a just result. And when he must disagree with his colleagues, he always does so respectfully.'' And they describe how his private response to the Sept 11, 2001, attacks had a profound impression on the four clerks who were working for him at the time: ``From his chambers, we watched with horror the news about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the days after, we remember the explicit importance Chief Judge Garland placed on coming to the office everyday and continuing to prepare for upcoming cases. In the aftermath of that terrible tragedy, he believed it was more important than ever for the American people to see that their system of government was functioning without interruption--that the rule of law endured!'' Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to join in the remarks just made by the senior Senator from Illinois that we have an obligation to do our job and to provide a hearing and a vote for the President's nominee--not as a matter of discretion or convenience but as a mandatory obligation we have as Members of this body. It is an obligation that comes from the Constitution, which says that we shall exercise this duty of advising and consenting. For all the reasons my colleague has expressed so eloquently, the American people feel that it is our job, and they are right. Nothing so epitomizes the feeling of the American people that Washington is failing to work, that this body is failing to do its job, that the Congress and the Federal Government are failing the American people, than the failure to deal with this nominee. The refusal to even meet with him mocks the American system of justice. For all who care about the quality of our judicial nominee, this intransigence is both an insult and an injury, and it will do lasting damage to the Court if it drags this third branch of government into the mire of partisan bickering. The judicial branch depends, for the enforceability of its decisions, on the trust and credibility of the American people that it is above politics and that decisions made by the judicial branch are on the merits without regard to the special interests and the money that so infects this branch, and they are entitled to our support for the credibility and trust of the judicial branch, and nothing epitomizes the need for that credibility and trust more than the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the highest Court in the land, and it is the most powerful. It is an anomaly in a democratic government because it is unelected, appointed for life, at the top of the judicial pyramid, exercising vast powers, with only the trust and credibility of the American people as its means of enforcement. It has no army or police of its own. Its decisions and enforceability depend for their effect on it being above politics. The controversy and the intransigence and refusal to even consider this nominee is a great threat to that institution. Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act Mr. President, on the issue of getting the job done, I want to go to a separate topic very much on our minds at this time of year, very distinct and different, but I want to join it in these remarks because it is timely as we begin the next phase of our bipartisan efforts to combat Lyme and tick-borne diseases. We will be building support this week for a bill that has been introduced by Senator Ayotte and me, with the strong involvement and leadership of Senator Gillibrand, S. 1503, the Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act, with 13 cosponsors. It is a bipartisan bill that is critically important to public health. Today we will be welcoming a number of my friends and constituents from Connecticut and around the country who are experts to provide briefings [[Page S1651]] to our staffs in sessions that have been organized by Senator Ayotte, Senator Gillibrand, and me. We are very pleased to welcome some of the leaders of this effort: John Aucott, who is an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; Dr. Brian Fallon, a good friend and leading expert in this area and a professor at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; Ally Hilfiger, who has been a survivor and strong supporter and advocate; Rebecca Tibball, a fourth grade teacher from my home State of Connecticut who has been battling Lyme disease since August of 2014; and David Roth, also a leader and a longstanding patient advocate from New York who in his day job is a managing director at the private sector group Blackstone. These individuals are here to call attention to and build support for curing a disease that is literally exploding exponentially in this country and now constitutes an epidemic that literally impinges and cripples the lives of millions of Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that more than 36,000 Americans suffered from Lyme disease in 2013. It says that the number who actually contracted this disease is probably 10 times higher because it is undetected and undiagnosed in so many people and it is underreported even when it is discovered in individuals. Most of the cases of Lyme disease occur in a limited number of States. Ninety- eight percent of them occur in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. I name those States because the Senators in those States ought to be behind this bill, every single one of them. But those cases are only the ones reported. In many States there is no systematic reporting of Lyme disease, so the full extent, breadth, and depth of this epidemic is truly unknown. We know in this body how to respond and recognize a public health threat. It was done for Ebola. It is done for influenza. It hopefully will be done for Zika. What is needed is the same kind of bipartisan awareness and support for legislation to help people who suffer from Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Sometimes this Senator is asked: Why has the Congress failed to recognize and respond to this severe public health threat? There is no good explanation except for the underreporting and the unawareness, and that is no excuse. In the meantime, the cases of Lyme disease are exploding in number, and the severity impacts our economy as well as the quality of life for Americans. It affects people's ability to perform their jobs, children's ability to go to school, and families' ability to function normally. The disease, if undetected and untreated, can cause the most severe kinds of pain and disability. Lyme disease is named after a town in my State. I have always felt it was tremendously unfair for the beautiful and wonderful town of Lyme to have its name bear the burden of this disease, but regardless of the name, the burden is on the entire country--not simply on Connecticut and not simply on the Northeast or any part of the country or profession--to take action. That action must include provisions in this bill to strengthen Lyme disease surveillance and reporting, an education program, establishing epidemiological research objectives for tick-borne diseases, and the preparation of a regular report to Congress on the progress of efforts to combat these devastating tick- borne diseases. The effects are devastating, pernicious, and insidious, creeping into every aspect of a victim's life. Our bill has earned the support of 13 Senators from both parties, including five members of the HELP Committee. When it comes to fighting Lyme disease, there is no partisanship. The ticks that carry this disease don't know a red State from a blue one. They don't make any discrimination between the boundaries of different States. The devastating diseases that can spring from these ticks are common to our entire country and therefore demand a national response and a Federal program that we have outlined in this bill. I am proud to join with Senator Ayotte and Senator Gillibrand in this effort. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to send your staffs to the briefing we have today. I thank others from Connecticut--such as Alexandra Cohen--who are going to be coming today, and I look forward to continuing this fight, which has to be one of a nationwide commitment. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from South Dakota. ISIS Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to address last month's tragic terror attacks in Brussels and Istanbul by ISIS. It is critical for the Senate to consider these significant events as we get back to work on bills enhancing security and setting policies for air transportation. In Brussels, 35 innocent people, including four Americans, lost their lives in barbaric attacks by ISIS at a subway station and airport terminal. In Istanbul, an ISIS suicide bombing killed four on Central Street and left dozens more injured. My thoughts and prayers are with those injured, the families of the victims, and the citizens of Belgium and Turkey. In the past 2 years, ISIS has orchestrated 29 attacks on Western targets around the world, killing more than 650 innocent people. A decade ago, the group of violent jihadists behind ISIS fit a fairly conventional definition of a terrorist group. Operating in Iraq, they endeavored to kill Americans, Iraqis, and others working to build a free and democratic nation. Today, however, calling ISIS a mere terrorist group may not fully convey the seriousness of the problem. ISIS, or the so-called Islamic State, has taken control of a significant amount of territory in Iraq and Syria. Within this territory, ISIS has established a self- proclaimed capital city and effective sovereignty over other populated urban centers. It collects taxes, operates and profits from oil well operations, controls banking, and rules over substantial agricultural acreage. These operations help fund and sustain not only ISIS armed fighters but also the group's attempt to build actual institutions that spread its message of hate. Unfortunately, ISIS has enjoyed considerable success communicating and spreading its distorted vision of a grand Islamic caliphate claiming authority over all Muslims. Branches of ISIS, trying to replicate what has happened in Syria and Iraq, have taken root elsewhere and carried out operations in destabilized areas, including Libya, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, and Yemen. A recent report estimated that as many as 31,000 ISIS adherents have traveled from 86 countries to join the organization in Iraq and Syria. More than 5,000 of these recruits have come from Western Europe and 150 from the United States. In addition to those Americans who have actually traveled abroad, researchers at George Washington University estimated in December that there are 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers here in the United States. Let me repeat that--900 investigations of ISIS sympathizers here in the United States. This doesn't included those who have been radicalized without noticeable warning, such as a couple in San Bernardino who weren't known to authorities before they killed 14 in a shooting attack last December. Over the past few years, ISIS's reach has expanded dramatically, and claims that our current policies have contained the organizations and its dangerous message are both false and reckless. We have had some successes in targeting senior ISIS officials, but as we saw in Brussels, in San Bernardino, and elsewhere, those efforts have not lessened the threat posed by a terrorist state that is successfully propagating its ideology all over the world. So what can we do to protect against the threat posed by ISIS? Here are a few things: First, we need a President who is committed to forming a robust coalition to destroy ISIS abroad. Real American leadership against ISIS must be manifested in sustained engagement against the enemy. We need an administration intent on eliminating the group's sources of income and its control of territory which facilitates an illusion of legitimacy for its followers. Incremental progress is not enough. Indeed, the Washington Post reported last week that some terrorism experts believe pressure on the group's finances [[Page S1652]] could make ISIS more dangerous and unpredictable until it is defeated. Second, we need to control our borders. We need to know who is coming in and out of our country and why. This includes screening travelers for ties to ISIS and to its sympathizers. One of the greatest threats facing Europe is citizens who leave their homes to fight for ISIS and then return to recruit or conduct operations in their communities. We also face this threat from European ISIS fighters, the return of American citizens who have fought for ISIS, and agents of ISIS posing as war refugees. Although we have passed bipartisan legislation to tighten some screening requirements, we need the administration to enforce the law rather than attempt to undermine and work around it. Third, as a final line of defense, we need to better secure the homeland. We must make sure the intelligence community, law enforcement, and Homeland Security officials have the tools they need to deter attacks and to stop plots before they are launched. This includes the need for constant reassessment of our vulnerabilities so we stay ahead of threats. Tomorrow I will chair a hearing at the Commerce Committee with Transportation Security Administration Administrator Peter Neffenger, who happened to be in Brussels during the March 22 attacks. While we mainly see and know the Transportation Security Administration or TSA as the agency behind airport screening of passengers and baggage, the organization actually has a much broader charge. TSA is the designated Federal agency for all transportation security matters. As we know from independent covert testing that exposed TSA failures a year ago, TSA still has work to do to improve screening at airports, but TSA also needs to focus on securing transportation by train, bus, pipelines, and through our ports. The diversity of the targets ISIS selected in its most recent attacks--a subway station, an unsecured airport terminal, and a busy street, underscores the challenge of protecting our citizens from an enemy seeking the path of least resistance to maximize its carnage. To stay ahead of this danger, security officials at TSA and other agencies need to be looking at potential threats before ISIS does. Congress has a role in helping security officials stay ahead of ISIS. Aided by congressional oversight and congressional watchdogs, the Commerce Committee has already approved bipartisan legislation that Senator Bill Nelson and I have offered to address airport security vulnerabilities. Our bill is cosponsored by the Homeland Security Committee's chair and ranking member, Senator Johnson and Senator Carper. Among other provisions, our legislation improves the vetting process for airport workers seeking or holding a security credential that grants access to restricted sections of an airport. Over the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers have been caught in the act helping criminal organizations. On March 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine after she was confronted by airport security officials in California. In Florida, on March 26, an airline gate agent was arrested with a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an associate. According to press reports, the agent told authorities the money was connected to illegal activity, but he knew few other details. Some of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in Brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals--but not terrorists. As we work to address concerns about an insider threat scenario, where an aviation worker helps terrorists, criminals who have broken laws for their own financial gain and those with histories of violence are a good place to start. Ensuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that ISIS in October killed 224 on a Russian flight leaving Egypt. Many experts believe this attack had help from an aviation employee. In S. 2361, the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act, Senator Nelson and I propose not only tightening vetting procedures for workers who need a security credential, but we also expand the list of criminal convictions that disqualifies an applicant from holding one. At present, even applicants convicted for embezzlement, racketeering, perjury, robbery, sabotage, immigration law violations, and assault with a deadly weapon can still obtain an airport security badge granting access to restricted areas. Our bill closes this loophole while updating airport security rules, expanding random inspections of airport workers, and requiring the review of airport perimeter security. The Commerce Committee has also approved another TSA-related bill, H.R. 2843, the TSA PreCheck Expansion Act. This bill would expand participation in the TSA precheck application program by developing private sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. As a result, more passengers would be vetted before they even arrived at the airport and received expedited screening. This would get passengers through security checkpoints more quickly to ensure they don't pose the kind of easy target that ISIS suicide bombers found at the Brussels Airport. Historically, this body has passed aviation security enhancements separate from a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. While I still prefer this separate approach and believe the Senate should pass our consensus security legislation without delay, I will pursue every option to enact these improvements and will vigorously oppose any effort to water down any security efforts that passed the Commerce Committee. As we look at ISIS and consider necessary steps to stop attacks, let's remember our recent history of fighting terrorism. In the 1990s, our Nation not only fell behind on intelligence and airport security, but we did not act with force against Al Qaeda's enclaves in Afghanistan. This was true even after we recognized a significant threat following attacks on our embassies in East Africa and on the USS Cole in Yemen. Only after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon did our Nation pursue a strong military response and adopt significant reforms to enhance our Homeland Security. Like Al Qaeda, ISIS is now a significant danger. While we are doing more to push our Homeland Security and intelligence agencies to meet current and future threats, we are unwise to allow this enemy time and multiple chances to inflict mass casualties. As a legislative body, we have already passed legislation closing a border security vulnerability in our Visa Waiver Program and have an opportunity in the bill that Senator Nelson and I have offered to guard against an insider threat at airports. As lawmakers, we are going in the right direction. However, our responsibility to the people we represent does not end there. Until this administration or its successor changes the facts on the ground, we also have an obligation to speak about the continued threat of ISIS, especially when the administration downplays the need for a more aggressive response. We have an obligation to continue discussing the genocide of Christians and other religious groups in areas under ISIS control, and we have an obligation to scrutinize Executive actions and conduct rigorous oversight of administration initiatives that pose risks to our homeland. If we can't do this, we have learned very little. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Congratulating the Villanova Wildcats on winning the 2016 NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes on the floor to send congratulations on my own behalf and also on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania to the Villanova Wildcats for a great win last night in the NCAA final. It was a remarkable game for a lot of reasons. My wife and I watched every minute of it, as I know so many did. It was a remarkable game even before the last-second shot, but even more so after the shot made by Kris Jenkins. We are grateful, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, to commend and salute Villanova University and, of course, the team itself. [[Page S1653]] In particular, I commend the players, not only Kris Jenkins but the entire team. At the same time, we commend the work done by Jay Wright. He is a great coach. He was awarded the Naismith Award as Coach of the Year this year, but we also commend him for leading Villanova this year and for the way he conducted himself, even in the aftermath of a win. We learn a lot about people in victory and defeat, whether that is in the athletic contest or even in politics or life itself. I thought Jay Wright showed a lot of class in the way he conducted himself after winning, which is sometimes not the case in sports today. I want to commend them as well for their great teamwork that obviously has to play out not just on the court in one game but over the length of a season--the practice and the hard work and the working together and the way they built each other up. There are so many instances where this team really was a team in reality, not just in terms of people talking about them as a team. I am not sure they could have shot better. I am told--and I hope I have this right--they had a 58-percent shooting field goal percentage throughout the tournament. That is a remarkable achievement. Again, that doesn't just happen; it happens because of hard work and because of a great coach. I want to commend and salute the team and congratulate them on winning a very difficult tournament. This is a tournament that had a lot of upsets and a lot of twists and turns before the team came out No. 1. That is a great achievement. Finally, I commend and salute the university and Father Peter Donahue, the president. We know him as Father Peter. I want to thank him. He sent me a Villanova hat, which I wore during the semifinal game or part of the game. I made sure I wore it at least for a few minutes during the final game. I was grateful he sent me that reminder of team spirit. In addition to Father Peter in the larger Villanova community, we want to salute the students, who were so loyal, and the fans, who may not have been students but who were either graduates of Villanova or just supporters. And of course the alumni made it possible for the team to have the kind of support they have had over many years. Opioid Epidemic and Children's Exposure to Lead Poisoning Mr. President, in my recent travels across Pennsylvania, two issues arose that I know the Presiding Officer and others may have heard about in the time they were away from Washington, and I know there are many others, but I will just mention two that the people of our State are thinking a lot about and are worried about and expect us to take action concerning. No. 1 is the opioid epidemic across the country, which has caused the kind of death and devastation that none of us can even begin to imagine. In Pennsylvania alone, more than 2,700 people died in 2014 as a result of some kind of drug overdose. So this is a major challenge. We made tremendous progress when we passed our bipartisan bill here, the so-called CARA bill. That was a good move and an important step for the Senate. I hope we can follow up on that with the $600 million in funding that local law enforcement and treatment experts and others have asked us for. We need to finish the job in terms of making sure the Senate is taking the right steps on this challenge. The second issue--which I will mention just briefly because we don't have time today to develop it further--is lead poisoning in children. We know what happened in Flint, the horror and the tragedy of Flint, but in a State such as mine, the biggest challenge we have is not necessarily lead from water or in the water systems that would adversely affect children. In our case, because we have a lot of old homes, it is lead paint and the exposure to lead paint and the high lead levels that put children in a precarious situation in the short run but even long term because some of these impacts, if the levels are very high, can be irreversible. We have to make sure we are doing more to protect our children not only in Pennsylvania but across the country in terms of making sure that fewer and fewer children are exposed to high lead levels. I know we will talk more about that. Those are two major challenges that I know confront Pennsylvania and also confront our country. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy and Working Together in the Senate Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as you know, we have been back home in our States for the last couple of weeks or traveling, listening to our constituents. It was great to be back home and to spend some time talking to the people who I work for about the challenges facing our country and what we have been doing in the U.S. Senate to try to address those challenges. While it is always true that people wish there would be more consensus building and more solutions offered, I would say that, by and large, people feel we had a pretty productive 2015 and are hoping we can continue that sort of productivity here in the Senate in 2016, even though this is a Presidential election year. Yesterday was a good example of that productivity. We passed a trademark enforcement piece of legislation basically without--it was unanimous, to the best of my knowledge. All the Senators here in the Chamber voted for it without going through the official procedural hoops that are required in order to process legislation here in the Senate. Previously we passed legislation--recently the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--to deal with the crisis involving opioid or prescription drug painkillers that are being abused around the country, and people are unfortunately falling into that trap, and then the cheap heroin that sometimes is used as a substitute if people can't find the opioid prescription drugs. So Congress actually has been doing the people's business here. Of course, we are in the type of profession where people will sometimes say: Well, we think you are doing a great job. And others will say: Well, we don't think you are doing quite so great a job. But that is the nature of the beast. Either way, it is always good to be back home. As I was talking to my constituents back home, I was glad to hear one thing. No matter what part of the State I was traveling in, there was appreciation for the decision we made to give the voters a voice on who makes the next lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. Texans want to have a say in who replaces Justice Scalia on our Nation's highest Court, and I believe their voice should be heard. We are already engaged in the Presidential primaries process. Today is the Wisconsin primary. It will not be that long before we have a new President who will make that appointment. I simply believe it is important--particularly in something that could extend for the next 25 or 30 years and really affect the balance of power on the Supreme Court--that this be left to the voters. We all know we did not end up in this position overnight. In fact, there is a lot of history. I remember that back when I came to the Senate, I was frustrated by the fact that there was so much politics at play in the judicial confirmation process. Having served as a State court judge for 13 years, I had some pretty strong views about that. But the problem is, there has been a lot that has transpired in the interim. Everything from the Biden rule to the Reid statement in 2005 was really a threat saying that if President George W. Bush were to appoint a judge to the Supreme Court, it was within the authority of the U.S. Senate not to hold a vote on that appointment. That was in 2005. That was the Democratic leader. And then in 2007 when George W. Bush was still President, 18 months before he left office, Senator Schumer, the next Democratic leader, said there should be a presumption against confirmation. This is something that is nearly unprecedented. Then we know that in the interim there has been this development of filibusters or the requirement of 60 votes in order to get judges confirmed brought to us by our [[Page S1654]] Democratic friends, as well as something we didn't think would ever happen but, in fact, did happen under Democratic leadership: the so- called nuclear option--in other words, breaking the Senate rules in order to confirm judges mainly to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals--what some call the second most powerful court in the Nation--in order to pack that court with judges who are more likely to affirm President Obama's constitutional overreach. So, as I said, much to my chagrin and I bet to a lot of people's chagrin, we have seen the playbook torn up by our Democratic colleagues and rewritten. The question is, Are we going to be operating under a different set of rules than they would if the roles were reversed? Frankly, my constituents back home think the rules ought to be the same no matter who happens to be in the majority and who happens to be in the White House. Even more significantly, the Supreme Court is the final authority for many of the most pressing issues that face our country. The Court often acts as a constitutional counterweight to the passions of both the legislative and executive branches. We have seen the Supreme Court operate time and time again as a check on the Obama administration's lawless actions. We saw this in the recess-appointment case. We have seen it in a number of different cases where the Court has said to the Obama administration: You have simply overextended your reach beyond legitimate boundaries. I am thankful for that important counterbalance in our government and the give-and-take that the Founding Fathers intended for us to have with three coequal branches of government. But, as I said, the next Supreme Court Justice could well change the ideological direction of the Court for a generation. Rightly or wrongly, the Supreme Court has the final word on issues as varied as the scope of the President's power, the ability of the States to make their own decisions about self-government, and questions of personal liberty and the like. The Court can and has made all the difference in the world, and one Justice can affect that for a long time. We recall Justice Scalia as somebody who believed that the words of the Constitution mattered greatly, and he served on the Court for 30 years. Justice Scalia was what was sometimes called an originalist. In other words, he believed the Court had an obligation to apply the Constitution and the law as written, not based on some substituted value judgment for what perhaps the unelected, lifetime-tenured judges would have preferred in terms of policy. That is not their role. They don't stand for election. It is our role as the policymakers in the political branches who do stand for election--and thus give the American people a chance to voice their pleasure or displeasure, as the case may be, with the direction that we perhaps take the country when it comes to policy. But that is not a role the Supreme Court should play. We need to approach filling this seat with great care. The administration and their liberal allies are now trying to basically throw everything but the kitchen sink at stopping the American people from getting a voice in this matter. In other words, they are trying to force Congress's hand or the Senate's hand to confirm the Presidential nominee at this time. They are spending millions of dollars on TV advertising. They have hired consultants, and they found some sympathetic allies in the media to criticize us. I don't begrudge anybody who has a different point of view than I do about this, but I simply cannot in good conscience vote to confirm another Obama nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court in the waning days of this President's term in office. I happen to believe we should not process this nomination. We should exercise the power we have under the Constitution to grant or withhold consent, and in this case to withhold consent. But here we are, several weeks after the President announced his nominee, and nothing has really changed. All the money and the consultants in the world are not going to change the fact that the American people are going to have their say. We don't know exactly how that will turn out, but that is because this is based not on the personality of the nominee but on the principle that the American people should have their voice heard. As I said, the President has the authority to nominate anybody he chooses, but that doesn't change our responsibility or our authority under that same Constitution. We remain committed to the idea that this vacancy should be filled by the next President. I want to be clear that the American people do deserve a voice here, and we will make sure they are heard. In the meantime, as I started out saying, there are a lot of things we can do working together. Just because we disagree about this one item doesn't mean we have to disagree about everything or that Congress needs to lapse into dysfunction. We currently have a bill pending before us involving the Federal Aviation Administration and the very important topic of safe and secure air travel. We can disagree about how to proceed with the President's nominee to the Supreme Court and still work together to pass other good consensus legislation. So I hope all of us, our colleagues across the aisle and on this side of the aisle, will continue to work together to do things I think would help the country a lot, things such as criminal justice reform--a bill that has been voted out of the Judiciary Committee, that enjoys broad bipartisan support, and that the President of the United States has said he supports. There is also other important legislation that I am very concerned about and interested in involving the intersection of mental illness with our criminal justice system and the fact that our jails have become the de facto warehouses for people with mental illness who are going untreated and obviously the homeless who are living on our streets, many of whom are suffering from mental illness. I hope we can continue to work together on these other consensus matters even though we disagree about this one very important matter. I am confident that we can and we will. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nomination of Merrick Garland Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, during the recess last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, President Obama's nominee to fill the existing vacancy of an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. During our meeting, we discussed the role of the Supreme Court and protecting the civil rights of Americans. We discussed a number of national security challenges, including those relating to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We discussed the Citizens United case and campaign finance law. We talked about the respect for each branch of government and our constitutional system of checks and balances. We spoke about the important role of precedent in our judicial decisions and the need to build consensus on decisions. We discussed the value of promoting pro bono work in the legal profession and the need to address the growing access-to-justice gap. I was pleased to hear that as an attorney at the Justice Department, Chief Justice Garland worked to clarify ethics rules to allow government lawyers to engage in additional pro bono work. What I was doing is what I hope every Member in the Senate will do, and that is finding out more about Judge Garland, his judicial philosophy, the way he has conducted his life, his respect for the Constitution and the precedents of the judicial branch of government, looking at current issues and seeing how Judge Garland views those current issues. That is all part of a confirmation process. The President, under the Constitution, has done his job; that is, he has made the nomination of who he believes should fill Justice Scalia's vacancy. It is now up to the Senate to do [[Page S1655]] our job, and our job starts with Members of the Senate meeting with Judge Garland to be able to see one-on-one, without cameras glaring, how Judge Garland responds to our individual issues. We obviously have his record, his background, his public service, what he has done as a lawyer, what he has done as a prosecutor, and what he has done as a judge on the circuit court. We also should have a confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, which will give us more information. Under the Constitution, the responsibility of the President is to make the nomination. It is now up to the Senate to do our job, and our job is to consider that nominee, for each Senator to learn as much as they possibly can--this is a critically important position, obviously, the Supreme Court of the United States--and for the institution to hold hearings and to vote. Each Senator will have to make his or her own judgment on whether we should vote for or against confirmation, but we have a responsibility to consider that nomination and a responsibility to vote. I must say that I was very impressed by the nominee during the course of our meeting. He has impeccable qualifications as a prosecutor, judge, and now chief judge of what many call the second highest court in the land. The Senate confirmed Judge Garland on a bipartisan basis for his current judgeship, which he has held for nearly two decades. Chief Judge Garland strikes me as a thoughtful and deliberate person who has dedicated his life to public service. And I am proud to say that the nominee is a Marylander and lives in Bethesda in Montgomery County, MD. Chief Judge Garland is the nominee for the Supreme Court and should be dealt with in this term of Congress. It is not a matter for the next President and the next Congress; it is a matter for this President and this Congress. There are 9 months left in this year, and to suggest that we don't have the time and the President doesn't have the authority to appoint a nominee is outrageous, and it is an affront to the Constitution. This nomination is not about popularity or politics; it is about finding the next Justice who will advance the rule of law in this country, who will recognize the responsibility of the Supreme Court to be the final arbiter on constitutional issues, and having a person who can bring about greater consensus among his colleagues. As more of my colleagues meet Judge Garland, they will see that this is one of his many strengths. We need to go through the process and give Chief Judge Garland a chance. I think it is hard to understand how you are excused from doing your job for 9 months by not having a confirmation hearing or vote. I don't think the American people understand that. Quite frankly, I don't understand that. I don't understand why we are not going through the regular order. Regular order would be for us individually to meet with Judge Garland and for the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing and to schedule a timely vote on the floor of the Senate. I think more and more Senators will come to that conclusion. The President did his job, and it is now time for the Senate to do its job. The American people want to see nine Justices on the Supreme Court when it convenes its new term in October. We have a new term beginning in October of this year. We expect to see nine Justices on the Court to make decisions. You don't resolve issues on a 4-to-4 vote. We hopefully will have greater consensus. We shouldn't have a divided Court. We should be able to get more collegiality on the Supreme Court, but we also should be able to make a decision. The Supreme Court needs to be able to make a decision. With eight Justices, in too many cases they are not going to be able to make a decision. Article II, section 2, of the Constitution states that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.'' The President has no alternative under the Constitution but to make a nomination when there is a vacancy. There is a vacancy on the Supreme Court due to Justice Scalia's untimely death. The President did his job. The Constitution says very clearly that we--the Senate--have to advise and consent. That is our requirement. That is not optional; we have that as a requirement. Never have we denied an opportunity to consider a Supreme Court nominee. It is now up to us to consider that nominee, and we should consider that nominee by doing our job--interviewing Judge Garland, scheduling a committee hearing, and voting on that nominee. The American people twice elected President Obama to a 4-year term in office. Their voice has been heard very clearly. Elections have consequences, and President Obama has carried out the constitutional responsibilities and duties of his office by nominating Judge Garland as the successor to Justice Scalia. The President is simply doing the job the American people elected him to do. The President doesn't stop working simply because it is an election year. He has more than 9 months left in office, as do Senators who will face the voters in November. Congress should not stop working, either, in this election year. Of course, every Senator has the right to make his or her own judgment on whether they will vote for or against confirmation. Senators were elected for 6-year terms by the citizens of their States and have the right and obligation to vote as they see fit. President Obama was elected by the people of the United States for two 4-year terms and has the right and obligation to nominate judges. History has shown that when the roles were reversed and Democrats held the majority in the Senate, Supreme Court and judicial nominees for Republican Presidents were given hearings and up-or-down votes regardless of when the vacancies occurred. While I might have picked different judges, as a Senator, I voted to confirm the vast majority of President Bush's judicial nominations in his final year in office. I will continue to carry out my constitutional responsibilities that I undertook when I became a Senator and swore to support the Constitution. Let me remind my colleagues that a democratically controlled Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court during the last year of President Ronald Reagan's final term in 1988. Senators also confirmed Justice Murphy in 1940, Justice Cardozo in 1932, and Justice Brandeis in 1916. The precedent of the Senate indicates that we need to take up this nominee. What the Republicans are effectively trying to do is temporarily shrink the Supreme Court from nine to eight Justices and shorten the term of the President from 4 years to 3 years. Why? Because the President is of a different party than the Senate. This is disgraceful and indefensible. Let me quote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 as the first female Justice of the Supreme Court. When asked about the vacancy on the Court created by the death of Justice Scalia, Justice O'Connor said, ``We need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' I agree with Justice O'Connor. Let's do our job and fulfill the Senate's constitutional responsibilities and vote up or down on Judge Garland's nomination. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_158.csv,67063,67063,67130,"[congressional record volume 162, number 51 (tuesday, april 5, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1648-s1655] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] america's small business tax relief act of 2015--motion to proceed the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to h.r. 636, which the clerk will report. the bill clerk read as follows: motion to proceed to calendar no. 55, h.r. 636, to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. the presiding officer. the assistant democratic leader. nomination of merrick garland mr. durbin. mr. president, there is an old verse that reads, if i remember correctly, as follows: while i was going up the stair, i met a man who wasn't there. he wasn't there again today. i wish that man would go away. that man in the u.s. senate is merrick garland, a person whom i am sure the republican leadership wishes would just go away. but he is not going to go away. merrick garland is the nominee whom president obama has sent forward to fill the vacancy on the supreme court occasioned by the untimely death of antonin scalia. in sending that name forward, president obama was meeting his constitutional responsibility. article ii, section 2 of the u.s. constitution states clearly that the president shall--shall-- nominate a person to fill a vacancy on the u.s. supreme court. it goes on to say that the responsibility of the senate is to provide advice and consent to supreme court nominations. it is very clear. the men who wrote the constitution understood the importance of filling a vacancy on the u.s. supreme court, and they understood it to be so important that they mandated that the president send the nominee forward to fill that vacancy. you can read that constitution from start to finish and never find the rationale being used by senator mcconnell, the majority leader of the senate, to stop that nomination from being considered in the senate. there is no argument made in the constitution--nor has there ever been an argument made--that because the president is in the last year of his 4-year term, he no longer has a constitutional responsibility to fill a vacancy on the supreme court. in fact, never-- underline never--has the senate refused a hearing to a nominee who has been sent forward by a president of the united states to fill this important vacancy. it speaks volumes that senator mcconnell, the republican leader, has decided--has taken it on himself--to stop the senate from considering the president's nominee. it is an embarrassing position to take for many of his colleagues. look at what they are going through. republican senators who went home over this easter break--many of them--went to town meetings where people asked this very basic question: senator, why is it that you won't do your job? why won't you even give a hearing to this man who was sent by the president for consideration by the senate to fill this important vacancy? it is a hard question to answer if you take the position of senator mcconnell, the republican leader, because the answer is that, basically, he is arguing that this president has no authority--no authority to fill this vacancy. senator mcconnell argues that we should hold this vacancy open for the rest of this calendar year into next year so that a new president--whoever that might be--would have the power to fill this vacancy. he argues that the american people will speak through this next election as to a new president and that person should have the authority. well, what we discovered over the course of the last several weeks is this isn't about giving the american people a voice in choosing to fill that vacancy; it is about giving two individuals, the koch brothers, the decision to fill that vacancy. these brothers have decided it is in their best interests--their political interests, their economic interests, whatever it may be--to keep this spot vacant on the u.s. supreme court in the hopes that a republican presidential candidate will win the election and fill the court vacancy with the blessing of the koch brothers. so republican senators are going back to their home districts and states, basically facing the electorate in their home states, and finding it impossible to justify avoiding any consideration of this nominee. it got more difficult this morning. i ask unanimous consent that this article from the washington post be printed in the record in its entirety. the washington post has reported that u.s. appeals court judge merrick garland is getting a boost for his supreme court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him best--his former law clerks. it goes on to say that 68 former law clerks for this judge have written to members of congress recommending him based on their personal experience of working professionally with him. let me read this passage from their letter: there are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward chief judge garland. our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers. he has stood by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. he has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. he is a constant source of career advice and guidance. and he has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty. this article one might expect from his clerks saying what a good person he is, but they have gone out of their way to suggest to the senate that a person of this quality and this integrity should be treated fairly--fairly. i listened to some of the comments that are being made on the republican side about this man, and it is a long way from fairness. what they are saying to him is we don't care about where you came from. we don't care about your education. we don't care about your professional qualifications. we don't care about your career on the bench. we care that you have been nominated by president barack obama, and as far as senator mcconnell is concerned, enough said. if barack obama nominates this man, senator mcconnell has made it clear he will deny to him something that has never ever been denied to a supreme court nominee in the history of the united states of america: a fair hearing. that is why it is painful for a lot of republican senators to go back and face audiences. the partisans in the audience come in, in a predictable state, with republicans saying: hold the line. don't let obama act like a president of the united states. we want him to go away. democrats come in and ask: can't you at least give this man a hearing? i would say to my republican colleagues: listen to the people who view themselves as independents in this country, folks who don't carry a party label. they are saying overwhelmingly that merrick garland is entitled to a hearing before the u.s. senate. he is an extraordinarily well-qualified man. there is no credible justification to refuse to give him a hearing. merrick garland was born in chicago. his father ran a small business. his mother volunteered in the rogers park neighborhood. he was the grandson of immigrants who fled anti-semitism in the pale of settlement in russia. they came to america in the early 1900s. judge garland grew up in lincolnwood, il. he graduated at the top of his class at niles west high school in skokie. he earned an undergraduate and law degree from harvard. he was a law clerk to judge henry friendly on the second circuit and to supreme court justice william brennan. he had a distinguished career at the justice department. they sent merrick garland down after the oklahoma city tragedy, when there was a terrible incident--a domestic terrorist bombing--that killed and maimed so many people. the prosecution of that accused terrorist was the highest priority for the department of justice. they had to get it right, not just for the cause of justice but for the victims and their families. they had to get it right on this prosecution. so they sent their very best prosecutor, merrick [[page s1649]] garland. he was given that responsibility and took it very seriously. he used to carry around with him the names of those who died in that oklahoma city terrorist incident as a reminder of the solemn responsibility which he carried in this undertaking. that is the kind of person he is. he successfully prosecuted those who were engaged in the terrorism that caused that terrible event. the department of justice thought that highly of him, and his performance in oklahoma city was so stellar that he achieved his goal--a fair and effective prosecution. the senate considered merrick garland for the second highest court of the land, the d.c. circuit court in 1997. he received a majority vote on both sides of the aisle, republicans and democrats. the total final vote was 76 to 23. thirty-two senate republicans voted to confirm judge garland. he has been on that court--the d.c. circuit--for 19 years and he has been the chief judge for the last 3 years. throughout his lengthy judicial career, chief judge garland has been praised for his intelligence, knowledge of the law, adherence to precedent, and his ability to forge a consensus. listen to what chief justice john roberts of the u.s. supreme court said during his own confirmation hearing: ``any time judge garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.'' i have my differences with chief justice roberts of the u.s. supreme court, but i will be the first to say his presentation to the senate judiciary committee was one i will never forget. he sat there for 2 days, without a note in front of him, and answered every question effectively and eloquently. i left there with the distinct impression he was one of the brightest individuals who had ever been nominated to the supreme court. so this man, chief justice roberts, whether we agree with his politics or his decisions, should be listened to when he says of merrick garland, president obama's nominee, that if you disagreed with judge garland, you know you are in a difficult area. that is high praise from chief justice john roberts. it is high praise for a man who has been denied a hearing before the senate judiciary committee for the first time in the history of the senate. i commend judge garland for his many decades of public service and congratulate him and his wife lynn and their daughters for the great honor they have been given to be nominated to the u.s. supreme court. i offer as well a word of apology to them for the way they are being treated by the u.s. senate. this is not right. i hope that in the quiet and the solitude of their own republican caucus lunch, they will close the door and turn to one another and say: this is not fair. it is not right. we owe this man a hearing. i am not saying he should be rubberstamped. i am not saying the senate republican majority should approve this man, although i think it is difficult not to. i am saying he should be given a hearing. he deserves that respect from the u.s. senate. it would be terrible and beneath the dignity of the senate republicans to close the doors of the senate to such an accomplished american and deny him a fair hearing and a vote. the president has met his responsibility. the senate should do no less. i know merrick garland is in for a rough ride. the senior senator from texas said as much a few weeks ago. he said president obama's supreme court nominee would ``bear some resemblance to a pinata.'' do we know what that means? remember, if you will, that mexican custom of filling a paper mache animal with candy, then blindfolding a child and giving him a stick or a bat to try to swing wildly and beat on that pinata until it is broken open and the candy hits the floor. that was the analogy used by the senior senator from texas as to how merrick garland should expect to be treated if his nomination comes before the senate. it is a sad commentary, but it may reflect the reality of the bitter political environment we live in. it is troubling to hear our nomination process in the senate characterized this way. there is a way to avoid pinata politics. let's give merrick garland a fair hearing. right now, conservative groups and some senate republicans are taking their swings blindly at merrick garland. they are flailing around, hoping to find some argument to justify the mistreatment which they are offering. for example, there is a rightwing advocacy group calling itself the judicial crisis network, whatever that is, that recently announced a multi-state ad campaign against judge garland. how about that. they will not give him a hearing. they will not even let him sit down in a chair under oath and face questions and give answers, but they have started a multi-state ad campaign against him. the campaign said that with garland on the bench, the second amendment would be ``gutted'' because ``in two separate cases, garland has demonstrated his strong hostility to gun owner rights.'' several senate republicans have echoed this attack. they have heard this so-called judicial crisis network ad and they have decided to amplify it. however, there is no argument that can be made seriously or fairly for the proposition that judge garland opposes the second amendment in his rulings. there are two cases mentioned by this rightwing organization on the subject. they date back many years to 2000 and 2007. the first was a case involving the auditing of background check records. when that case was appealed to the supreme court, the justice department of president george w. bush, led by conservative attorney general john ashcroft, agreed with judge garland's position. there was no controversy as far as they were concerned. so a republican president and a republican attorney general agreed with the ruling of judge garland. in the other case in which judge garland is accused of having overstepped the bounds on the second amendment, he never even addressed any substantive second amendment issue. if the judicial crisis network was so outraged by these decisions in the year 2000 and the year 2007, why didn't they bring it up in 2010 when merrick garland was in the running to fill a vacancy on the supreme court? in that year, carrie severino, the head of that organization--the judicial crisis network--told the washington post: of those the president could nominate, we can do a lot worse than merrick garland. he's the best scenario we could hope for to bring the tension and the politics in the city down a notch for the summer. i just quoted the person who was in charge of the judicial crisis network when merrick garland was under consideration for the supreme court six years ago. now that same network has decided to spend millions of dollars to stop this nominee. if judge garland's views on the second amendment were so objectionable, why has he been praised by charles cooper, the gun lobby's top outside attorney? on march 28 of this year, cooper told the washington post about his ``high opinion'' of garland as a judge. so here is the reality. rightwing advocacy groups like the judicial crisis network are swinging wildly at judge garland. they mischaracterize his record and they attack his judgment in an effort to discredit him. if the senate holds a public hearing for garland, he would at least have his day to state his position clearly on the second amendment, but they are so afraid of what he is going to say, the republican leadership in the senate has denied merrick garland an opportunity for a hearing at this point in time. at a hearing, the american people could judge for themselves. how about that for a novel idea; that we would put merrick garland under oath, sit him at a table, ask whatever questions we consider to be important for his nomination, and then let the american people decide. the republicans will have nothing to do with that. senator mcconnell has said from the start he is never going to allow that to occur. the senate is doing judge garland and our nation a grave disservice if we don't move forward with a public hearing on this nomination, as we have with every other supreme court nominee that has been sent by a president. just for the record, go back to 1987, when a vacancy occurred on the supreme court, and in 1988, the last year of ronald reagan's republican presidency, he sent a nominee to the u.s. senate to be considered. anthony kennedy was a reagan nominee, and the democratic-controlled u.s. senate not only gave anthony kennedy a hearing, [[page s1650]] they gave him a unanimous vote, sending him to the supreme court. despite the fact that ronald reagan was a ``lameduck''--the last year of his presidency--the senate at that time respected the office of the presidency and respected the constitution enough to give anthony kennedy his day before the senate judiciary committee, his day before the u.s. senate. if it was fair enough for a republican president in a democratic senate, why isn't the same standard to be used when it comes to president obama's nominee being sent to the senate on this day? it cannot be explained away. what does this vacancy on the supreme court mean? there are only eight members of a nine-member court. already the supreme court has deadlocked twice on 4-to-4 tie votes since justice scalia's passing. almost 50 cases still need to be decided in this term. major legal questions may go unresolved because the senate is not doing its job and not filling this vacancy. judge garland does not deserve to be used as a pinata--a word used by a senate republican describing what he would face in the senate. let's give him an opportunity to rebut any attacks made against him. let him explain himself on the record in full view of the american public. let the american people decide if the ads and attacks against him are valid or baseless. i urge my republican colleagues: do not follow the lead of rightwing advocacy groups and attack judge garland's character or record when you refuse to give the man a chance to respond at a public hearing. that is fundamentally unfair. this is a real moment of truth for the senate. no supreme court nominee has ever been denied a hearing before, and merrick garland should not be the first. the message of the american people to the senate republican majority is very simple, three words: do your job. do your job under the constitution. have a hearing. be fair to this man. don't dream up excuses. don't argue with this president who won by 5 million votes over mitt romney. don't disrespect the office of the presidency or the constitution, which in its clarity establishes our responsibility to give a hearing to this nominee. my republican colleagues need to do their job and to schedule a hearing for merrick garland without delay. mr. president, i yield the floor. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: garland's ex-clerks: confirm our old boss (by mike debonis) u.s. appeals court judge merrick garland is getting a boost for his supreme court nomination from some of the lawyers who know him best: his former law clerks. sixty-eight former garland clerks signed a letter delivered monday to senate leaders of both parties, urging them to confirm his nomination. the signers comprise all but three of the ex-clerks garland has employed since he joined the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in 1997. and the three holdouts have a good reason: they are clerks for supreme court justices. the three-page tribute is both professional and personal. ``there are not many bosses who so uniformly inspire the loyalty that we all feel toward chief judge garland,'' the ex-clerks write. ``our enthusiasm is both a testament to his character and a reflection of his commitment to mentoring and encouraging us long after we left his chambers. he has stood by our side during the happiest moments of our lives--quite literally, having officiated the weddings of seven of his former clerks. he has welcomed us and our growing families into his home. he is a constant source of career advice and guidance. and he has offered love and support in the dark times, too, when we have suffered setbacks, losses, and uncertainty.'' clerkships on the d.c. circuit are among the nation's most prestigious, second only to the supreme court itself. the signers have gone on to high-level positions in federal and state government, private practices and academia. several have spent time in the office of the white house counsel; one of those lawyers, danielle gray, served as cabinet secretary to president obama. the letter paints a familiar portrait of garland as a careful judge, a hard-working public servant and a devoted family man. but it also offers a couple of glimpses behind the curtain. in one notable passage, the clerks write that garland ``taught us the value of diversity, in all its forms.'' ``we observed how chief judge garland forged meaningful connections with others from a wide array of backgrounds and ideological perspectives--from the law clerks he hires to the personal and professional relationships he maintains. he finds camaraderie with his fellow judges without regard to who nominated them to the bench. chief judge garland deeply believes that our system of justice works best when those who see things differently are able to work together, in a collegial manner, to arrive at a just result. and when he must disagree with his colleagues, he always does so respectfully.'' and they describe how his private response to the sept 11, 2001, attacks had a profound impression on the four clerks who were working for him at the time: ``from his chambers, we watched with horror the news about the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon. in the days after, we remember the explicit importance chief judge garland placed on coming to the office everyday and continuing to prepare for upcoming cases. in the aftermath of that terrible tragedy, he believed it was more important than ever for the american people to see that their system of government was functioning without interruption--that the rule of law endured!'' mr. durbin. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. blumenthal. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. blumenthal. mr. president, i want to join in the remarks just made by the senior senator from illinois that we have an obligation to do our job and to provide a hearing and a vote for the president's nominee--not as a matter of discretion or convenience but as a mandatory obligation we have as members of this body. it is an obligation that comes from the constitution, which says that we shall exercise this duty of advising and consenting. for all the reasons my colleague has expressed so eloquently, the american people feel that it is our job, and they are right. nothing so epitomizes the feeling of the american people that washington is failing to work, that this body is failing to do its job, that the congress and the federal government are failing the american people, than the failure to deal with this nominee. the refusal to even meet with him mocks the american system of justice. for all who care about the quality of our judicial nominee, this intransigence is both an insult and an injury, and it will do lasting damage to the court if it drags this third branch of government into the mire of partisan bickering. the judicial branch depends, for the enforceability of its decisions, on the trust and credibility of the american people that it is above politics and that decisions made by the judicial branch are on the merits without regard to the special interests and the money that so infects this branch, and they are entitled to our support for the credibility and trust of the judicial branch, and nothing epitomizes the need for that credibility and trust more than the u.s. supreme court. it is the highest court in the land, and it is the most powerful. it is an anomaly in a democratic government because it is unelected, appointed for life, at the top of the judicial pyramid, exercising vast powers, with only the trust and credibility of the american people as its means of enforcement. it has no army or police of its own. its decisions and enforceability depend for their effect on it being above politics. the controversy and the intransigence and refusal to even consider this nominee is a great threat to that institution. lyme and tick-borne disease prevention, education, and research act mr. president, on the issue of getting the job done, i want to go to a separate topic very much on our minds at this time of year, very distinct and different, but i want to join it in these remarks because it is timely as we begin the next phase of our bipartisan efforts to combat lyme and tick-borne diseases. we will be building support this week for a bill that has been introduced by senator ayotte and me, with the strong involvement and leadership of senator gillibrand, s. 1503, the lyme and tick-borne disease prevention, education, and research act, with 13 cosponsors. it is a bipartisan bill that is critically important to public health. today we will be welcoming a number of my friends and constituents from connecticut and around the country who are experts to provide briefings [[page s1651]] to our staffs in sessions that have been organized by senator ayotte, senator gillibrand, and me. we are very pleased to welcome some of the leaders of this effort: john aucott, who is an assistant professor of medicine at the johns hopkins school of medicine; dr. brian fallon, a good friend and leading expert in this area and a professor at the columbia college of physicians and surgeons; ally hilfiger, who has been a survivor and strong supporter and advocate; rebecca tibball, a fourth grade teacher from my home state of connecticut who has been battling lyme disease since august of 2014; and david roth, also a leader and a longstanding patient advocate from new york who in his day job is a managing director at the private sector group blackstone. these individuals are here to call attention to and build support for curing a disease that is literally exploding exponentially in this country and now constitutes an epidemic that literally impinges and cripples the lives of millions of americans. the centers for disease control and prevention indicates that more than 36,000 americans suffered from lyme disease in 2013. it says that the number who actually contracted this disease is probably 10 times higher because it is undetected and undiagnosed in so many people and it is underreported even when it is discovered in individuals. most of the cases of lyme disease occur in a limited number of states. ninety- eight percent of them occur in connecticut, delaware, maine, maryland, massachusetts, minnesota, new hampshire, new jersey, new york, pennsylvania, vermont, virginia, and wisconsin. i name those states because the senators in those states ought to be behind this bill, every single one of them. but those cases are only the ones reported. in many states there is no systematic reporting of lyme disease, so the full extent, breadth, and depth of this epidemic is truly unknown. we know in this body how to respond and recognize a public health threat. it was done for ebola. it is done for influenza. it hopefully will be done for zika. what is needed is the same kind of bipartisan awareness and support for legislation to help people who suffer from lyme and other tick-borne diseases. sometimes this senator is asked: why has the congress failed to recognize and respond to this severe public health threat? there is no good explanation except for the underreporting and the unawareness, and that is no excuse. in the meantime, the cases of lyme disease are exploding in number, and the severity impacts our economy as well as the quality of life for americans. it affects people's ability to perform their jobs, children's ability to go to school, and families' ability to function normally. the disease, if undetected and untreated, can cause the most severe kinds of pain and disability. lyme disease is named after a town in my state. i have always felt it was tremendously unfair for the beautiful and wonderful town of lyme to have its name bear the burden of this disease, but regardless of the name, the burden is on the entire country--not simply on connecticut and not simply on the northeast or any part of the country or profession--to take action. that action must include provisions in this bill to strengthen lyme disease surveillance and reporting, an education program, establishing epidemiological research objectives for tick-borne diseases, and the preparation of a regular report to congress on the progress of efforts to combat these devastating tick- borne diseases. the effects are devastating, pernicious, and insidious, creeping into every aspect of a victim's life. our bill has earned the support of 13 senators from both parties, including five members of the help committee. when it comes to fighting lyme disease, there is no partisanship. the ticks that carry this disease don't know a red state from a blue one. they don't make any discrimination between the boundaries of different states. the devastating diseases that can spring from these ticks are common to our entire country and therefore demand a national response and a federal program that we have outlined in this bill. i am proud to join with senator ayotte and senator gillibrand in this effort. i urge my colleagues to support this bill, to send your staffs to the briefing we have today. i thank others from connecticut--such as alexandra cohen--who are going to be coming today, and i look forward to continuing this fight, which has to be one of a nationwide commitment. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. flake). the senator from south dakota. isis mr. thune. mr. president, i rise to address last month's tragic terror attacks in brussels and istanbul by isis. it is critical for the senate to consider these significant events as we get back to work on bills enhancing security and setting policies for air transportation. in brussels, 35 innocent people, including four americans, lost their lives in barbaric attacks by isis at a subway station and airport terminal. in istanbul, an isis suicide bombing killed four on central street and left dozens more injured. my thoughts and prayers are with those injured, the families of the victims, and the citizens of belgium and turkey. in the past 2 years, isis has orchestrated 29 attacks on western targets around the world, killing more than 650 innocent people. a decade ago, the group of violent jihadists behind isis fit a fairly conventional definition of a terrorist group. operating in iraq, they endeavored to kill americans, iraqis, and others working to build a free and democratic nation. today, however, calling isis a mere terrorist group may not fully convey the seriousness of the problem. isis, or the so-called islamic state, has taken control of a significant amount of territory in iraq and syria. within this territory, isis has established a self- proclaimed capital city and effective sovereignty over other populated urban centers. it collects taxes, operates and profits from oil well operations, controls banking, and rules over substantial agricultural acreage. these operations help fund and sustain not only isis armed fighters but also the group's attempt to build actual institutions that spread its message of hate. unfortunately, isis has enjoyed considerable success communicating and spreading its distorted vision of a grand islamic caliphate claiming authority over all muslims. branches of isis, trying to replicate what has happened in syria and iraq, have taken root elsewhere and carried out operations in destabilized areas, including libya, the sinai peninsula of egypt, and yemen. a recent report estimated that as many as 31,000 isis adherents have traveled from 86 countries to join the organization in iraq and syria. more than 5,000 of these recruits have come from western europe and 150 from the united states. in addition to those americans who have actually traveled abroad, researchers at george washington university estimated in december that there are 900 active investigations of isis sympathizers here in the united states. let me repeat that--900 investigations of isis sympathizers here in the united states. this doesn't included those who have been radicalized without noticeable warning, such as a couple in san bernardino who weren't known to authorities before they killed 14 in a shooting attack last december. over the past few years, isis's reach has expanded dramatically, and claims that our current policies have contained the organizations and its dangerous message are both false and reckless. we have had some successes in targeting senior isis officials, but as we saw in brussels, in san bernardino, and elsewhere, those efforts have not lessened the threat posed by a terrorist state that is successfully propagating its ideology all over the world. so what can we do to protect against the threat posed by isis? here are a few things: first, we need a president who is committed to forming a robust coalition to destroy isis abroad. real american leadership against isis must be manifested in sustained engagement against the enemy. we need an administration intent on eliminating the group's sources of income and its control of territory which facilitates an illusion of legitimacy for its followers. incremental progress is not enough. indeed, the washington post reported last week that some terrorism experts believe pressure on the group's finances [[page s1652]] could make isis more dangerous and unpredictable until it is defeated. second, we need to control our borders. we need to know who is coming in and out of our country and why. this includes screening travelers for ties to isis and to its sympathizers. one of the greatest threats facing europe is citizens who leave their homes to fight for isis and then return to recruit or conduct operations in their communities. we also face this threat from european isis fighters, the return of american citizens who have fought for isis, and agents of isis posing as war refugees. although we have passed bipartisan legislation to tighten some screening requirements, we need the administration to enforce the law rather than attempt to undermine and work around it. third, as a final line of defense, we need to better secure the homeland. we must make sure the intelligence community, law enforcement, and homeland security officials have the tools they need to deter attacks and to stop plots before they are launched. this includes the need for constant reassessment of our vulnerabilities so we stay ahead of threats. tomorrow i will chair a hearing at the commerce committee with transportation security administration administrator peter neffenger, who happened to be in brussels during the march 22 attacks. while we mainly see and know the transportation security administration or tsa as the agency behind airport screening of passengers and baggage, the organization actually has a much broader charge. tsa is the designated federal agency for all transportation security matters. as we know from independent covert testing that exposed tsa failures a year ago, tsa still has work to do to improve screening at airports, but tsa also needs to focus on securing transportation by train, bus, pipelines, and through our ports. the diversity of the targets isis selected in its most recent attacks--a subway station, an unsecured airport terminal, and a busy street, underscores the challenge of protecting our citizens from an enemy seeking the path of least resistance to maximize its carnage. to stay ahead of this danger, security officials at tsa and other agencies need to be looking at potential threats before isis does. congress has a role in helping security officials stay ahead of isis. aided by congressional oversight and congressional watchdogs, the commerce committee has already approved bipartisan legislation that senator bill nelson and i have offered to address airport security vulnerabilities. our bill is cosponsored by the homeland security committee's chair and ranking member, senator johnson and senator carper. among other provisions, our legislation improves the vetting process for airport workers seeking or holding a security credential that grants access to restricted sections of an airport. over the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers have been caught in the act helping criminal organizations. on march 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine after she was confronted by airport security officials in california. in florida, on march 26, an airline gate agent was arrested with a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an associate. according to press reports, the agent told authorities the money was connected to illegal activity, but he knew few other details. some of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals--but not terrorists. as we work to address concerns about an insider threat scenario, where an aviation worker helps terrorists, criminals who have broken laws for their own financial gain and those with histories of violence are a good place to start. ensuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that isis in october killed 224 on a russian flight leaving egypt. many experts believe this attack had help from an aviation employee. in s. 2361, the airport security enhancement and oversight act, senator nelson and i propose not only tightening vetting procedures for workers who need a security credential, but we also expand the list of criminal convictions that disqualifies an applicant from holding one. at present, even applicants convicted for embezzlement, racketeering, perjury, robbery, sabotage, immigration law violations, and assault with a deadly weapon can still obtain an airport security badge granting access to restricted areas. our bill closes this loophole while updating airport security rules, expanding random inspections of airport workers, and requiring the review of airport perimeter security. the commerce committee has also approved another tsa-related bill, h.r. 2843, the tsa precheck expansion act. this bill would expand participation in the tsa precheck application program by developing private sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. as a result, more passengers would be vetted before they even arrived at the airport and received expedited screening. this would get passengers through security checkpoints more quickly to ensure they don't pose the kind of easy target that isis suicide bombers found at the brussels airport. historically, this body has passed aviation security enhancements separate from a reauthorization of the federal aviation administration. while i still prefer this separate approach and believe the senate should pass our consensus security legislation without delay, i will pursue every option to enact these improvements and will vigorously oppose any effort to water down any security efforts that passed the commerce committee. as we look at isis and consider necessary steps to stop attacks, let's remember our recent history of fighting terrorism. in the 1990s, our nation not only fell behind on intelligence and airport security, but we did not act with force against al qaeda's enclaves in afghanistan. this was true even after we recognized a significant threat following attacks on our embassies in east africa and on the uss cole in yemen. only after the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon did our nation pursue a strong military response and adopt significant reforms to enhance our homeland security. like al qaeda, isis is now a significant danger. while we are doing more to push our homeland security and intelligence agencies to meet current and future threats, we are unwise to allow this enemy time and multiple chances to inflict mass casualties. as a legislative body, we have already passed legislation closing a border security vulnerability in our visa waiver program and have an opportunity in the bill that senator nelson and i have offered to guard against an insider threat at airports. as lawmakers, we are going in the right direction. however, our responsibility to the people we represent does not end there. until this administration or its successor changes the facts on the ground, we also have an obligation to speak about the continued threat of isis, especially when the administration downplays the need for a more aggressive response. we have an obligation to continue discussing the genocide of christians and other religious groups in areas under isis control, and we have an obligation to scrutinize executive actions and conduct rigorous oversight of administration initiatives that pose risks to our homeland. if we can't do this, we have learned very little. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from pennsylvania. mr. casey. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. congratulating the villanova wildcats on winning the 2016 ncaa men's college basketball championship mr. casey. mr. president, i wish to speak for a few minutes on the floor to send congratulations on my own behalf and also on behalf of the people of pennsylvania to the villanova wildcats for a great win last night in the ncaa final. it was a remarkable game for a lot of reasons. my wife and i watched every minute of it, as i know so many did. it was a remarkable game even before the last-second shot, but even more so after the shot made by kris jenkins. we are grateful, on behalf of the people of pennsylvania, to commend and salute villanova university and, of course, the team itself. [[page s1653]] in particular, i commend the players, not only kris jenkins but the entire team. at the same time, we commend the work done by jay wright. he is a great coach. he was awarded the naismith award as coach of the year this year, but we also commend him for leading villanova this year and for the way he conducted himself, even in the aftermath of a win. we learn a lot about people in victory and defeat, whether that is in the athletic contest or even in politics or life itself. i thought jay wright showed a lot of class in the way he conducted himself after winning, which is sometimes not the case in sports today. i want to commend them as well for their great teamwork that obviously has to play out not just on the court in one game but over the length of a season--the practice and the hard work and the working together and the way they built each other up. there are so many instances where this team really was a team in reality, not just in terms of people talking about them as a team. i am not sure they could have shot better. i am told--and i hope i have this right--they had a 58-percent shooting field goal percentage throughout the tournament. that is a remarkable achievement. again, that doesn't just happen; it happens because of hard work and because of a great coach. i want to commend and salute the team and congratulate them on winning a very difficult tournament. this is a tournament that had a lot of upsets and a lot of twists and turns before the team came out no. 1. that is a great achievement. finally, i commend and salute the university and father peter donahue, the president. we know him as father peter. i want to thank him. he sent me a villanova hat, which i wore during the semifinal game or part of the game. i made sure i wore it at least for a few minutes during the final game. i was grateful he sent me that reminder of team spirit. in addition to father peter in the larger villanova community, we want to salute the students, who were so loyal, and the fans, who may not have been students but who were either graduates of villanova or just supporters. and of course the alumni made it possible for the team to have the kind of support they have had over many years. opioid epidemic and children's exposure to lead poisoning mr. president, in my recent travels across pennsylvania, two issues arose that i know the presiding officer and others may have heard about in the time they were away from washington, and i know there are many others, but i will just mention two that the people of our state are thinking a lot about and are worried about and expect us to take action concerning. no. 1 is the opioid epidemic across the country, which has caused the kind of death and devastation that none of us can even begin to imagine. in pennsylvania alone, more than 2,700 people died in 2014 as a result of some kind of drug overdose. so this is a major challenge. we made tremendous progress when we passed our bipartisan bill here, the so-called cara bill. that was a good move and an important step for the senate. i hope we can follow up on that with the $600 million in funding that local law enforcement and treatment experts and others have asked us for. we need to finish the job in terms of making sure the senate is taking the right steps on this challenge. the second issue--which i will mention just briefly because we don't have time today to develop it further--is lead poisoning in children. we know what happened in flint, the horror and the tragedy of flint, but in a state such as mine, the biggest challenge we have is not necessarily lead from water or in the water systems that would adversely affect children. in our case, because we have a lot of old homes, it is lead paint and the exposure to lead paint and the high lead levels that put children in a precarious situation in the short run but even long term because some of these impacts, if the levels are very high, can be irreversible. we have to make sure we are doing more to protect our children not only in pennsylvania but across the country in terms of making sure that fewer and fewer children are exposed to high lead levels. i know we will talk more about that. those are two major challenges that i know confront pennsylvania and also confront our country. with that, mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. flake). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. filling the supreme court vacancy and working together in the senate mr. cornyn. mr. president, as you know, we have been back home in our states for the last couple of weeks or traveling, listening to our constituents. it was great to be back home and to spend some time talking to the people who i work for about the challenges facing our country and what we have been doing in the u.s. senate to try to address those challenges. while it is always true that people wish there would be more consensus building and more solutions offered, i would say that, by and large, people feel we had a pretty productive 2015 and are hoping we can continue that sort of productivity here in the senate in 2016, even though this is a presidential election year. yesterday was a good example of that productivity. we passed a trademark enforcement piece of legislation basically without--it was unanimous, to the best of my knowledge. all the senators here in the chamber voted for it without going through the official procedural hoops that are required in order to process legislation here in the senate. previously we passed legislation--recently the comprehensive addiction and recovery act--to deal with the crisis involving opioid or prescription drug painkillers that are being abused around the country, and people are unfortunately falling into that trap, and then the cheap heroin that sometimes is used as a substitute if people can't find the opioid prescription drugs. so congress actually has been doing the people's business here. of course, we are in the type of profession where people will sometimes say: well, we think you are doing a great job. and others will say: well, we don't think you are doing quite so great a job. but that is the nature of the beast. either way, it is always good to be back home. as i was talking to my constituents back home, i was glad to hear one thing. no matter what part of the state i was traveling in, there was appreciation for the decision we made to give the voters a voice on who makes the next lifetime appointment to the supreme court. texans want to have a say in who replaces justice scalia on our nation's highest court, and i believe their voice should be heard. we are already engaged in the presidential primaries process. today is the wisconsin primary. it will not be that long before we have a new president who will make that appointment. i simply believe it is important--particularly in something that could extend for the next 25 or 30 years and really affect the balance of power on the supreme court--that this be left to the voters. we all know we did not end up in this position overnight. in fact, there is a lot of history. i remember that back when i came to the senate, i was frustrated by the fact that there was so much politics at play in the judicial confirmation process. having served as a state court judge for 13 years, i had some pretty strong views about that. but the problem is, there has been a lot that has transpired in the interim. everything from the biden rule to the reid statement in 2005 was really a threat saying that if president george w. bush were to appoint a judge to the supreme court, it was within the authority of the u.s. senate not to hold a vote on that appointment. that was in 2005. that was the democratic leader. and then in 2007 when george w. bush was still president, 18 months before he left office, senator schumer, the next democratic leader, said there should be a presumption against confirmation. this is something that is nearly unprecedented. then we know that in the interim there has been this development of filibusters or the requirement of 60 votes in order to get judges confirmed brought to us by our [[page s1654]] democratic friends, as well as something we didn't think would ever happen but, in fact, did happen under democratic leadership: the so- called nuclear option--in other words, breaking the senate rules in order to confirm judges mainly to the dc circuit court of appeals--what some call the second most powerful court in the nation--in order to pack that court with judges who are more likely to affirm president obama's constitutional overreach. so, as i said, much to my chagrin and i bet to a lot of people's chagrin, we have seen the playbook torn up by our democratic colleagues and rewritten. the question is, are we going to be operating under a different set of rules than they would if the roles were reversed? frankly, my constituents back home think the rules ought to be the same no matter who happens to be in the majority and who happens to be in the white house. even more significantly, the supreme court is the final authority for many of the most pressing issues that face our country. the court often acts as a constitutional counterweight to the passions of both the legislative and executive branches. we have seen the supreme court operate time and time again as a check on the obama administration's lawless actions. we saw this in the recess-appointment case. we have seen it in a number of different cases where the court has said to the obama administration: you have simply overextended your reach beyond legitimate boundaries. i am thankful for that important counterbalance in our government and the give-and-take that the founding fathers intended for us to have with three coequal branches of government. but, as i said, the next supreme court justice could well change the ideological direction of the court for a generation. rightly or wrongly, the supreme court has the final word on issues as varied as the scope of the president's power, the ability of the states to make their own decisions about self-government, and questions of personal liberty and the like. the court can and has made all the difference in the world, and one justice can affect that for a long time. we recall justice scalia as somebody who believed that the words of the constitution mattered greatly, and he served on the court for 30 years. justice scalia was what was sometimes called an originalist. in other words, he believed the court had an obligation to apply the constitution and the law as written, not based on some substituted value judgment for what perhaps the unelected, lifetime-tenured judges would have preferred in terms of policy. that is not their role. they don't stand for election. it is our role as the policymakers in the political branches who do stand for election--and thus give the american people a chance to voice their pleasure or displeasure, as the case may be, with the direction that we perhaps take the country when it comes to policy. but that is not a role the supreme court should play. we need to approach filling this seat with great care. the administration and their liberal allies are now trying to basically throw everything but the kitchen sink at stopping the american people from getting a voice in this matter. in other words, they are trying to force congress's hand or the senate's hand to confirm the presidential nominee at this time. they are spending millions of dollars on tv advertising. they have hired consultants, and they found some sympathetic allies in the media to criticize us. i don't begrudge anybody who has a different point of view than i do about this, but i simply cannot in good conscience vote to confirm another obama nominee to the u.s. supreme court in the waning days of this president's term in office. i happen to believe we should not process this nomination. we should exercise the power we have under the constitution to grant or withhold consent, and in this case to withhold consent. but here we are, several weeks after the president announced his nominee, and nothing has really changed. all the money and the consultants in the world are not going to change the fact that the american people are going to have their say. we don't know exactly how that will turn out, but that is because this is based not on the personality of the nominee but on the principle that the american people should have their voice heard. as i said, the president has the authority to nominate anybody he chooses, but that doesn't change our responsibility or our authority under that same constitution. we remain committed to the idea that this vacancy should be filled by the next president. i want to be clear that the american people do deserve a voice here, and we will make sure they are heard. in the meantime, as i started out saying, there are a lot of things we can do working together. just because we disagree about this one item doesn't mean we have to disagree about everything or that congress needs to lapse into dysfunction. we currently have a bill pending before us involving the federal aviation administration and the very important topic of safe and secure air travel. we can disagree about how to proceed with the president's nominee to the supreme court and still work together to pass other good consensus legislation. so i hope all of us, our colleagues across the aisle and on this side of the aisle, will continue to work together to do things i think would help the country a lot, things such as criminal justice reform--a bill that has been voted out of the judiciary committee, that enjoys broad bipartisan support, and that the president of the united states has said he supports. there is also other important legislation that i am very concerned about and interested in involving the intersection of mental illness with our criminal justice system and the fact that our jails have become the de facto warehouses for people with mental illness who are going untreated and obviously the homeless who are living on our streets, many of whom are suffering from mental illness. i hope we can continue to work together on these other consensus matters even though we disagree about this one very important matter. i am confident that we can and we will. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. rubio). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cardin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. cardin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. nomination of merrick garland mr. cardin. mr. president, during the recess last week, i had the opportunity to meet with judge merrick garland of the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, president obama's nominee to fill the existing vacancy of an associate justice of the u.s. supreme court. during our meeting, we discussed the role of the supreme court and protecting the civil rights of americans. we discussed a number of national security challenges, including those relating to the detainees at guantanamo bay, cuba. we discussed the citizens united case and campaign finance law. we talked about the respect for each branch of government and our constitutional system of checks and balances. we spoke about the important role of precedent in our judicial decisions and the need to build consensus on decisions. we discussed the value of promoting pro bono work in the legal profession and the need to address the growing access-to-justice gap. i was pleased to hear that as an attorney at the justice department, chief justice garland worked to clarify ethics rules to allow government lawyers to engage in additional pro bono work. what i was doing is what i hope every member in the senate will do, and that is finding out more about judge garland, his judicial philosophy, the way he has conducted his life, his respect for the constitution and the precedents of the judicial branch of government, looking at current issues and seeing how judge garland views those current issues. that is all part of a confirmation process. the president, under the constitution, has done his job; that is, he has made the nomination of who he believes should fill justice scalia's vacancy. it is now up to the senate to do [[page s1655]] our job, and our job starts with members of the senate meeting with judge garland to be able to see one-on-one, without cameras glaring, how judge garland responds to our individual issues. we obviously have his record, his background, his public service, what he has done as a lawyer, what he has done as a prosecutor, and what he has done as a judge on the circuit court. we also should have a confirmation hearing in the judiciary committee, which will give us more information. under the constitution, the responsibility of the president is to make the nomination. it is now up to the senate to do our job, and our job is to consider that nominee, for each senator to learn as much as they possibly can--this is a critically important position, obviously, the supreme court of the united states--and for the institution to hold hearings and to vote. each senator will have to make his or her own judgment on whether we should vote for or against confirmation, but we have a responsibility to consider that nomination and a responsibility to vote. i must say that i was very impressed by the nominee during the course of our meeting. he has impeccable qualifications as a prosecutor, judge, and now chief judge of what many call the second highest court in the land. the senate confirmed judge garland on a bipartisan basis for his current judgeship, which he has held for nearly two decades. chief judge garland strikes me as a thoughtful and deliberate person who has dedicated his life to public service. and i am proud to say that the nominee is a marylander and lives in bethesda in montgomery county, md. chief judge garland is the nominee for the supreme court and should be dealt with in this term of congress. it is not a matter for the next president and the next congress; it is a matter for this president and this congress. there are 9 months left in this year, and to suggest that we don't have the time and the president doesn't have the authority to appoint a nominee is outrageous, and it is an affront to the constitution. this nomination is not about popularity or politics; it is about finding the next justice who will advance the rule of law in this country, who will recognize the responsibility of the supreme court to be the final arbiter on constitutional issues, and having a person who can bring about greater consensus among his colleagues. as more of my colleagues meet judge garland, they will see that this is one of his many strengths. we need to go through the process and give chief judge garland a chance. i think it is hard to understand how you are excused from doing your job for 9 months by not having a confirmation hearing or vote. i don't think the american people understand that. quite frankly, i don't understand that. i don't understand why we are not going through the regular order. regular order would be for us individually to meet with judge garland and for the judiciary committee to hold a hearing and to schedule a timely vote on the floor of the senate. i think more and more senators will come to that conclusion. the president did his job, and it is now time for the senate to do its job. the american people want to see nine justices on the supreme court when it convenes its new term in october. we have a new term beginning in october of this year. we expect to see nine justices on the court to make decisions. you don't resolve issues on a 4-to-4 vote. we hopefully will have greater consensus. we shouldn't have a divided court. we should be able to get more collegiality on the supreme court, but we also should be able to make a decision. the supreme court needs to be able to make a decision. with eight justices, in too many cases they are not going to be able to make a decision. article ii, section 2, of the constitution states that the president ``shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint . . . judges of the supreme court.'' the president has no alternative under the constitution but to make a nomination when there is a vacancy. there is a vacancy on the supreme court due to justice scalia's untimely death. the president did his job. the constitution says very clearly that we--the senate--have to advise and consent. that is our requirement. that is not optional; we have that as a requirement. never have we denied an opportunity to consider a supreme court nominee. it is now up to us to consider that nominee, and we should consider that nominee by doing our job--interviewing judge garland, scheduling a committee hearing, and voting on that nominee. the american people twice elected president obama to a 4-year term in office. their voice has been heard very clearly. elections have consequences, and president obama has carried out the constitutional responsibilities and duties of his office by nominating judge garland as the successor to justice scalia. the president is simply doing the job the american people elected him to do. the president doesn't stop working simply because it is an election year. he has more than 9 months left in office, as do senators who will face the voters in november. congress should not stop working, either, in this election year. of course, every senator has the right to make his or her own judgment on whether they will vote for or against confirmation. senators were elected for 6-year terms by the citizens of their states and have the right and obligation to vote as they see fit. president obama was elected by the people of the united states for two 4-year terms and has the right and obligation to nominate judges. history has shown that when the roles were reversed and democrats held the majority in the senate, supreme court and judicial nominees for republican presidents were given hearings and up-or-down votes regardless of when the vacancies occurred. while i might have picked different judges, as a senator, i voted to confirm the vast majority of president bush's judicial nominations in his final year in office. i will continue to carry out my constitutional responsibilities that i undertook when i became a senator and swore to support the constitution. let me remind my colleagues that a democratically controlled senate confirmed justice kennedy to the supreme court during the last year of president ronald reagan's final term in 1988. senators also confirmed justice murphy in 1940, justice cardozo in 1932, and justice brandeis in 1916. the precedent of the senate indicates that we need to take up this nominee. what the republicans are effectively trying to do is temporarily shrink the supreme court from nine to eight justices and shorten the term of the president from 4 years to 3 years. why? because the president is of a different party than the senate. this is disgraceful and indefensible. let me quote justice sandra day o'connor, who was appointed by president ronald reagan in 1981 as the first female justice of the supreme court. when asked about the vacancy on the court created by the death of justice scalia, justice o'connor said, ``we need somebody there now to do the job, and let's get on with it.'' i agree with justice o'connor. let's do our job and fulfill the senate's constitutional responsibilities and vote up or down on judge garland's nomination. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will

Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for my 132nd ``Time to Wake Up'' speech. We are now back from recess, and while we were away, one little thing and three really big things happened. The little thing has to do with the so-called war on coal which we have heard so much nonsense about in this Chamber. There was this article, which I am showing on this chart, saying: ``Natural gas has been waging a war on coal for more than a decade, and this is the year it plants the flag.'' Natural gas has been waging a war on coal. Not Obama. Not liberals. Natural gas. The article predicts a resulting ``wave'' of coal plant retirements. Who wrote this? Some green, lefty publication? Actually, it was the Wall Street Journal news department. So as coal companies go bankrupt left and right, there is the coal story. Natural gas has been waging war on coal for more than a decade. Spinning this against the President has been easy politics, but false, and that false political strategy has left coal country with what? Nothing. A carbon fee could produce revenues that could power wealth into coal country, but, no, what they got instead was someone to blame--someone to blame wrongly. Great job. Now to the three big things that happened during our recess. First, a group of very distinguished scientists, led by legendary climate scientist Dr. James Hansen, warned us that this climate change thing is likely to be a lot worse than we thought. Their sweeping synthesis, which underwent an involved and public peer-review process, suggests the possibility of greater sea level rise in this century than forecast. It suggests, worse, even epic storms, and it posits ``losing functionality of all coastal cities.'' How about that for a phrase? They go on to conclude, obviously, that ``the economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable.'' That was one. Second is the Great Barrier Reef, a wonder of the world, hit by the worst coral bleaching ever measured. For those of my colleagues who don't know, uplanders who may not understand what coral bleaching is, it is like cardiac arrest for coral. You are not necessarily dead yet, but there is a very good chance you will be, and for sure you are in serious trouble and you will need time to recover. That is what is happening in the Great Barrier Reef. The third thing is a new study out of UMass and Penn State which found that the expected loss of Antarctic ice ``nearly doubles'' prior estimates of sea level rise. I am from an ocean State. I am from Rhode Island, the Ocean State. This is consequential. How consequential? Here is what one of the authors of the study said: ``You're remapping the way the planet looks from space with those numbers, not just subtle changes about which neighborhoods are going to be susceptible to storm surge,'' but remapping the way the planet looks from space. Of course, CO 2 levels continue to exceed 400 parts per million against a human history where they were always between 170 and 300 until the industrial era drove it up. So that is not great news, but here is what is sickening about it. We don't seem to care here. It has all been in the news. Senators read the news. It is not like we are being deprived of information. We just as an institution do not care. That is a defect. That makes us a defective institution, not to be able to receive and process information like this. This is institutional failure, and we don't even care about that because one might say: You know, I don't really care myself about all of this damage, but as a Member of this body, I get that the U.S. Senate ought to care institutionally. It is like secondary caring. I will do my duty. Even if I personally don't care about oceans or reefs or coasts or storms, I am in. I am in, even though it is not my thing, because I know it is important. But we don't even do that. So we really don't care. Why? Why would we be so blind? We are not all terrible people. Some of us actually spend time outdoors and profess to care about nature. So why does the Senate, as a body collectively, not give a hoot? It is a deadly combination of politics and money. That is what investigation and history will show, and the investigations are underway. The history will not be pretty. We are surrounded by money. Senators exist in a world of money the way fish exist in a world of water. We are so accustomed to it, we barely even notice it. Hundreds of millions of dollars every year in lobbying money surround us. Hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money every election have to be raised. Hundreds of millions in PAC money pours in and exerts its influence, and we don't even know how much dark money there is flowing around through loopholes the size of the Holland Tunnel. Just one--one--dark money group is spending $750 million in the 2016 elections. It is a disgrace, but it has an effect. The interests that spend hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying us want things. The interests who give hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money want things. The PACs and the super PACs pointing $750 million in political artillery at us, they want things. Some want ideological things, but most want money. More exactly, they want things we can do that can be turned into money: licenses, tax breaks, trade advantages, regulations, relief from regulations. You name it, they want it because they can turn it into money. All of that has a desensitizing effect on our values here. If something can't be monetized, we get trained not to care about it. Values that aren't monetized in the marketplace start to seem weird. Who cares about a reef? What is that weird Senator doing talking about a reef? What a silly thing to talk about in our serious world. Now, someone's favorable fat cat tax rate, that is important. Jerking around a perfectly qualified Supreme Court nominee, that is definitely important, but the greatest crisis facing the natural world as we know it, no. And we go along. We go along with that warped value system. It is a lie. It is a moral lie so big it envelopes us, and we acclimate to it. All that money around us slowly anesthetizes our moral and natural senses, and that is how this place becomes Mammon Hall. It is actually even worse than that. It is not just that if you can't cash it in, it doesn't matter around here. It is that big, greedy special interests come here to plunder, and we let them. We let them, and we even help them because we become dependent on their money. Well, I have a proposition. Years ago, one of the Koch brothers, America's biggest polluters, ran for Vice President as a Libertarian Party candidate. When he ran, he learned something. He learned the perverse math of third parties in a two-party system. The perverse math of third parties in a two-party system is that you only hurt the ones you love. You hurt the party you are closest to by your third party taking votes away from the party closest to your politics. Well, the Kochs may be a lot of things, but they aren't stupid, and I think they learned. They learned that a creepy far-right third party that could be put in tow to big polluters was not the right method to achieve their purposes. There was a smarter method. Invade the Republican Party, that Grand Old Party of Theodore Roosevelt, capture it, turn it into the far-right party of their dreams. That was the smart play. Money and secrecy could make it happen, and they are pretty close to having done it. The Republican Party in Congress is as dependent on fossil fuel and polluter money now as a deep sea diver is on his air hose. Cut the airhose or pinch the flow, and we have a diver in real distress. When you control a deep sea diver's airhose, he becomes a pretty obedient diver. It is a form of the Golden Rule: He who wields the gold makes the rules. The political press, by the way, does little to help. It is a game to them. Who will say something appalling we can chatter about on the talk shows? Who is up? Who is down? Who said what about whom? It is akin to a soccer team of 7-year-olds. Most everybody runs to the ball or whatever the shiny object of the moment is, and in the midst of them are outfits that masquerade as the political press, but they are really polluter PR fronts in disguise. They, too, are in tow to the fossil fuel industry. Money and secrecy have their way. [[Page S1657]] So here we are in the Senate, in the face of this news that came to us over the recess, ineffective, defective, idly paying no attention to what is really important as we chase political trifles around, making a mockery of our great American democratic experiment. Well, folks, people are going to notice. This climate mess we have created is only going in one direction. When everybody has noticed, when it is way past denying, elected officials who refused to even look at the problem are going to look pretty foolish, and they are going to have to explain. Well, you see, I thought there was this big hoax. Really. Yes, I thought NASA's scientists and NOAA's scientists were all in on it, along with the U.S. Navy and every National Lab we fund. Hum. That is a big hoax. Oh, did I forget to mention my home State university must have been in on the hoax too? They were all studying climate change effects actually happening in my home State, but I knew better. Great. And every major legitimate American scientific society and most of my home State corporate leaders--I figured they were all wrong. Oh, OK, and where did you get that idea? Oh, from a bunch of guys with financial ties to the polluters. Come on--seriously? Didn't you think that was a pretty obvious conflict of interest? Wow, is that something I should have thought of? But listen. Now I want you to reelect me because I am such a good, prudent, and responsible decisionmaker. Folks, good luck with that. If you think the Republican Party is in trouble now, wait until the day of reckoning comes on climate change. Explain the money. Explain the money. You don't think people are going to figure out how it works? Explain the talk show science you believe instead of the peer-reviewed stuff. Explain the quality of your due diligence into the science. Good luck with that. Explain why you thought NASA, which is driving a rover around on the surface of Mars that they flew there and safely landed--that is probably the greatest scientific and mechanical achievement of our time. They did that, but you say they were part of a hoax on climate change. Really? By the way, I think people here actually owe NASA an apology for saying such nonsense about them, but that is for another day. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming. ObamaCare Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago was the sixth anniversary of President Obama's unpopular health care law. Every year at this time, that birthday is not one people actually want to celebrate. When we take a look at the reasons Americans aren't celebrating ObamaCare's sixth birthday, it is pretty obvious. Let's read them: unsecured data through the Web site, fewer provider choices, over $1 trillion in new taxes on American families, 2 million jobs' worth of hours lost, and skyrocketing premiums and deductibles. It is no surprise that the health care law continues to be very unpopular. Americans know that under the health care law they have less freedom to keep their doctor, to keep the insurance that was right for them and their families, because the President says he gets to decide what somebody needs for themselves and their families--not the families getting to decide for themselves. We know that--again, it came out during the break--people's personal data is not secure at healthcare.gov, as they thought it was. We know insurance companies are continuing to give patients fewer choices by limiting the networks of doctors that people can see. The health care law has added over $1 trillion in new taxes onto hardworking American families. Premiums and deductibles are up, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, ObamaCare is cutting the hours Americans can work by about 2 million jobs over the next decade. So it seems that every day there is more news coming out on how the health care law is unaffordable, unpopular, and unworkable. Last week there was a new study that explains one of the reasons why the President's health care law is collapsing. There was a study that came out from Blue Cross Blue Shield. It compared people buying new health insurance coverage in the ObamaCare exchanges to people who already had health insurance through their jobs. The study found that the new ObamaCare customers went to the doctor 26 percent more often than other people did, that they were admitted to the hospital almost twice as often, that ObamaCare customers have higher costs, and that the average medical spending is about $1,200 a year higher for people on ObamaCare than people who get their insurance through work. So why is it that hospital admissions are up so much for people who are on ObamaCare, and why is it that doctors' visits are up 26 percent? Because the new ObamaCare enrollees are sicker and costlier. So insurance companies of course have to raise their premiums. People are sicker who are signing up. They go to the doctor more. The insurance company turns around, and it raises premiums on everyone else. That is why so many people are opposed to the health care law--because the impact it has had on them personally. When insurance companies have to raise their rates on ObamaCare plans, a lot of money is paid by taxpayers because it is the taxpayers who are paying for the subsidies for all the folks who have signed up for ObamaCare. What we know is that taxpayers are subsidizing the premiums of 83 percent of the people who buy ObamaCare insurance. When the premiums go up, taxes have to be made up to pay for it. Well, when companies can't get enough extra money, they just stop offering policies. Under ObamaCare that may happen. Then more people will lose their insurance coverage. Maybe some companies will just go out of business. We are familiar with that process because we have seen it. We have seen that under the ObamaCare health care law, a majority of the ObamaCare health insurance co-ops have actually gone bankrupt. The health care law created 23 co-ops, and 12 have already gone out of business. Premiums were already out of control, and it is getting worse. The average premium for what is called the benchmark silver plan in the ObamaCare exchange is more than 7 percent higher this year than last year. For people who can only afford the cheaper bronze plan, premiums are up 13 percent compared to last year. Over the next couple of months, insurance companies are going to start setting their rates for 2017. They are going to take into account what has happened in the previous year. So this new study by Blue Cross Blue Shield is just laying the groundwork for even more price increases to come next year. I think this is one of the things that explains why so many people dislike ObamaCare. A new poll came out that found that 47 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the health care law. The Kaiser Family Foundation report shows Americans' opinion of ObamaCare is tilting negative--47 percent marked it unpopular in March of 2016. A year ago this poll said that 42 percent of the people had an unfavorable view. There we were a year ago. Here we are now. The number keeps climbing. Now only 41 percent of the people have a favorable view of the health care law. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Mr. President, 6 years ago Democrats in Washington were very confident that the law would be extremely popular today. As a matter of fact, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York went on ``Meet the Press'' back in 2010 and said: ``It is going to become more popular.'' He said: ``I predict that by November those who voted for the health care law will find it an asset.'' Well, we all remember what happened in the 2010 elections. We know that Democrats who voted for the health care law did not find it an asset. Democrats lost six seats in the Senate that year, and they lost control of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi was out as Speaker of the House, and the Republicans took the majority. Then in 2013, Senator Harry Reid was making this same prediction about how popular the health care law was going to be. He told the newspaper The [[Page S1658]] Hill in Washington that ObamaCare would be ``a net positive'' for Democrats in 2014. Senator Reid forced the health care law through Congress when he was the majority leader, and I think that is a big part of why he is now the minority leader. He lost the majority in the Senate. Why? I think in big part because of the health care law and the fact that it ignored the needs of the American people. The longer people have to live with this offensive and expensive law, the less popular it gets. It was never popular to begin with, but today, even more than before, the opinion is, as this poster says, ``tilting negative.'' The same poll also found something I found amazing. I have practiced medicine for 25 years, and I have been involved here in the Senate for a number of years. I have never seen anything like this. This new poll found that 28 percent of Americans say that this health care law has directly hurt them and their families. The President says: Defend and be proud of this law. How can you defend and be proud of something that 28 percent of the American public tells you has hurt them and their family personally? Only 18 percent in the poll said the law had directly helped them. It is incredible and it is disturbing. ObamaCare is hurting far more people than it is helping. Costs are going up much faster than Democrats promised, as are copays and deductibles. It is no wonder the law is unpopular. We know the health care law makes it more expensive for taxpayers--but how much more expensive? The Congressional Budget Office came out with a report last week. It said that over the next 10 years the health care law is going to cost $136 billion more than they thought it would cost just a year ago. When they compared what they thought it was going to cost a year ago and what they think it is going to cost now, it is $136 billion more. That is despite there being fewer people in the insurance exchanges than they expected. They predicted there would be 21 million people buying ObamaCare health insurance this year. In fact, they say it is going to be no more than 12 million. People are doing everything they can to avoid these insurance policies--especially young, healthy people. So why is it going to cost an extra $136 billion? One of the reasons is higher premiums, sicker patients, and because the law has dumped so many more people into Medicaid. About 23 percent of the people in the country under the age of 65 are now on Medicaid. That is what the Congressional Budget Office says--one out of every four. Is that a success--putting all these additional people on Medicaid? The President says it is. As a doctor who has practiced medicine and taken care of patients for over 25 years, putting additional people on Medicaid is not a success. It is not what people wanted, and it is not what President Obama promised. Americans deserve better. They deserve better than to be shoved into this second-tier health care system. Plus, in terms of government health care programs and wasting money, a recent study found that for every dollar spent on Medicaid, people only get about 20 to 40 cents on every dollar spent. How is that for an inefficient government system? Almost every day we get more information on the damage the health care law is doing to Americans across the country. Republicans have offered solutions that would actually keep the promises the Democrats made for ObamaCare, such as letting people keep their doctors and keep their insurance, giving more people options for how they can reduce their costs of medical care. Americans have now been forced to try this ObamaCare experiment--what the Democrats wanted--and forced to do it for the last 6 years. ObamaCare isn't getting any better. It is just getting older, and it is still making things worse for American families. That is why it is so unpopular. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today marks my 38th edition of ``Waste of the Week.'' With our Nation $19 trillion in debt, I am going to continue coming to the Senate floor every week the Senate is in session to highlight verified and documented examples of waste, fraud, and abuse. I turn to reports from nonpartisan organizations such as the Government Accountability Office which indicate that, thankfully, somebody is looking into how we run this government, coming up with examples of how we can run it better. They let the American people know that we are not wisely and carefully spending their taxpayer dollars, and, hopefully, we can take remedial action. Last year, I detailed an investigation by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the GAO, which discovered that fraudulent applications are being accepted by healthcare.gov. That is the government's health care Web site for choosing ObamaCare plans on the Federal exchange. Just last month, I discussed a new report from the GAO that outlined how healthcare.gov allowed people to sign up for and receive ObamaCare benefits without proper verification. They did a test. They made up some names, they filled out the application, they sent it in to healthcare.gov, and 11 out of the 12 test applications came back approved, with no verification whatsoever. Subsidies started going out to these people. Even after they were notified at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it took months to correct. Some people collected these subsidies; these fraudulent subsidies went somewhere. These were just made-up names. When we look at 11 out of 12, we have to say something is wrong with the system. And if we extrapolated that out, there could be a stunning number of fraudulent applications certified and subsidies sent to people that don't exist. Today I want to discuss even more ObamaCare problems. This one totals up to $1.16 billion worth of problems. We all know that the Affordable Care Act--which I call the Unaffordable Care Act, based on its operations so far--directed States to either develop their own State-based exchange to operate ObamaCare or to use the Federal exchange accessible at healthcare.gov. States had a choice about the action to take. But in order to try to get States to set up their own exchanges, the Obama Administration awarded billions of dollars in Federal grants to States if they agreed to plan and develop a State exchange. In 6 of the 14 States that chose to develop their own exchanges and receive these Federal grants--Maryland, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Mexico, and Nevada--the end results were disastrous. In fact, the GAO found that these State exchanges were given the green light without the systems ever being fully tested. For example, Maryland's exchange Web site had more than 600 unresolved defects, and Massachusetts had over 1100 unresolved defects. And yet the exchanges were given the go-ahead by the Obama Administration even though these unresolved defects were not realized and not addressed. In Oregon, a State exchange was set up by political operatives. Months after the enrollment period began, the online Oregon exchange couldn't enroll a single person, and applicants had to fax in their handwritten materials. Talk about a dysfunctional rollout. On this Senate floor we have talked about how, in the rush to prove that ObamaCare was what this country needed and that the government could efficiently and effectively run a health care system and in a rush to prove and get the thing up and going according to what the promises were, all kinds of mistakes were made. Oregon's abysmal failure cost taxpayers $305 million plus an additional $41 million that had to be spent to bring Oregon onto the Federal exchange. In other words, they failed to set up their State exchange and cost taxpayers $305 million. Then they had to spend another $41 million to transfer the system over to the Federal exchange. All totaled, the Federal government gave these six States $1.16 billion, and today none of these six States [[Page S1659]] are independently operating their own individual exchanges. This was a long time in the making. The nonpartisan GAO and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services raised concerns about these State exchanges more than a year before they were scheduled to launch. In other words, the warning went out, saying: You are not getting your act together. This was a year before the process started. We went through that whole year and they still didn't have their act together, and it ended up costing taxpayers $1.16 billion. It is no secret that the Obama Administration was in a rush to get this system up and going, and in the process, who knows how much money has been wasted? Who knows the trauma that people have gone through trying to sign up for these exchanges? I think we all remember the classic debacle that occurred in the whole software system and in the whole exchange system. People were calling in, they couldn't get anybody to answer the phone, and they couldn't get their applications fulfilled. All those promises, you know: Your premiums will not go up a penny. Count on that, the President said, period. Done deal. Take it to the bank. If you want your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Take it to the bank. I guarantee you that is what is going to happen. Costs will not go up. We have all seen deductibles shoot up. We have all seen premiums increase. People weren't able to keep the doctor they wanted. On and on it goes, and on and on it continues, and it is at the expense of the American taxpayer. Well, maybe it is not surprising. I am here every week, and I probably could come up here every day and maybe every hour and detail some waste of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. So today we are going to add more money to our growing list of waste, fraud, and abuse, taking us to $158,777,908,417. It just keeps adding up, and our colleagues have not taken the necessary action to try to tie the deal to these problems. Maybe government has become so overwhelmingly bureaucratic and dysfunctional that we are not able to run this country anymore in an efficient and effective manner. The problem is that we are asking people to go to work every day to put in a hard-earned number of hours earning pay and sending money to Washington, DC, only to find that it is wasted over and over and over. It is a relentless plunge into ever more debt because we don't have the money to pay for what we spend. Then we have to issue bonds in order to collect money, in order to pay for that. All of this falls to the taxpayer, and most of it is going to fall to future generations. They are going to have a limit on their ability to have the opportunity to make a viable living for themselves and for their children, and we wonder why the American people have lost faith in Washington's ability to carefully spend their hard-earned dollars. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to J. Thomas McGrady Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my wife Diana and I wish we could have been with Tom McGrady to mark the retirement of a good friend and a great legal warrior, Pinellas-Pasco Chief Judge J. Thomas McGrady. I am proud of Tom and his commitment to the law. Over the years he has compiled a tremendous record of success. Simply put, he has made a difference. It is probably unusual for a Senator from Wyoming to speak so highly of a retiring judge from Florida. Over the years, I have had a chance to come to know Tom. I feel honored to call him my friend, and, as often has been said, his departure from the bench will leave some large shoes to fill. Looking back, the script for Tom's life would have made a great movie. For starters, he was born on Christmas Eve. He turned out to be his parents' favorite Christmas gift. As he grew up and began to explore the world around him and develop his talents and abilities, his educational pursuits led him to another highlight of his life--high school--where he met and went on to marry his high school sweetheart, Mary Choquette. His interest in the law must have started around then because after graduating from the University of Florida with his bachelor's degree, he then got his juris doctorate degree there, and then joined a law firm and started practicing civil litigation. Before long he opened his own law firm. He practiced law for 25 years. He was so good that Governor Bush appointed him county judge. He was then appointed a circuit judge, again by Governor Bush. Whenever Tom ran for reelection, he won-- without opposition. People admired him and greatly appreciated his efforts on the bench so much that no one ran against him. Perhaps the best indication of his ability as a judge and the affection of those with whom he served was his unanimous election by 68 of his judge colleagues to chief judge 3 times. During Tom's service as chief judge, he discovered that with his election came a number of problems--Tom probably called them challenges--that came packaged together with his new duties. He had to deal with cuts to the court budget. He had to deal with a mortgage foreclosure crisis. He had to deal with a number of other issues. He was also working with a system that relied on old and outdated technologies, to name just a few of the matters that required his attention as chief judge. Probably the biggest problem was the shortage of funds to run the courts. Things were so bad that it looked as if drastic measures would have to be taken to keep the courts up and running. He came up with an option to obtain a loan from the Governor and the legislature. Without it, there would have been severe cuts, furloughs, and much more. He received a great reception when he shared the details of the problem with those who would be most affected--the judges and their staff. They appreciated his blunt assessment of how bad things were, as Tom put it, ``not because of what I had to say, but because I would even come and tell them.'' Tom is a straight shooter, and he knew that the best antidote for the impact of bad news was not to sugar coat it but to tell ``the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'' It also helped that Tom had established a reputation over the years for being a gentle man and a gentleman, and his honesty, sincerity, good humor, and concern for his colleagues and staffers earned him a lot of good will. Now that Tom has decided to retire and sit back, he will have more time to share with his family and friends. I know they will enjoy being with him and having more time to share with him, especially his grandchildren, who will love having ``Papa'' around a little more often. In the end, that is what it is all about--time. Time for faith, family, and friends. Time is the most valuable and precious asset we have, and how we choose to spend it and the quality of those activities that consume most of our time say a lot about the quality of our lives. I once heard about a guy who traveled around the world doing research on what people were thinking as they grew older. There were a lot of interesting thoughts they shared, but one of the most frequent comments was about spending more time with family. No one said: I wish I had spent more time at work. So, as the old film title says so well, Tom has already had a wonderful life, with so much more to come. He has made the most of every moment and every day. Mary, his sweetheart from his high school days, is still by his side, retired from her days as a schoolteacher. Now they will spend time enjoying all that life has to offer. Tom and Mary both truly earned it. Congratulations, Tom McGrady. You have been a great judge, and you made a difference in more lives than you will ever know. We can all learn a lot from you and the way you have lived your life. God bless you and Mary. Remembering Joseph Medicine Crow Mr. President, I rise to share the news with the Senate that Joseph Medicine Crow, a Crow war chief and American hero, has passed away. If you look in today's Washington Post you will [[Page S1660]] see something unusual--somebody from the West passing away and getting a major mention in the paper. Joe Medicine Crow did that, and he earned it in his 102 years. I know it meant a lot to the students of Western and American history to see the attention he has received, as numerous publications have written about him and his life and his countless contributions to the Crow people and to our Nation. If you have a chance to read the tributes to Joe Medicine Crow--and I hope you do--you will fully understand what an amazing individual he was. A historian for his people and an important part of American life, he accomplished more in his life than I could ever describe in these remarks. As I read the articles that were so well researched, they reminded me of meeting and getting to know him when he was on the board of All American Indian Days. That was a gathering that would draw tribal members from all over the United States to Sheridan, WY. They would come to share their history, their culture, their traditions, their sports, their dances, and their arts and crafts. I know that gathering meant a lot to him because one of his top priorities in his life was to ensure that the legacy of the Crow and all tribes would never be forgotten and that their way of life would be passed down from generation to generation. In an effort to bring us all together as one and overcome the racial divides that separate us, a man named F.H. Sinclair--a columnist for the Sheridan Press who was known by his nickname of ``Neckyoke Jones''--came up with the idea of gathering all the tribes together in Sheridan, WY, to demonstrate these talents and abilities. I grew up there, and I was fascinated by the event. As you can imagine, it took a substantial amount of money to organize and plan the event each year, but it paid big dividends for those who were able to attend and all those who heard about it. It was a source of great pride for us all to have this time when we would come together and celebrate the culture of the tribes and the individuals who were so near to us. It provided the kind of exposure and interaction that is so necessary to bring people together and overcome prejudice and bias. I could see the difference the gathering made and the impact it had on those who attended. Events like that and the opportunity they provide help us to get to know people who come from different cultures and backgrounds and help us to understand and appreciate each other. They remove the boundaries that are created by fear and a lack of understanding. They foster and increase the feeling of community that makes our cities and towns better places to live. I remember how Joe served on that board and helped with the Miss Indian American Pageant that was part of All American Indian Days. It was a competition of young women who were chosen by their tribes based on their knowledge of their tribal culture, their history, and their traditional dress. My mother, Dorothy Enzi, worked with Joe Medicine Crow and Suzie Yellowtail on the particulars that needed to be worked out to put on the pageant. My mother would then chaperone the winner to events during the year. Joe Medicine Crow had a great affection for Wyoming and a love of our land that was never surpassed. In addition to the Crow, Joe Medicine Crow was well known to the Wyoming Arapahos and Shoshones. In so many ways, Joe Medicine Crow was an ambassador for his tribe and his way of life. He was an inspiration to us all. Joe Medicine Crow referred to his life as living in two worlds. In one, he worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs for 32 years. Then he returned and fit right back into the other and the culture that surrounded him. It didn't bother him that his life was divided into two worlds. In fact, he said he enjoyed them both. The tributes to him and the way he lived his life have already started coming in from those who knew him, his family, and his friends. He was a military hero, having served in the Army in World War II. He was not only a student of history, he was a historian who helped to preserve the stories and the culture of the Crow. He also had a great respect for all the traditions of his people. I will always find a sense of pride and inspiration in the words he used to describe Wyoming. He said that although sage can be found in so many places in the West, the most sacred sage had to be collected on the tribal lands in Wyoming. Joe Medicine Crow was given 102 years of life, and he made the most of every day. He has a record of which we can be very proud. That is why I hope you will seek out the stories about him that made him such an important part of our history. In 2009 President Barack Obama presented him with the highest honor awarded to a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I know it must have meant a great deal to him to be so recognized--not for himself but for what he knew it would mean to current and future generations. Now he has passed on from this life and left behind more accomplishments and achievements than we could possibly imagine. His life was like that--102 years of making a difference every day, a difference that will always be remembered and never be forgotten. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Congratulating the Villanova Wildcats on Winning the 2016 NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I intend to address an amendment to the FAA authorization bill that Senator Casey and I are offering. But before I do that, I wish to take a quick moment to celebrate an amazing basketball game last night and an amazing victory for an amazing team, the Villanova Wildcats. It just made everyone in Pennsylvania so proud. They have had a fantastic season, a fantastic tournament, and last night I think we witnessed one of the greatest college basketball games ever. I know that is saying an awful lot. There have been a lot of college basketball games, but the game was unbelievable. We had two fantastic teams, extremely well matched, extremely talented, very well coached on both teams, and they just played phenomenally. I don't know how many times the lead changed. I don't think it ever got more than 10 points away from either team. It was just so much fun to watch, all the way through. I think Jay Wright has proven once again what a magnificent coach he is. The kids who played demonstrated just amazing teamwork and talent, and all of the attributes we want to see in college athletics we saw on display last night. I can't say enough about the University of North Carolina. What a great team they are. They played with so much heart and they played so well. I think we are going to watch the end of that game--the final 5 seconds of that game--for a long time to come. I will say when Marcus Paige took that shot, it looked to me like he was 20 feet behind the three-point line. He had almost been knocked over. He was airborne in a very odd and awkward position because he had just dodged another player. He got the shot off, and somehow it dropped. They tied the game, and there were 4.7 seconds left. At that point, I thought: Well, I am in for a late night because this is going to be the first of overtimes since it is tied with only 4.7 seconds left, but that was not the way it ended, as we know. The Wildcats had a plan and they executed it brilliantly with a great play to move the ball up the court quickly, to get it to Kris Jenkins, who put up a long three-point shot, and released it just before the buzzer went off. The buzzer went off while the ball was sailing through the air, sunk the basket, and won the game with no time left. It was the most dramatic and exciting finish to a basketball game that I can recall. I want to take this moment to congratulate the Villanova Wildcats on an outstanding season, tournament, and game last night. Congratulations to our new national champions. Mr. President, now let me turn my attention to the amendment I alluded to; that is, an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill. Senator Casey and I are going to offer as an amendment the legislation we have introduced as a freestanding bill, and that is the Saracini Aviation Safety Act of 2016. I thank Senator Casey for the very good work he has done on this issue for some time. Let me give a little bit of background on the amendment, which is based on [[Page S1661]] the legislation that is named after Victor Saracini. Victor Saracini was a Bucks County, PA, native. He was a Navy pilot. After he left the Navy, he became a commercial airline pilot. He was a captain. He was the captain of United Flight 175 which, as my colleagues will recall, was one of the planes that was captured by terrorists on 9/11. The fact is, Captain Saracini was murdered by the terrorists when they stormed the cockpit, took control of the plane, killed Victor Saracini, and then flew the plane into the World Trade Center. Victor Saracini left behind his wife Ellen, who is with us today in the Senate. She has been a very forceful and effective advocate for greater safety on board our commercial planes. Victor also left behind two daughters, Kirsten and Brielle. The amendment does something very simple. It requires a secondary barrier to the cockpit on commercial aircraft. That is all. That will prevent unauthorized individuals from getting into the cockpit. It is as simple as that. It is a simple, lightweight, inexpensive technology, readily available. It is actually made from a wire mesh, and it provides a barrier between the passenger cabin and the cockpit door. It would only be engaged when the cockpit door is open. So why is this necessary? It is necessary because it is still entirely possible for terrorists to hijack commercial aircraft. Back in 2001, after 9/11, Congress took a step to make commercial aircraft cockpits more secure. They mandated the installation of reinforced doors, and these reinforced doors are much stronger than the doors that used to exist. It is very difficult--almost impossible--to breach those doors when they are closed, but the threat remains because on every long flight and on many short flights the doors are open. At some point during the course of the flight, pilots often get up and they get out of the cockpit. They have to go to the restroom or they go to get some food or a flight attendant goes in to check on the pilots or to bring them something they want. That moment when that door is opened, that door is no longer a barrier. Therein lies the danger. There is the moment of opportunity for terrorists. The FAA fully acknowledges the serious nature of this risk. In April of 2015, an FAA advisory said the following: On long flights, as a matter of necessity, crewmembers must open the flight deck door to access lavatory facilities, to transfer meals to flightcrew members, or to switch crew positions for crew rest purposes. The opening and closing of the flight deck door (referred to as ``door transition''), reduces the protective anti-intrusion/anti-penetration benefits of the reinforced door. . . . During this door transition, the flight deck is vulnerable. Of course, it is not only the FAA that was able to figure this out. The terrorists understand this as well. The 9/11 Commission report said this: Ali Sheikh Mohammed told them-- And the ``them'' in this case refers to the terrorists he was instructing. Ali Sheikh Mohammed told them to watch the cabin doors at takeoff and landing to observe whether the captain went to the lavatory during the flight and to note whether the flight attendants brought food into the cockpit. I continue to quote: The best time to storm the cockpit would be about 10 to 15 minutes after takeoff when the cockpit doors typically were opened for the first time. Furthermore-- States the 9/11 Commission report-- they had no firm contingency plans-- ``They'' being the terrorists-- in case the cockpit door was locked. They were confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider breaking them down a viable idea. Since then, we have made the doors even more durable. It would be even more difficult to actually break down the door or otherwise open a closed door. The problem is when the door is open. This is not just a theoretical risk. Since 9/11, there have been at least 51 attempts at cockpit breaches worldwide. Five attempts have been successful. One successful attempt occurred in 2006 on Turkish Airlines Flight 1476. Terrorists were successful in entering the cockpit after a flight attendant opened the door to ask the pilots if they needed anything. So it seems to me unacceptable, when we have a readily available solution, to continue to take this risk. It is just common sense to install secondary barriers on commercial planes. These are inexpensive, several thousand dollars to install. They are lightweight and easy to use and very compact when they are not engaged. The only people who would be inconvenienced by these secondary barriers would be terrorists. Had the secondary barriers, these kinds of barriers, been installed on 9/11, it would have made the job very difficult for the terrorists to ever get into the cockpit. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think this is a sensible amendment. The substance of this has been approved in the House. We ought to pass it on the Senate floor and pass this FAA reauthorization underlying bill. If we do that, in time, our skies will be that much safer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa Proper Role of a Supreme Court Justice Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a significant number of Americans believe the Supreme Court is highly politicized. Its approval rating has fallen over the years, not surprisingly. Its approval rating has dropped most drastically in recent years following the President's appointment of Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. There are four Justices who vote in a liberal way in effectively every case the public follows. There are two Justices who stick to the constitutional text and who vote in a consistently conservative way. One Justice votes mostly, but not always, in a conservative way, and one Justice votes sometimes with the conservatives and sometimes with the liberals. All of the liberals were appointed by Democrats, the conservatives and swing Justices were appointed by a Republican President, but in a speech shortly before Justice Scalia's death, Chief Justice Roberts maintained that the public wrongly thinks Justices view themselves as Republicans or as Democrats. Of course, it is irrelevant to the public how the Justices view themselves. What is troubling is that a large segment of the population views the Justices as political. It is appropriate and instructive, then, to ask why the public takes this view and whether that view is warranted. I believe the public's perception is at least sometimes very warranted. The Chief Justice ruled out that this perception has anything to do with what the Justices themselves have done. Instead, he attributes it to the Senate confirmation process. As he sees it, Senators ``frequently ask us questions they know it would be inappropriate for us to answer. Thankfully, we don't answer the questions.'' The Chief Justice also stated: When you have a sharply divided political divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms. You know, if the Democrats and Republicans have been fighting so fiercely about whether you're going to be confirmed, it's natural for some members of the public to think, well, you must be identified in a particular way as a result of that process. On the one hand, the Chief Justice identified precisely why it would be bad for the Court and the nominee to move forward in the middle of a hotly contested Presidential election campaign. As you have heard this Senator say, it would be all politics and no Constitution. Of course, that was the thrust of another Senator a few years back--Chairman Biden's argument in 1992. But in another respect, the Chief Justice has it exactly backwards. The confirmation process doesn't make the Justices appear political. The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the Court itself has drifted from the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. In short, the Justices themselves have gotten political, and because the Justices' decisions are often political and transgress their constitutional role, the process becomes more political. In fact, many of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that the Chief Justice is part of this problem. They believe that a number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones. Certainly, there are academics who agree. [[Page S1662]] In a recent New York Times article, academics appealed to the Chief Justice's political side. These academics asked him to intervene in the current Supreme Court vacancy, suggesting that it could be a so-called John Marshall moment for Chief Justice Roberts. That is a political temptation that the Chief Justice should resist. I can't think of anything any current Justice could do to further damage respect for the Court at this moment than to interject themselves into what Chairman Biden called the political ``cauldron'' of an election year Supreme Court vacancy. In a recent speech, the Chief Justice said: ``We're interpreting the law, not imposing our views.'' He further stated: ``If people don't like the explanation, or don't think it holds together, you know, then they're justified, I think, in viewing us as having transgressed the limits of our role.'' Again, with all due respect to the Chief Justice, tens of millions of Americans believe, correctly, that the Supreme Court has transgressed the limits of its role. Tens of millions of Americans believe, correctly, that too many of the Justices are imposing their views and not interpreting the law. That is the major reason why we should have a debate about the proper role of a Supreme Court Justice. We need to debate whether our current Justices are adhering to their constitutional role. As the Chief Justice remarked, although many of the Supreme Court's decisions are unanimous or nearly so, the Justices tend to disagree on what the Chief Justice called, in his words, the ``hot button issues.'' We all know what kinds of cases he has in mind when he talks about ``hot button issues''--freedom of religion, abortion, affirmative action, gun control, free speech, and the death penalty. One can probably name a lot of others. The Chief Justice was very revealing when he acknowledged that the lesser known cases are often unanimous, and the hot button cases are frequently 5 to 4. But why is that? The law is no more or less likely to be clear in a hot button case than another case. For those Justices committed to the rule of law, it shouldn't be any harder to keep personal preferences out of a politically charged case than any other case. In some cases, the Justices are all willing to follow the law, but in others where they are deeply invested in the policy implications of the ruling, those cases tend to turn out 5 to 4. The explanation of these 5-to-4 rulings must be that in hot button cases some of the Justices are deciding based on their political preferences and not--as they should be--on the law. But if hot button cases are being decided by politicians in robes, then the Supreme Court has no more of a right than the voters to be the final word. The Chief Justice regrets that the American people believe the Court is no different from the political branches of government. But again, and with respect, I think he is concerned with the wrong problem. He would be well-served to address the reality--not the perception--that too often there is little difference between the actions of the Court and the actions of the political branches. So, Physician, heal thyself. In case after 5-to-4 case, the Justices who the Democrats appointed vote for liberal policy results. This can't be a coincidence. Democratic Presidents know what they want when they nominate Justices--Justices who will reach politically liberal results regardless of what the law requires. This, of course, is what our current President means when he says that he wants Justices to look to their ``heart'' to decide the really hard cases. That is an unambiguous invitation for Justices to decide the hot button cases based on personal policy preferences. That, of course, isn't the law, and it is not the appropriate role for the Court. It is no wonder, then, that the public believes the Court is political. What Democratic Presidents want in this regard is what they get--even before Justice Scalia's death. Leading scholars found this Supreme Court to be the most liberal since the 1960s. Justices appointed by Republicans are generally committed to following the law. There are Justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. But some of the Justices appointed even by Republicans often don't vote in a way that advances conservative policy. Contrary to what the Chief Justice suggested, a major reason the confirmation process has become more divisive is that some of the Justices are voting too often based on politics and not on law. If they are going to be political actors after they are confirmed, then the confirmation process necessarily is going to reflect that dynamic. For instance, just last week, after one of my Democratic colleagues met with Judge Garland, the Senator said after discussing issues like reproductive rights: ``I actually feel quite confident that he is deserving of my support.'' Obviously, I don't know what they discussed during that meeting or what Judge Garland said about reproductive rights, and, to be clear, I am not suggesting anything inappropriate was discussed. My point is this: If Justices stuck to the constitutional text and didn't base decisions on their own policy preferences or what the President asked, based on what is in their heart or on empathy for a particular litigant, then Senators wouldn't deem it necessary to understand whether the nominee supports reproductive rights or not. With this in mind, is it any wonder that the public believes the Court is political? If we want the confirmation process to be less divisive, if we want the public to have more confidence that the Justices haven't exceeded their constitutional role, then the Justices themselves need to demonstrate that in politically sensitive cases their decisions are based on the Constitution and the law and not on political preferences or what comes from the heart or because of some empathy. So here is where we are about the public perception of the Court being political. When the Justices return to their appropriate role of deciding cases based on the facts and the law, public perception of the Court will take care of itself. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1655-S1662] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED-- Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes as in morning business. [[Page S1656]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for my 132nd ``Time to Wake Up'' speech. We are now back from recess, and while we were away, one little thing and three really big things happened. The little thing has to do with the so-called war on coal which we have heard so much nonsense about in this Chamber. There was this article, which I am showing on this chart, saying: ``Natural gas has been waging a war on coal for more than a decade, and this is the year it plants the flag.'' Natural gas has been waging a war on coal. Not Obama. Not liberals. Natural gas. The article predicts a resulting ``wave'' of coal plant retirements. Who wrote this? Some green, lefty publication? Actually, it was the Wall Street Journal news department. So as coal companies go bankrupt left and right, there is the coal story. Natural gas has been waging war on coal for more than a decade. Spinning this against the President has been easy politics, but false, and that false political strategy has left coal country with what? Nothing. A carbon fee could produce revenues that could power wealth into coal country, but, no, what they got instead was someone to blame--someone to blame wrongly. Great job. Now to the three big things that happened during our recess. First, a group of very distinguished scientists, led by legendary climate scientist Dr. James Hansen, warned us that this climate change thing is likely to be a lot worse than we thought. Their sweeping synthesis, which underwent an involved and public peer-review process, suggests the possibility of greater sea level rise in this century than forecast. It suggests, worse, even epic storms, and it posits ``losing functionality of all coastal cities.'' How about that for a phrase? They go on to conclude, obviously, that ``the economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable.'' That was one. Second is the Great Barrier Reef, a wonder of the world, hit by the worst coral bleaching ever measured. For those of my colleagues who don't know, uplanders who may not understand what coral bleaching is, it is like cardiac arrest for coral. You are not necessarily dead yet, but there is a very good chance you will be, and for sure you are in serious trouble and you will need time to recover. That is what is happening in the Great Barrier Reef. The third thing is a new study out of UMass and Penn State which found that the expected loss of Antarctic ice ``nearly doubles'' prior estimates of sea level rise. I am from an ocean State. I am from Rhode Island, the Ocean State. This is consequential. How consequential? Here is what one of the authors of the study said: ``You're remapping the way the planet looks from space with those numbers, not just subtle changes about which neighborhoods are going to be susceptible to storm surge,'' but remapping the way the planet looks from space. Of course, CO 2 levels continue to exceed 400 parts per million against a human history where they were always between 170 and 300 until the industrial era drove it up. So that is not great news, but here is what is sickening about it. We don't seem to care here. It has all been in the news. Senators read the news. It is not like we are being deprived of information. We just as an institution do not care. That is a defect. That makes us a defective institution, not to be able to receive and process information like this. This is institutional failure, and we don't even care about that because one might say: You know, I don't really care myself about all of this damage, but as a Member of this body, I get that the U.S. Senate ought to care institutionally. It is like secondary caring. I will do my duty. Even if I personally don't care about oceans or reefs or coasts or storms, I am in. I am in, even though it is not my thing, because I know it is important. But we don't even do that. So we really don't care. Why? Why would we be so blind? We are not all terrible people. Some of us actually spend time outdoors and profess to care about nature. So why does the Senate, as a body collectively, not give a hoot? It is a deadly combination of politics and money. That is what investigation and history will show, and the investigations are underway. The history will not be pretty. We are surrounded by money. Senators exist in a world of money the way fish exist in a world of water. We are so accustomed to it, we barely even notice it. Hundreds of millions of dollars every year in lobbying money surround us. Hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money every election have to be raised. Hundreds of millions in PAC money pours in and exerts its influence, and we don't even know how much dark money there is flowing around through loopholes the size of the Holland Tunnel. Just one--one--dark money group is spending $750 million in the 2016 elections. It is a disgrace, but it has an effect. The interests that spend hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying us want things. The interests who give hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money want things. The PACs and the super PACs pointing $750 million in political artillery at us, they want things. Some want ideological things, but most want money. More exactly, they want things we can do that can be turned into money: licenses, tax breaks, trade advantages, regulations, relief from regulations. You name it, they want it because they can turn it into money. All of that has a desensitizing effect on our values here. If something can't be monetized, we get trained not to care about it. Values that aren't monetized in the marketplace start to seem weird. Who cares about a reef? What is that weird Senator doing talking about a reef? What a silly thing to talk about in our serious world. Now, someone's favorable fat cat tax rate, that is important. Jerking around a perfectly qualified Supreme Court nominee, that is definitely important, but the greatest crisis facing the natural world as we know it, no. And we go along. We go along with that warped value system. It is a lie. It is a moral lie so big it envelopes us, and we acclimate to it. All that money around us slowly anesthetizes our moral and natural senses, and that is how this place becomes Mammon Hall. It is actually even worse than that. It is not just that if you can't cash it in, it doesn't matter around here. It is that big, greedy special interests come here to plunder, and we let them. We let them, and we even help them because we become dependent on their money. Well, I have a proposition. Years ago, one of the Koch brothers, America's biggest polluters, ran for Vice President as a Libertarian Party candidate. When he ran, he learned something. He learned the perverse math of third parties in a two-party system. The perverse math of third parties in a two-party system is that you only hurt the ones you love. You hurt the party you are closest to by your third party taking votes away from the party closest to your politics. Well, the Kochs may be a lot of things, but they aren't stupid, and I think they learned. They learned that a creepy far-right third party that could be put in tow to big polluters was not the right method to achieve their purposes. There was a smarter method. Invade the Republican Party, that Grand Old Party of Theodore Roosevelt, capture it, turn it into the far-right party of their dreams. That was the smart play. Money and secrecy could make it happen, and they are pretty close to having done it. The Republican Party in Congress is as dependent on fossil fuel and polluter money now as a deep sea diver is on his air hose. Cut the airhose or pinch the flow, and we have a diver in real distress. When you control a deep sea diver's airhose, he becomes a pretty obedient diver. It is a form of the Golden Rule: He who wields the gold makes the rules. The political press, by the way, does little to help. It is a game to them. Who will say something appalling we can chatter about on the talk shows? Who is up? Who is down? Who said what about whom? It is akin to a soccer team of 7-year-olds. Most everybody runs to the ball or whatever the shiny object of the moment is, and in the midst of them are outfits that masquerade as the political press, but they are really polluter PR fronts in disguise. They, too, are in tow to the fossil fuel industry. Money and secrecy have their way. [[Page S1657]] So here we are in the Senate, in the face of this news that came to us over the recess, ineffective, defective, idly paying no attention to what is really important as we chase political trifles around, making a mockery of our great American democratic experiment. Well, folks, people are going to notice. This climate mess we have created is only going in one direction. When everybody has noticed, when it is way past denying, elected officials who refused to even look at the problem are going to look pretty foolish, and they are going to have to explain. Well, you see, I thought there was this big hoax. Really. Yes, I thought NASA's scientists and NOAA's scientists were all in on it, along with the U.S. Navy and every National Lab we fund. Hum. That is a big hoax. Oh, did I forget to mention my home State university must have been in on the hoax too? They were all studying climate change effects actually happening in my home State, but I knew better. Great. And every major legitimate American scientific society and most of my home State corporate leaders--I figured they were all wrong. Oh, OK, and where did you get that idea? Oh, from a bunch of guys with financial ties to the polluters. Come on--seriously? Didn't you think that was a pretty obvious conflict of interest? Wow, is that something I should have thought of? But listen. Now I want you to reelect me because I am such a good, prudent, and responsible decisionmaker. Folks, good luck with that. If you think the Republican Party is in trouble now, wait until the day of reckoning comes on climate change. Explain the money. Explain the money. You don't think people are going to figure out how it works? Explain the talk show science you believe instead of the peer-reviewed stuff. Explain the quality of your due diligence into the science. Good luck with that. Explain why you thought NASA, which is driving a rover around on the surface of Mars that they flew there and safely landed--that is probably the greatest scientific and mechanical achievement of our time. They did that, but you say they were part of a hoax on climate change. Really? By the way, I think people here actually owe NASA an apology for saying such nonsense about them, but that is for another day. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming. ObamaCare Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago was the sixth anniversary of President Obama's unpopular health care law. Every year at this time, that birthday is not one people actually want to celebrate. When we take a look at the reasons Americans aren't celebrating ObamaCare's sixth birthday, it is pretty obvious. Let's read them: unsecured data through the Web site, fewer provider choices, over $1 trillion in new taxes on American families, 2 million jobs' worth of hours lost, and skyrocketing premiums and deductibles. It is no surprise that the health care law continues to be very unpopular. Americans know that under the health care law they have less freedom to keep their doctor, to keep the insurance that was right for them and their families, because the President says he gets to decide what somebody needs for themselves and their families--not the families getting to decide for themselves. We know that--again, it came out during the break--people's personal data is not secure at healthcare.gov, as they thought it was. We know insurance companies are continuing to give patients fewer choices by limiting the networks of doctors that people can see. The health care law has added over $1 trillion in new taxes onto hardworking American families. Premiums and deductibles are up, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, ObamaCare is cutting the hours Americans can work by about 2 million jobs over the next decade. So it seems that every day there is more news coming out on how the health care law is unaffordable, unpopular, and unworkable. Last week there was a new study that explains one of the reasons why the President's health care law is collapsing. There was a study that came out from Blue Cross Blue Shield. It compared people buying new health insurance coverage in the ObamaCare exchanges to people who already had health insurance through their jobs. The study found that the new ObamaCare customers went to the doctor 26 percent more often than other people did, that they were admitted to the hospital almost twice as often, that ObamaCare customers have higher costs, and that the average medical spending is about $1,200 a year higher for people on ObamaCare than people who get their insurance through work. So why is it that hospital admissions are up so much for people who are on ObamaCare, and why is it that doctors' visits are up 26 percent? Because the new ObamaCare enrollees are sicker and costlier. So insurance companies of course have to raise their premiums. People are sicker who are signing up. They go to the doctor more. The insurance company turns around, and it raises premiums on everyone else. That is why so many people are opposed to the health care law--because the impact it has had on them personally. When insurance companies have to raise their rates on ObamaCare plans, a lot of money is paid by taxpayers because it is the taxpayers who are paying for the subsidies for all the folks who have signed up for ObamaCare. What we know is that taxpayers are subsidizing the premiums of 83 percent of the people who buy ObamaCare insurance. When the premiums go up, taxes have to be made up to pay for it. Well, when companies can't get enough extra money, they just stop offering policies. Under ObamaCare that may happen. Then more people will lose their insurance coverage. Maybe some companies will just go out of business. We are familiar with that process because we have seen it. We have seen that under the ObamaCare health care law, a majority of the ObamaCare health insurance co-ops have actually gone bankrupt. The health care law created 23 co-ops, and 12 have already gone out of business. Premiums were already out of control, and it is getting worse. The average premium for what is called the benchmark silver plan in the ObamaCare exchange is more than 7 percent higher this year than last year. For people who can only afford the cheaper bronze plan, premiums are up 13 percent compared to last year. Over the next couple of months, insurance companies are going to start setting their rates for 2017. They are going to take into account what has happened in the previous year. So this new study by Blue Cross Blue Shield is just laying the groundwork for even more price increases to come next year. I think this is one of the things that explains why so many people dislike ObamaCare. A new poll came out that found that 47 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the health care law. The Kaiser Family Foundation report shows Americans' opinion of ObamaCare is tilting negative--47 percent marked it unpopular in March of 2016. A year ago this poll said that 42 percent of the people had an unfavorable view. There we were a year ago. Here we are now. The number keeps climbing. Now only 41 percent of the people have a favorable view of the health care law. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Mr. President, 6 years ago Democrats in Washington were very confident that the law would be extremely popular today. As a matter of fact, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York went on ``Meet the Press'' back in 2010 and said: ``It is going to become more popular.'' He said: ``I predict that by November those who voted for the health care law will find it an asset.'' Well, we all remember what happened in the 2010 elections. We know that Democrats who voted for the health care law did not find it an asset. Democrats lost six seats in the Senate that year, and they lost control of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi was out as Speaker of the House, and the Republicans took the majority. Then in 2013, Senator Harry Reid was making this same prediction about how popular the health care law was going to be. He told the newspaper The [[Page S1658]] Hill in Washington that ObamaCare would be ``a net positive'' for Democrats in 2014. Senator Reid forced the health care law through Congress when he was the majority leader, and I think that is a big part of why he is now the minority leader. He lost the majority in the Senate. Why? I think in big part because of the health care law and the fact that it ignored the needs of the American people. The longer people have to live with this offensive and expensive law, the less popular it gets. It was never popular to begin with, but today, even more than before, the opinion is, as this poster says, ``tilting negative.'' The same poll also found something I found amazing. I have practiced medicine for 25 years, and I have been involved here in the Senate for a number of years. I have never seen anything like this. This new poll found that 28 percent of Americans say that this health care law has directly hurt them and their families. The President says: Defend and be proud of this law. How can you defend and be proud of something that 28 percent of the American public tells you has hurt them and their family personally? Only 18 percent in the poll said the law had directly helped them. It is incredible and it is disturbing. ObamaCare is hurting far more people than it is helping. Costs are going up much faster than Democrats promised, as are copays and deductibles. It is no wonder the law is unpopular. We know the health care law makes it more expensive for taxpayers--but how much more expensive? The Congressional Budget Office came out with a report last week. It said that over the next 10 years the health care law is going to cost $136 billion more than they thought it would cost just a year ago. When they compared what they thought it was going to cost a year ago and what they think it is going to cost now, it is $136 billion more. That is despite there being fewer people in the insurance exchanges than they expected. They predicted there would be 21 million people buying ObamaCare health insurance this year. In fact, they say it is going to be no more than 12 million. People are doing everything they can to avoid these insurance policies--especially young, healthy people. So why is it going to cost an extra $136 billion? One of the reasons is higher premiums, sicker patients, and because the law has dumped so many more people into Medicaid. About 23 percent of the people in the country under the age of 65 are now on Medicaid. That is what the Congressional Budget Office says--one out of every four. Is that a success--putting all these additional people on Medicaid? The President says it is. As a doctor who has practiced medicine and taken care of patients for over 25 years, putting additional people on Medicaid is not a success. It is not what people wanted, and it is not what President Obama promised. Americans deserve better. They deserve better than to be shoved into this second-tier health care system. Plus, in terms of government health care programs and wasting money, a recent study found that for every dollar spent on Medicaid, people only get about 20 to 40 cents on every dollar spent. How is that for an inefficient government system? Almost every day we get more information on the damage the health care law is doing to Americans across the country. Republicans have offered solutions that would actually keep the promises the Democrats made for ObamaCare, such as letting people keep their doctors and keep their insurance, giving more people options for how they can reduce their costs of medical care. Americans have now been forced to try this ObamaCare experiment--what the Democrats wanted--and forced to do it for the last 6 years. ObamaCare isn't getting any better. It is just getting older, and it is still making things worse for American families. That is why it is so unpopular. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today marks my 38th edition of ``Waste of the Week.'' With our Nation $19 trillion in debt, I am going to continue coming to the Senate floor every week the Senate is in session to highlight verified and documented examples of waste, fraud, and abuse. I turn to reports from nonpartisan organizations such as the Government Accountability Office which indicate that, thankfully, somebody is looking into how we run this government, coming up with examples of how we can run it better. They let the American people know that we are not wisely and carefully spending their taxpayer dollars, and, hopefully, we can take remedial action. Last year, I detailed an investigation by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the GAO, which discovered that fraudulent applications are being accepted by healthcare.gov. That is the government's health care Web site for choosing ObamaCare plans on the Federal exchange. Just last month, I discussed a new report from the GAO that outlined how healthcare.gov allowed people to sign up for and receive ObamaCare benefits without proper verification. They did a test. They made up some names, they filled out the application, they sent it in to healthcare.gov, and 11 out of the 12 test applications came back approved, with no verification whatsoever. Subsidies started going out to these people. Even after they were notified at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it took months to correct. Some people collected these subsidies; these fraudulent subsidies went somewhere. These were just made-up names. When we look at 11 out of 12, we have to say something is wrong with the system. And if we extrapolated that out, there could be a stunning number of fraudulent applications certified and subsidies sent to people that don't exist. Today I want to discuss even more ObamaCare problems. This one totals up to $1.16 billion worth of problems. We all know that the Affordable Care Act--which I call the Unaffordable Care Act, based on its operations so far--directed States to either develop their own State-based exchange to operate ObamaCare or to use the Federal exchange accessible at healthcare.gov. States had a choice about the action to take. But in order to try to get States to set up their own exchanges, the Obama Administration awarded billions of dollars in Federal grants to States if they agreed to plan and develop a State exchange. In 6 of the 14 States that chose to develop their own exchanges and receive these Federal grants--Maryland, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Mexico, and Nevada--the end results were disastrous. In fact, the GAO found that these State exchanges were given the green light without the systems ever being fully tested. For example, Maryland's exchange Web site had more than 600 unresolved defects, and Massachusetts had over 1100 unresolved defects. And yet the exchanges were given the go-ahead by the Obama Administration even though these unresolved defects were not realized and not addressed. In Oregon, a State exchange was set up by political operatives. Months after the enrollment period began, the online Oregon exchange couldn't enroll a single person, and applicants had to fax in their handwritten materials. Talk about a dysfunctional rollout. On this Senate floor we have talked about how, in the rush to prove that ObamaCare was what this country needed and that the government could efficiently and effectively run a health care system and in a rush to prove and get the thing up and going according to what the promises were, all kinds of mistakes were made. Oregon's abysmal failure cost taxpayers $305 million plus an additional $41 million that had to be spent to bring Oregon onto the Federal exchange. In other words, they failed to set up their State exchange and cost taxpayers $305 million. Then they had to spend another $41 million to transfer the system over to the Federal exchange. All totaled, the Federal government gave these six States $1.16 billion, and today none of these six States [[Page S1659]] are independently operating their own individual exchanges. This was a long time in the making. The nonpartisan GAO and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services raised concerns about these State exchanges more than a year before they were scheduled to launch. In other words, the warning went out, saying: You are not getting your act together. This was a year before the process started. We went through that whole year and they still didn't have their act together, and it ended up costing taxpayers $1.16 billion. It is no secret that the Obama Administration was in a rush to get this system up and going, and in the process, who knows how much money has been wasted? Who knows the trauma that people have gone through trying to sign up for these exchanges? I think we all remember the classic debacle that occurred in the whole software system and in the whole exchange system. People were calling in, they couldn't get anybody to answer the phone, and they couldn't get their applications fulfilled. All those promises, you know: Your premiums will not go up a penny. Count on that, the President said, period. Done deal. Take it to the bank. If you want your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Take it to the bank. I guarantee you that is what is going to happen. Costs will not go up. We have all seen deductibles shoot up. We have all seen premiums increase. People weren't able to keep the doctor they wanted. On and on it goes, and on and on it continues, and it is at the expense of the American taxpayer. Well, maybe it is not surprising. I am here every week, and I probably could come up here every day and maybe every hour and detail some waste of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. So today we are going to add more money to our growing list of waste, fraud, and abuse, taking us to $158,777,908,417. It just keeps adding up, and our colleagues have not taken the necessary action to try to tie the deal to these problems. Maybe government has become so overwhelmingly bureaucratic and dysfunctional that we are not able to run this country anymore in an efficient and effective manner. The problem is that we are asking people to go to work every day to put in a hard-earned number of hours earning pay and sending money to Washington, DC, only to find that it is wasted over and over and over. It is a relentless plunge into ever more debt because we don't have the money to pay for what we spend. Then we have to issue bonds in order to collect money, in order to pay for that. All of this falls to the taxpayer, and most of it is going to fall to future generations. They are going to have a limit on their ability to have the opportunity to make a viable living for themselves and for their children, and we wonder why the American people have lost faith in Washington's ability to carefully spend their hard-earned dollars. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to J. Thomas McGrady Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my wife Diana and I wish we could have been with Tom McGrady to mark the retirement of a good friend and a great legal warrior, Pinellas-Pasco Chief Judge J. Thomas McGrady. I am proud of Tom and his commitment to the law. Over the years he has compiled a tremendous record of success. Simply put, he has made a difference. It is probably unusual for a Senator from Wyoming to speak so highly of a retiring judge from Florida. Over the years, I have had a chance to come to know Tom. I feel honored to call him my friend, and, as often has been said, his departure from the bench will leave some large shoes to fill. Looking back, the script for Tom's life would have made a great movie. For starters, he was born on Christmas Eve. He turned out to be his parents' favorite Christmas gift. As he grew up and began to explore the world around him and develop his talents and abilities, his educational pursuits led him to another highlight of his life--high school--where he met and went on to marry his high school sweetheart, Mary Choquette. His interest in the law must have started around then because after graduating from the University of Florida with his bachelor's degree, he then got his juris doctorate degree there, and then joined a law firm and started practicing civil litigation. Before long he opened his own law firm. He practiced law for 25 years. He was so good that Governor Bush appointed him county judge. He was then appointed a circuit judge, again by Governor Bush. Whenever Tom ran for reelection, he won-- without opposition. People admired him and greatly appreciated his efforts on the bench so much that no one ran against him. Perhaps the best indication of his ability as a judge and the affection of those with whom he served was his unanimous election by 68 of his judge colleagues to chief judge 3 times. During Tom's service as chief judge, he discovered that with his election came a number of problems--Tom probably called them challenges--that came packaged together with his new duties. He had to deal with cuts to the court budget. He had to deal with a mortgage foreclosure crisis. He had to deal with a number of other issues. He was also working with a system that relied on old and outdated technologies, to name just a few of the matters that required his attention as chief judge. Probably the biggest problem was the shortage of funds to run the courts. Things were so bad that it looked as if drastic measures would have to be taken to keep the courts up and running. He came up with an option to obtain a loan from the Governor and the legislature. Without it, there would have been severe cuts, furloughs, and much more. He received a great reception when he shared the details of the problem with those who would be most affected--the judges and their staff. They appreciated his blunt assessment of how bad things were, as Tom put it, ``not because of what I had to say, but because I would even come and tell them.'' Tom is a straight shooter, and he knew that the best antidote for the impact of bad news was not to sugar coat it but to tell ``the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'' It also helped that Tom had established a reputation over the years for being a gentle man and a gentleman, and his honesty, sincerity, good humor, and concern for his colleagues and staffers earned him a lot of good will. Now that Tom has decided to retire and sit back, he will have more time to share with his family and friends. I know they will enjoy being with him and having more time to share with him, especially his grandchildren, who will love having ``Papa'' around a little more often. In the end, that is what it is all about--time. Time for faith, family, and friends. Time is the most valuable and precious asset we have, and how we choose to spend it and the quality of those activities that consume most of our time say a lot about the quality of our lives. I once heard about a guy who traveled around the world doing research on what people were thinking as they grew older. There were a lot of interesting thoughts they shared, but one of the most frequent comments was about spending more time with family. No one said: I wish I had spent more time at work. So, as the old film title says so well, Tom has already had a wonderful life, with so much more to come. He has made the most of every moment and every day. Mary, his sweetheart from his high school days, is still by his side, retired from her days as a schoolteacher. Now they will spend time enjoying all that life has to offer. Tom and Mary both truly earned it. Congratulations, Tom McGrady. You have been a great judge, and you made a difference in more lives than you will ever know. We can all learn a lot from you and the way you have lived your life. God bless you and Mary. Remembering Joseph Medicine Crow Mr. President, I rise to share the news with the Senate that Joseph Medicine Crow, a Crow war chief and American hero, has passed away. If you look in today's Washington Post you will [[Page S1660]] see something unusual--somebody from the West passing away and getting a major mention in the paper. Joe Medicine Crow did that, and he earned it in his 102 years. I know it meant a lot to the students of Western and American history to see the attention he has received, as numerous publications have written about him and his life and his countless contributions to the Crow people and to our Nation. If you have a chance to read the tributes to Joe Medicine Crow--and I hope you do--you will fully understand what an amazing individual he was. A historian for his people and an important part of American life, he accomplished more in his life than I could ever describe in these remarks. As I read the articles that were so well researched, they reminded me of meeting and getting to know him when he was on the board of All American Indian Days. That was a gathering that would draw tribal members from all over the United States to Sheridan, WY. They would come to share their history, their culture, their traditions, their sports, their dances, and their arts and crafts. I know that gathering meant a lot to him because one of his top priorities in his life was to ensure that the legacy of the Crow and all tribes would never be forgotten and that their way of life would be passed down from generation to generation. In an effort to bring us all together as one and overcome the racial divides that separate us, a man named F.H. Sinclair--a columnist for the Sheridan Press who was known by his nickname of ``Neckyoke Jones''--came up with the idea of gathering all the tribes together in Sheridan, WY, to demonstrate these talents and abilities. I grew up there, and I was fascinated by the event. As you can imagine, it took a substantial amount of money to organize and plan the event each year, but it paid big dividends for those who were able to attend and all those who heard about it. It was a source of great pride for us all to have this time when we would come together and celebrate the culture of the tribes and the individuals who were so near to us. It provided the kind of exposure and interaction that is so necessary to bring people together and overcome prejudice and bias. I could see the difference the gathering made and the impact it had on those who attended. Events like that and the opportunity they provide help us to get to know people who come from different cultures and backgrounds and help us to understand and appreciate each other. They remove the boundaries that are created by fear and a lack of understanding. They foster and increase the feeling of community that makes our cities and towns better places to live. I remember how Joe served on that board and helped with the Miss Indian American Pageant that was part of All American Indian Days. It was a competition of young women who were chosen by their tribes based on their knowledge of their tribal culture, their history, and their traditional dress. My mother, Dorothy Enzi, worked with Joe Medicine Crow and Suzie Yellowtail on the particulars that needed to be worked out to put on the pageant. My mother would then chaperone the winner to events during the year. Joe Medicine Crow had a great affection for Wyoming and a love of our land that was never surpassed. In addition to the Crow, Joe Medicine Crow was well known to the Wyoming Arapahos and Shoshones. In so many ways, Joe Medicine Crow was an ambassador for his tribe and his way of life. He was an inspiration to us all. Joe Medicine Crow referred to his life as living in two worlds. In one, he worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs for 32 years. Then he returned and fit right back into the other and the culture that surrounded him. It didn't bother him that his life was divided into two worlds. In fact, he said he enjoyed them both. The tributes to him and the way he lived his life have already started coming in from those who knew him, his family, and his friends. He was a military hero, having served in the Army in World War II. He was not only a student of history, he was a historian who helped to preserve the stories and the culture of the Crow. He also had a great respect for all the traditions of his people. I will always find a sense of pride and inspiration in the words he used to describe Wyoming. He said that although sage can be found in so many places in the West, the most sacred sage had to be collected on the tribal lands in Wyoming. Joe Medicine Crow was given 102 years of life, and he made the most of every day. He has a record of which we can be very proud. That is why I hope you will seek out the stories about him that made him such an important part of our history. In 2009 President Barack Obama presented him with the highest honor awarded to a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I know it must have meant a great deal to him to be so recognized--not for himself but for what he knew it would mean to current and future generations. Now he has passed on from this life and left behind more accomplishments and achievements than we could possibly imagine. His life was like that--102 years of making a difference every day, a difference that will always be remembered and never be forgotten. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Congratulating the Villanova Wildcats on Winning the 2016 NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I intend to address an amendment to the FAA authorization bill that Senator Casey and I are offering. But before I do that, I wish to take a quick moment to celebrate an amazing basketball game last night and an amazing victory for an amazing team, the Villanova Wildcats. It just made everyone in Pennsylvania so proud. They have had a fantastic season, a fantastic tournament, and last night I think we witnessed one of the greatest college basketball games ever. I know that is saying an awful lot. There have been a lot of college basketball games, but the game was unbelievable. We had two fantastic teams, extremely well matched, extremely talented, very well coached on both teams, and they just played phenomenally. I don't know how many times the lead changed. I don't think it ever got more than 10 points away from either team. It was just so much fun to watch, all the way through. I think Jay Wright has proven once again what a magnificent coach he is. The kids who played demonstrated just amazing teamwork and talent, and all of the attributes we want to see in college athletics we saw on display last night. I can't say enough about the University of North Carolina. What a great team they are. They played with so much heart and they played so well. I think we are going to watch the end of that game--the final 5 seconds of that game--for a long time to come. I will say when Marcus Paige took that shot, it looked to me like he was 20 feet behind the three-point line. He had almost been knocked over. He was airborne in a very odd and awkward position because he had just dodged another player. He got the shot off, and somehow it dropped. They tied the game, and there were 4.7 seconds left. At that point, I thought: Well, I am in for a late night because this is going to be the first of overtimes since it is tied with only 4.7 seconds left, but that was not the way it ended, as we know. The Wildcats had a plan and they executed it brilliantly with a great play to move the ball up the court quickly, to get it to Kris Jenkins, who put up a long three-point shot, and released it just before the buzzer went off. The buzzer went off while the ball was sailing through the air, sunk the basket, and won the game with no time left. It was the most dramatic and exciting finish to a basketball game that I can recall. I want to take this moment to congratulate the Villanova Wildcats on an outstanding season, tournament, and game last night. Congratulations to our new national champions. Mr. President, now let me turn my attention to the amendment I alluded to; that is, an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill. Senator Casey and I are going to offer as an amendment the legislation we have introduced as a freestanding bill, and that is the Saracini Aviation Safety Act of 2016. I thank Senator Casey for the very good work he has done on this issue for some time. Let me give a little bit of background on the amendment, which is based on [[Page S1661]] the legislation that is named after Victor Saracini. Victor Saracini was a Bucks County, PA, native. He was a Navy pilot. After he left the Navy, he became a commercial airline pilot. He was a captain. He was the captain of United Flight 175 which, as my colleagues will recall, was one of the planes that was captured by terrorists on 9/11. The fact is, Captain Saracini was murdered by the terrorists when they stormed the cockpit, took control of the plane, killed Victor Saracini, and then flew the plane into the World Trade Center. Victor Saracini left behind his wife Ellen, who is with us today in the Senate. She has been a very forceful and effective advocate for greater safety on board our commercial planes. Victor also left behind two daughters, Kirsten and Brielle. The amendment does something very simple. It requires a secondary barrier to the cockpit on commercial aircraft. That is all. That will prevent unauthorized individuals from getting into the cockpit. It is as simple as that. It is a simple, lightweight, inexpensive technology, readily available. It is actually made from a wire mesh, and it provides a barrier between the passenger cabin and the cockpit door. It would only be engaged when the cockpit door is open. So why is this necessary? It is necessary because it is still entirely possible for terrorists to hijack commercial aircraft. Back in 2001, after 9/11, Congress took a step to make commercial aircraft cockpits more secure. They mandated the installation of reinforced doors, and these reinforced doors are much stronger than the doors that used to exist. It is very difficult--almost impossible--to breach those doors when they are closed, but the threat remains because on every long flight and on many short flights the doors are open. At some point during the course of the flight, pilots often get up and they get out of the cockpit. They have to go to the restroom or they go to get some food or a flight attendant goes in to check on the pilots or to bring them something they want. That moment when that door is opened, that door is no longer a barrier. Therein lies the danger. There is the moment of opportunity for terrorists. The FAA fully acknowledges the serious nature of this risk. In April of 2015, an FAA advisory said the following: On long flights, as a matter of necessity, crewmembers must open the flight deck door to access lavatory facilities, to transfer meals to flightcrew members, or to switch crew positions for crew rest purposes. The opening and closing of the flight deck door (referred to as ``door transition''), reduces the protective anti-intrusion/anti-penetration benefits of the reinforced door. . . . During this door transition, the flight deck is vulnerable. Of course, it is not only the FAA that was able to figure this out. The terrorists understand this as well. The 9/11 Commission report said this: Ali Sheikh Mohammed told them-- And the ``them'' in this case refers to the terrorists he was instructing. Ali Sheikh Mohammed told them to watch the cabin doors at takeoff and landing to observe whether the captain went to the lavatory during the flight and to note whether the flight attendants brought food into the cockpit. I continue to quote: The best time to storm the cockpit would be about 10 to 15 minutes after takeoff when the cockpit doors typically were opened for the first time. Furthermore-- States the 9/11 Commission report-- they had no firm contingency plans-- ``They'' being the terrorists-- in case the cockpit door was locked. They were confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider breaking them down a viable idea. Since then, we have made the doors even more durable. It would be even more difficult to actually break down the door or otherwise open a closed door. The problem is when the door is open. This is not just a theoretical risk. Since 9/11, there have been at least 51 attempts at cockpit breaches worldwide. Five attempts have been successful. One successful attempt occurred in 2006 on Turkish Airlines Flight 1476. Terrorists were successful in entering the cockpit after a flight attendant opened the door to ask the pilots if they needed anything. So it seems to me unacceptable, when we have a readily available solution, to continue to take this risk. It is just common sense to install secondary barriers on commercial planes. These are inexpensive, several thousand dollars to install. They are lightweight and easy to use and very compact when they are not engaged. The only people who would be inconvenienced by these secondary barriers would be terrorists. Had the secondary barriers, these kinds of barriers, been installed on 9/11, it would have made the job very difficult for the terrorists to ever get into the cockpit. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think this is a sensible amendment. The substance of this has been approved in the House. We ought to pass it on the Senate floor and pass this FAA reauthorization underlying bill. If we do that, in time, our skies will be that much safer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa Proper Role of a Supreme Court Justice Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a significant number of Americans believe the Supreme Court is highly politicized. Its approval rating has fallen over the years, not surprisingly. Its approval rating has dropped most drastically in recent years following the President's appointment of Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. There are four Justices who vote in a liberal way in effectively every case the public follows. There are two Justices who stick to the constitutional text and who vote in a consistently conservative way. One Justice votes mostly, but not always, in a conservative way, and one Justice votes sometimes with the conservatives and sometimes with the liberals. All of the liberals were appointed by Democrats, the conservatives and swing Justices were appointed by a Republican President, but in a speech shortly before Justice Scalia's death, Chief Justice Roberts maintained that the public wrongly thinks Justices view themselves as Republicans or as Democrats. Of course, it is irrelevant to the public how the Justices view themselves. What is troubling is that a large segment of the population views the Justices as political. It is appropriate and instructive, then, to ask why the public takes this view and whether that view is warranted. I believe the public's perception is at least sometimes very warranted. The Chief Justice ruled out that this perception has anything to do with what the Justices themselves have done. Instead, he attributes it to the Senate confirmation process. As he sees it, Senators ``frequently ask us questions they know it would be inappropriate for us to answer. Thankfully, we don't answer the questions.'' The Chief Justice also stated: When you have a sharply divided political divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms. You know, if the Democrats and Republicans have been fighting so fiercely about whether you're going to be confirmed, it's natural for some members of the public to think, well, you must be identified in a particular way as a result of that process. On the one hand, the Chief Justice identified precisely why it would be bad for the Court and the nominee to move forward in the middle of a hotly contested Presidential election campaign. As you have heard this Senator say, it would be all politics and no Constitution. Of course, that was the thrust of another Senator a few years back--Chairman Biden's argument in 1992. But in another respect, the Chief Justice has it exactly backwards. The confirmation process doesn't make the Justices appear political. The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the Court itself has drifted from the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. In short, the Justices themselves have gotten political, and because the Justices' decisions are often political and transgress their constitutional role, the process becomes more political. In fact, many of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that the Chief Justice is part of this problem. They believe that a number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones. Certainly, there are academics who agree. [[Page S1662]] In a recent New York Times article, academics appealed to the Chief Justice's political side. These academics asked him to intervene in the current Supreme Court vacancy, suggesting that it could be a so-called John Marshall moment for Chief Justice Roberts. That is a political temptation that the Chief Justice should resist. I can't think of anything any current Justice could do to further damage respect for the Court at this moment than to interject themselves into what Chairman Biden called the political ``cauldron'' of an election year Supreme Court vacancy. In a recent speech, the Chief Justice said: ``We're interpreting the law, not imposing our views.'' He further stated: ``If people don't like the explanation, or don't think it holds together, you know, then they're justified, I think, in viewing us as having transgressed the limits of our role.'' Again, with all due respect to the Chief Justice, tens of millions of Americans believe, correctly, that the Supreme Court has transgressed the limits of its role. Tens of millions of Americans believe, correctly, that too many of the Justices are imposing their views and not interpreting the law. That is the major reason why we should have a debate about the proper role of a Supreme Court Justice. We need to debate whether our current Justices are adhering to their constitutional role. As the Chief Justice remarked, although many of the Supreme Court's decisions are unanimous or nearly so, the Justices tend to disagree on what the Chief Justice called, in his words, the ``hot button issues.'' We all know what kinds of cases he has in mind when he talks about ``hot button issues''--freedom of religion, abortion, affirmative action, gun control, free speech, and the death penalty. One can probably name a lot of others. The Chief Justice was very revealing when he acknowledged that the lesser known cases are often unanimous, and the hot button cases are frequently 5 to 4. But why is that? The law is no more or less likely to be clear in a hot button case than another case. For those Justices committed to the rule of law, it shouldn't be any harder to keep personal preferences out of a politically charged case than any other case. In some cases, the Justices are all willing to follow the law, but in others where they are deeply invested in the policy implications of the ruling, those cases tend to turn out 5 to 4. The explanation of these 5-to-4 rulings must be that in hot button cases some of the Justices are deciding based on their political preferences and not--as they should be--on the law. But if hot button cases are being decided by politicians in robes, then the Supreme Court has no more of a right than the voters to be the final word. The Chief Justice regrets that the American people believe the Court is no different from the political branches of government. But again, and with respect, I think he is concerned with the wrong problem. He would be well-served to address the reality--not the perception--that too often there is little difference between the actions of the Court and the actions of the political branches. So, Physician, heal thyself. In case after 5-to-4 case, the Justices who the Democrats appointed vote for liberal policy results. This can't be a coincidence. Democratic Presidents know what they want when they nominate Justices--Justices who will reach politically liberal results regardless of what the law requires. This, of course, is what our current President means when he says that he wants Justices to look to their ``heart'' to decide the really hard cases. That is an unambiguous invitation for Justices to decide the hot button cases based on personal policy preferences. That, of course, isn't the law, and it is not the appropriate role for the Court. It is no wonder, then, that the public believes the Court is political. What Democratic Presidents want in this regard is what they get--even before Justice Scalia's death. Leading scholars found this Supreme Court to be the most liberal since the 1960s. Justices appointed by Republicans are generally committed to following the law. There are Justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. But some of the Justices appointed even by Republicans often don't vote in a way that advances conservative policy. Contrary to what the Chief Justice suggested, a major reason the confirmation process has become more divisive is that some of the Justices are voting too often based on politics and not on law. If they are going to be political actors after they are confirmed, then the confirmation process necessarily is going to reflect that dynamic. For instance, just last week, after one of my Democratic colleagues met with Judge Garland, the Senator said after discussing issues like reproductive rights: ``I actually feel quite confident that he is deserving of my support.'' Obviously, I don't know what they discussed during that meeting or what Judge Garland said about reproductive rights, and, to be clear, I am not suggesting anything inappropriate was discussed. My point is this: If Justices stuck to the constitutional text and didn't base decisions on their own policy preferences or what the President asked, based on what is in their heart or on empathy for a particular litigant, then Senators wouldn't deem it necessary to understand whether the nominee supports reproductive rights or not. With this in mind, is it any wonder that the public believes the Court is political? If we want the confirmation process to be less divisive, if we want the public to have more confidence that the Justices haven't exceeded their constitutional role, then the Justices themselves need to demonstrate that in politically sensitive cases their decisions are based on the Constitution and the law and not on political preferences or what comes from the heart or because of some empathy. So here is where we are about the public perception of the Court being political. When the Justices return to their appropriate role of deciding cases based on the facts and the law, public perception of the Court will take care of itself. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1655-S1662] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED-- Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes as in morning business. [[Page S1656]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for my 132nd ``Time to Wake Up'' speech. We are now back from recess, and while we were away, one little thing and three really big things happened. The little thing has to do with the so-called war on coal which we have heard so much nonsense about in this Chamber. There was this article, which I am showing on this chart, saying: ``Natural gas has been waging a war on coal for more than a decade, and this is the year it plants the flag.'' Natural gas has been waging a war on coal. Not Obama. Not liberals. Natural gas. The article predicts a resulting ``wave'' of coal plant retirements. Who wrote this? Some green, lefty publication? Actually, it was the Wall Street Journal news department. So as coal companies go bankrupt left and right, there is the coal story. Natural gas has been waging war on coal for more than a decade. Spinning this against the President has been easy politics, but false, and that false political strategy has left coal country with what? Nothing. A carbon fee could produce revenues that could power wealth into coal country, but, no, what they got instead was someone to blame--someone to blame wrongly. Great job. Now to the three big things that happened during our recess. First, a group of very distinguished scientists, led by legendary climate scientist Dr. James Hansen, warned us that this climate change thing is likely to be a lot worse than we thought. Their sweeping synthesis, which underwent an involved and public peer-review process, suggests the possibility of greater sea level rise in this century than forecast. It suggests, worse, even epic storms, and it posits ``losing functionality of all coastal cities.'' How about that for a phrase? They go on to conclude, obviously, that ``the economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable.'' That was one. Second is the Great Barrier Reef, a wonder of the world, hit by the worst coral bleaching ever measured. For those of my colleagues who don't know, uplanders who may not understand what coral bleaching is, it is like cardiac arrest for coral. You are not necessarily dead yet, but there is a very good chance you will be, and for sure you are in serious trouble and you will need time to recover. That is what is happening in the Great Barrier Reef. The third thing is a new study out of UMass and Penn State which found that the expected loss of Antarctic ice ``nearly doubles'' prior estimates of sea level rise. I am from an ocean State. I am from Rhode Island, the Ocean State. This is consequential. How consequential? Here is what one of the authors of the study said: ``You're remapping the way the planet looks from space with those numbers, not just subtle changes about which neighborhoods are going to be susceptible to storm surge,'' but remapping the way the planet looks from space. Of course, CO 2 levels continue to exceed 400 parts per million against a human history where they were always between 170 and 300 until the industrial era drove it up. So that is not great news, but here is what is sickening about it. We don't seem to care here. It has all been in the news. Senators read the news. It is not like we are being deprived of information. We just as an institution do not care. That is a defect. That makes us a defective institution, not to be able to receive and process information like this. This is institutional failure, and we don't even care about that because one might say: You know, I don't really care myself about all of this damage, but as a Member of this body, I get that the U.S. Senate ought to care institutionally. It is like secondary caring. I will do my duty. Even if I personally don't care about oceans or reefs or coasts or storms, I am in. I am in, even though it is not my thing, because I know it is important. But we don't even do that. So we really don't care. Why? Why would we be so blind? We are not all terrible people. Some of us actually spend time outdoors and profess to care about nature. So why does the Senate, as a body collectively, not give a hoot? It is a deadly combination of politics and money. That is what investigation and history will show, and the investigations are underway. The history will not be pretty. We are surrounded by money. Senators exist in a world of money the way fish exist in a world of water. We are so accustomed to it, we barely even notice it. Hundreds of millions of dollars every year in lobbying money surround us. Hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money every election have to be raised. Hundreds of millions in PAC money pours in and exerts its influence, and we don't even know how much dark money there is flowing around through loopholes the size of the Holland Tunnel. Just one--one--dark money group is spending $750 million in the 2016 elections. It is a disgrace, but it has an effect. The interests that spend hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying us want things. The interests who give hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money want things. The PACs and the super PACs pointing $750 million in political artillery at us, they want things. Some want ideological things, but most want money. More exactly, they want things we can do that can be turned into money: licenses, tax breaks, trade advantages, regulations, relief from regulations. You name it, they want it because they can turn it into money. All of that has a desensitizing effect on our values here. If something can't be monetized, we get trained not to care about it. Values that aren't monetized in the marketplace start to seem weird. Who cares about a reef? What is that weird Senator doing talking about a reef? What a silly thing to talk about in our serious world. Now, someone's favorable fat cat tax rate, that is important. Jerking around a perfectly qualified Supreme Court nominee, that is definitely important, but the greatest crisis facing the natural world as we know it, no. And we go along. We go along with that warped value system. It is a lie. It is a moral lie so big it envelopes us, and we acclimate to it. All that money around us slowly anesthetizes our moral and natural senses, and that is how this place becomes Mammon Hall. It is actually even worse than that. It is not just that if you can't cash it in, it doesn't matter around here. It is that big, greedy special interests come here to plunder, and we let them. We let them, and we even help them because we become dependent on their money. Well, I have a proposition. Years ago, one of the Koch brothers, America's biggest polluters, ran for Vice President as a Libertarian Party candidate. When he ran, he learned something. He learned the perverse math of third parties in a two-party system. The perverse math of third parties in a two-party system is that you only hurt the ones you love. You hurt the party you are closest to by your third party taking votes away from the party closest to your politics. Well, the Kochs may be a lot of things, but they aren't stupid, and I think they learned. They learned that a creepy far-right third party that could be put in tow to big polluters was not the right method to achieve their purposes. There was a smarter method. Invade the Republican Party, that Grand Old Party of Theodore Roosevelt, capture it, turn it into the far-right party of their dreams. That was the smart play. Money and secrecy could make it happen, and they are pretty close to having done it. The Republican Party in Congress is as dependent on fossil fuel and polluter money now as a deep sea diver is on his air hose. Cut the airhose or pinch the flow, and we have a diver in real distress. When you control a deep sea diver's airhose, he becomes a pretty obedient diver. It is a form of the Golden Rule: He who wields the gold makes the rules. The political press, by the way, does little to help. It is a game to them. Who will say something appalling we can chatter about on the talk shows? Who is up? Who is down? Who said what about whom? It is akin to a soccer team of 7-year-olds. Most everybody runs to the ball or whatever the shiny object of the moment is, and in the midst of them are outfits that masquerade as the political press, but they are really polluter PR fronts in disguise. They, too, are in tow to the fossil fuel industry. Money and secrecy have their way. [[Page S1657]] So here we are in the Senate, in the face of this news that came to us over the recess, ineffective, defective, idly paying no attention to what is really important as we chase political trifles around, making a mockery of our great American democratic experiment. Well, folks, people are going to notice. This climate mess we have created is only going in one direction. When everybody has noticed, when it is way past denying, elected officials who refused to even look at the problem are going to look pretty foolish, and they are going to have to explain. Well, you see, I thought there was this big hoax. Really. Yes, I thought NASA's scientists and NOAA's scientists were all in on it, along with the U.S. Navy and every National Lab we fund. Hum. That is a big hoax. Oh, did I forget to mention my home State university must have been in on the hoax too? They were all studying climate change effects actually happening in my home State, but I knew better. Great. And every major legitimate American scientific society and most of my home State corporate leaders--I figured they were all wrong. Oh, OK, and where did you get that idea? Oh, from a bunch of guys with financial ties to the polluters. Come on--seriously? Didn't you think that was a pretty obvious conflict of interest? Wow, is that something I should have thought of? But listen. Now I want you to reelect me because I am such a good, prudent, and responsible decisionmaker. Folks, good luck with that. If you think the Republican Party is in trouble now, wait until the day of reckoning comes on climate change. Explain the money. Explain the money. You don't think people are going to figure out how it works? Explain the talk show science you believe instead of the peer-reviewed stuff. Explain the quality of your due diligence into the science. Good luck with that. Explain why you thought NASA, which is driving a rover around on the surface of Mars that they flew there and safely landed--that is probably the greatest scientific and mechanical achievement of our time. They did that, but you say they were part of a hoax on climate change. Really? By the way, I think people here actually owe NASA an apology for saying such nonsense about them, but that is for another day. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming. ObamaCare Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago was the sixth anniversary of President Obama's unpopular health care law. Every year at this time, that birthday is not one people actually want to celebrate. When we take a look at the reasons Americans aren't celebrating ObamaCare's sixth birthday, it is pretty obvious. Let's read them: unsecured data through the Web site, fewer provider choices, over $1 trillion in new taxes on American families, 2 million jobs' worth of hours lost, and skyrocketing premiums and deductibles. It is no surprise that the health care law continues to be very unpopular. Americans know that under the health care law they have less freedom to keep their doctor, to keep the insurance that was right for them and their families, because the President says he gets to decide what somebody needs for themselves and their families--not the families getting to decide for themselves. We know that--again, it came out during the break--people's personal data is not secure at healthcare.gov, as they thought it was. We know insurance companies are continuing to give patients fewer choices by limiting the networks of doctors that people can see. The health care law has added over $1 trillion in new taxes onto hardworking American families. Premiums and deductibles are up, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, ObamaCare is cutting the hours Americans can work by about 2 million jobs over the next decade. So it seems that every day there is more news coming out on how the health care law is unaffordable, unpopular, and unworkable. Last week there was a new study that explains one of the reasons why the President's health care law is collapsing. There was a study that came out from Blue Cross Blue Shield. It compared people buying new health insurance coverage in the ObamaCare exchanges to people who already had health insurance through their jobs. The study found that the new ObamaCare customers went to the doctor 26 percent more often than other people did, that they were admitted to the hospital almost twice as often, that ObamaCare customers have higher costs, and that the average medical spending is about $1,200 a year higher for people on ObamaCare than people who get their insurance through work. So why is it that hospital admissions are up so much for people who are on ObamaCare, and why is it that doctors' visits are up 26 percent? Because the new ObamaCare enrollees are sicker and costlier. So insurance companies of course have to raise their premiums. People are sicker who are signing up. They go to the doctor more. The insurance company turns around, and it raises premiums on everyone else. That is why so many people are opposed to the health care law--because the impact it has had on them personally. When insurance companies have to raise their rates on ObamaCare plans, a lot of money is paid by taxpayers because it is the taxpayers who are paying for the subsidies for all the folks who have signed up for ObamaCare. What we know is that taxpayers are subsidizing the premiums of 83 percent of the people who buy ObamaCare insurance. When the premiums go up, taxes have to be made up to pay for it. Well, when companies can't get enough extra money, they just stop offering policies. Under ObamaCare that may happen. Then more people will lose their insurance coverage. Maybe some companies will just go out of business. We are familiar with that process because we have seen it. We have seen that under the ObamaCare health care law, a majority of the ObamaCare health insurance co-ops have actually gone bankrupt. The health care law created 23 co-ops, and 12 have already gone out of business. Premiums were already out of control, and it is getting worse. The average premium for what is called the benchmark silver plan in the ObamaCare exchange is more than 7 percent higher this year than last year. For people who can only afford the cheaper bronze plan, premiums are up 13 percent compared to last year. Over the next couple of months, insurance companies are going to start setting their rates for 2017. They are going to take into account what has happened in the previous year. So this new study by Blue Cross Blue Shield is just laying the groundwork for even more price increases to come next year. I think this is one of the things that explains why so many people dislike ObamaCare. A new poll came out that found that 47 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the health care law. The Kaiser Family Foundation report shows Americans' opinion of ObamaCare is tilting negative--47 percent marked it unpopular in March of 2016. A year ago this poll said that 42 percent of the people had an unfavorable view. There we were a year ago. Here we are now. The number keeps climbing. Now only 41 percent of the people have a favorable view of the health care law. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Mr. President, 6 years ago Democrats in Washington were very confident that the law would be extremely popular today. As a matter of fact, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York went on ``Meet the Press'' back in 2010 and said: ``It is going to become more popular.'' He said: ``I predict that by November those who voted for the health care law will find it an asset.'' Well, we all remember what happened in the 2010 elections. We know that Democrats who voted for the health care law did not find it an asset. Democrats lost six seats in the Senate that year, and they lost control of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi was out as Speaker of the House, and the Republicans took the majority. Then in 2013, Senator Harry Reid was making this same prediction about how popular the health care law was going to be. He told the newspaper The [[Page S1658]] Hill in Washington that ObamaCare would be ``a net positive'' for Democrats in 2014. Senator Reid forced the health care law through Congress when he was the majority leader, and I think that is a big part of why he is now the minority leader. He lost the majority in the Senate. Why? I think in big part because of the health care law and the fact that it ignored the needs of the American people. The longer people have to live with this offensive and expensive law, the less popular it gets. It was never popular to begin with, but today, even more than before, the opinion is, as this poster says, ``tilting negative.'' The same poll also found something I found amazing. I have practiced medicine for 25 years, and I have been involved here in the Senate for a number of years. I have never seen anything like this. This new poll found that 28 percent of Americans say that this health care law has directly hurt them and their families. The President says: Defend and be proud of this law. How can you defend and be proud of something that 28 percent of the American public tells you has hurt them and their family personally? Only 18 percent in the poll said the law had directly helped them. It is incredible and it is disturbing. ObamaCare is hurting far more people than it is helping. Costs are going up much faster than Democrats promised, as are copays and deductibles. It is no wonder the law is unpopular. We know the health care law makes it more expensive for taxpayers--but how much more expensive? The Congressional Budget Office came out with a report last week. It said that over the next 10 years the health care law is going to cost $136 billion more than they thought it would cost just a year ago. When they compared what they thought it was going to cost a year ago and what they think it is going to cost now, it is $136 billion more. That is despite there being fewer people in the insurance exchanges than they expected. They predicted there would be 21 million people buying ObamaCare health insurance this year. In fact, they say it is going to be no more than 12 million. People are doing everything they can to avoid these insurance policies--especially young, healthy people. So why is it going to cost an extra $136 billion? One of the reasons is higher premiums, sicker patients, and because the law has dumped so many more people into Medicaid. About 23 percent of the people in the country under the age of 65 are now on Medicaid. That is what the Congressional Budget Office says--one out of every four. Is that a success--putting all these additional people on Medicaid? The President says it is. As a doctor who has practiced medicine and taken care of patients for over 25 years, putting additional people on Medicaid is not a success. It is not what people wanted, and it is not what President Obama promised. Americans deserve better. They deserve better than to be shoved into this second-tier health care system. Plus, in terms of government health care programs and wasting money, a recent study found that for every dollar spent on Medicaid, people only get about 20 to 40 cents on every dollar spent. How is that for an inefficient government system? Almost every day we get more information on the damage the health care law is doing to Americans across the country. Republicans have offered solutions that would actually keep the promises the Democrats made for ObamaCare, such as letting people keep their doctors and keep their insurance, giving more people options for how they can reduce their costs of medical care. Americans have now been forced to try this ObamaCare experiment--what the Democrats wanted--and forced to do it for the last 6 years. ObamaCare isn't getting any better. It is just getting older, and it is still making things worse for American families. That is why it is so unpopular. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today marks my 38th edition of ``Waste of the Week.'' With our Nation $19 trillion in debt, I am going to continue coming to the Senate floor every week the Senate is in session to highlight verified and documented examples of waste, fraud, and abuse. I turn to reports from nonpartisan organizations such as the Government Accountability Office which indicate that, thankfully, somebody is looking into how we run this government, coming up with examples of how we can run it better. They let the American people know that we are not wisely and carefully spending their taxpayer dollars, and, hopefully, we can take remedial action. Last year, I detailed an investigation by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, the GAO, which discovered that fraudulent applications are being accepted by healthcare.gov. That is the government's health care Web site for choosing ObamaCare plans on the Federal exchange. Just last month, I discussed a new report from the GAO that outlined how healthcare.gov allowed people to sign up for and receive ObamaCare benefits without proper verification. They did a test. They made up some names, they filled out the application, they sent it in to healthcare.gov, and 11 out of the 12 test applications came back approved, with no verification whatsoever. Subsidies started going out to these people. Even after they were notified at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it took months to correct. Some people collected these subsidies; these fraudulent subsidies went somewhere. These were just made-up names. When we look at 11 out of 12, we have to say something is wrong with the system. And if we extrapolated that out, there could be a stunning number of fraudulent applications certified and subsidies sent to people that don't exist. Today I want to discuss even more ObamaCare problems. This one totals up to $1.16 billion worth of problems. We all know that the Affordable Care Act--which I call the Unaffordable Care Act, based on its operations so far--directed States to either develop their own State-based exchange to operate ObamaCare or to use the Federal exchange accessible at healthcare.gov. States had a choice about the action to take. But in order to try to get States to set up their own exchanges, the Obama Administration awarded billions of dollars in Federal grants to States if they agreed to plan and develop a State exchange. In 6 of the 14 States that chose to develop their own exchanges and receive these Federal grants--Maryland, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Mexico, and Nevada--the end results were disastrous. In fact, the GAO found that these State exchanges were given the green light without the systems ever being fully tested. For example, Maryland's exchange Web site had more than 600 unresolved defects, and Massachusetts had over 1100 unresolved defects. And yet the exchanges were given the go-ahead by the Obama Administration even though these unresolved defects were not realized and not addressed. In Oregon, a State exchange was set up by political operatives. Months after the enrollment period began, the online Oregon exchange couldn't enroll a single person, and applicants had to fax in their handwritten materials. Talk about a dysfunctional rollout. On this Senate floor we have talked about how, in the rush to prove that ObamaCare was what this country needed and that the government could efficiently and effectively run a health care system and in a rush to prove and get the thing up and going according to what the promises were, all kinds of mistakes were made. Oregon's abysmal failure cost taxpayers $305 million plus an additional $41 million that had to be spent to bring Oregon onto the Federal exchange. In other words, they failed to set up their State exchange and cost taxpayers $305 million. Then they had to spend another $41 million to transfer the system over to the Federal exchange. All totaled, the Federal government gave these six States $1.16 billion, and today none of these six States [[Page S1659]] are independently operating their own individual exchanges. This was a long time in the making. The nonpartisan GAO and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services raised concerns about these State exchanges more than a year before they were scheduled to launch. In other words, the warning went out, saying: You are not getting your act together. This was a year before the process started. We went through that whole year and they still didn't have their act together, and it ended up costing taxpayers $1.16 billion. It is no secret that the Obama Administration was in a rush to get this system up and going, and in the process, who knows how much money has been wasted? Who knows the trauma that people have gone through trying to sign up for these exchanges? I think we all remember the classic debacle that occurred in the whole software system and in the whole exchange system. People were calling in, they couldn't get anybody to answer the phone, and they couldn't get their applications fulfilled. All those promises, you know: Your premiums will not go up a penny. Count on that, the President said, period. Done deal. Take it to the bank. If you want your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Take it to the bank. I guarantee you that is what is going to happen. Costs will not go up. We have all seen deductibles shoot up. We have all seen premiums increase. People weren't able to keep the doctor they wanted. On and on it goes, and on and on it continues, and it is at the expense of the American taxpayer. Well, maybe it is not surprising. I am here every week, and I probably could come up here every day and maybe every hour and detail some waste of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. So today we are going to add more money to our growing list of waste, fraud, and abuse, taking us to $158,777,908,417. It just keeps adding up, and our colleagues have not taken the necessary action to try to tie the deal to these problems. Maybe government has become so overwhelmingly bureaucratic and dysfunctional that we are not able to run this country anymore in an efficient and effective manner. The problem is that we are asking people to go to work every day to put in a hard-earned number of hours earning pay and sending money to Washington, DC, only to find that it is wasted over and over and over. It is a relentless plunge into ever more debt because we don't have the money to pay for what we spend. Then we have to issue bonds in order to collect money, in order to pay for that. All of this falls to the taxpayer, and most of it is going to fall to future generations. They are going to have a limit on their ability to have the opportunity to make a viable living for themselves and for their children, and we wonder why the American people have lost faith in Washington's ability to carefully spend their hard-earned dollars. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Tribute to J. Thomas McGrady Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my wife Diana and I wish we could have been with Tom McGrady to mark the retirement of a good friend and a great legal warrior, Pinellas-Pasco Chief Judge J. Thomas McGrady. I am proud of Tom and his commitment to the law. Over the years he has compiled a tremendous record of success. Simply put, he has made a difference. It is probably unusual for a Senator from Wyoming to speak so highly of a retiring judge from Florida. Over the years, I have had a chance to come to know Tom. I feel honored to call him my friend, and, as often has been said, his departure from the bench will leave some large shoes to fill. Looking back, the script for Tom's life would have made a great movie. For starters, he was born on Christmas Eve. He turned out to be his parents' favorite Christmas gift. As he grew up and began to explore the world around him and develop his talents and abilities, his educational pursuits led him to another highlight of his life--high school--where he met and went on to marry his high school sweetheart, Mary Choquette. His interest in the law must have started around then because after graduating from the University of Florida with his bachelor's degree, he then got his juris doctorate degree there, and then joined a law firm and started practicing civil litigation. Before long he opened his own law firm. He practiced law for 25 years. He was so good that Governor Bush appointed him county judge. He was then appointed a circuit judge, again by Governor Bush. Whenever Tom ran for reelection, he won-- without opposition. People admired him and greatly appreciated his efforts on the bench so much that no one ran against him. Perhaps the best indication of his ability as a judge and the affection of those with whom he served was his unanimous election by 68 of his judge colleagues to chief judge 3 times. During Tom's service as chief judge, he discovered that with his election came a number of problems--Tom probably called them challenges--that came packaged together with his new duties. He had to deal with cuts to the court budget. He had to deal with a mortgage foreclosure crisis. He had to deal with a number of other issues. He was also working with a system that relied on old and outdated technologies, to name just a few of the matters that required his attention as chief judge. Probably the biggest problem was the shortage of funds to run the courts. Things were so bad that it looked as if drastic measures would have to be taken to keep the courts up and running. He came up with an option to obtain a loan from the Governor and the legislature. Without it, there would have been severe cuts, furloughs, and much more. He received a great reception when he shared the details of the problem with those who would be most affected--the judges and their staff. They appreciated his blunt assessment of how bad things were, as Tom put it, ``not because of what I had to say, but because I would even come and tell them.'' Tom is a straight shooter, and he knew that the best antidote for the impact of bad news was not to sugar coat it but to tell ``the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'' It also helped that Tom had established a reputation over the years for being a gentle man and a gentleman, and his honesty, sincerity, good humor, and concern for his colleagues and staffers earned him a lot of good will. Now that Tom has decided to retire and sit back, he will have more time to share with his family and friends. I know they will enjoy being with him and having more time to share with him, especially his grandchildren, who will love having ``Papa'' around a little more often. In the end, that is what it is all about--time. Time for faith, family, and friends. Time is the most valuable and precious asset we have, and how we choose to spend it and the quality of those activities that consume most of our time say a lot about the quality of our lives. I once heard about a guy who traveled around the world doing research on what people were thinking as they grew older. There were a lot of interesting thoughts they shared, but one of the most frequent comments was about spending more time with family. No one said: I wish I had spent more time at work. So, as the old film title says so well, Tom has already had a wonderful life, with so much more to come. He has made the most of every moment and every day. Mary, his sweetheart from his high school days, is still by his side, retired from her days as a schoolteacher. Now they will spend time enjoying all that life has to offer. Tom and Mary both truly earned it. Congratulations, Tom McGrady. You have been a great judge, and you made a difference in more lives than you will ever know. We can all learn a lot from you and the way you have lived your life. God bless you and Mary. Remembering Joseph Medicine Crow Mr. President, I rise to share the news with the Senate that Joseph Medicine Crow, a Crow war chief and American hero, has passed away. If you look in today's Washington Post you will [[Page S1660]] see something unusual--somebody from the West passing away and getting a major mention in the paper. Joe Medicine Crow did that, and he earned it in his 102 years. I know it meant a lot to the students of Western and American history to see the attention he has received, as numerous publications have written about him and his life and his countless contributions to the Crow people and to our Nation. If you have a chance to read the tributes to Joe Medicine Crow--and I hope you do--you will fully understand what an amazing individual he was. A historian for his people and an important part of American life, he accomplished more in his life than I could ever describe in these remarks. As I read the articles that were so well researched, they reminded me of meeting and getting to know him when he was on the board of All American Indian Days. That was a gathering that would draw tribal members from all over the United States to Sheridan, WY. They would come to share their history, their culture, their traditions, their sports, their dances, and their arts and crafts. I know that gathering meant a lot to him because one of his top priorities in his life was to ensure that the legacy of the Crow and all tribes would never be forgotten and that their way of life would be passed down from generation to generation. In an effort to bring us all together as one and overcome the racial divides that separate us, a man named F.H. Sinclair--a columnist for the Sheridan Press who was known by his nickname of ``Neckyoke Jones''--came up with the idea of gathering all the tribes together in Sheridan, WY, to demonstrate these talents and abilities. I grew up there, and I was fascinated by the event. As you can imagine, it took a substantial amount of money to organize and plan the event each year, but it paid big dividends for those who were able to attend and all those who heard about it. It was a source of great pride for us all to have this time when we would come together and celebrate the culture of the tribes and the individuals who were so near to us. It provided the kind of exposure and interaction that is so necessary to bring people together and overcome prejudice and bias. I could see the difference the gathering made and the impact it had on those who attended. Events like that and the opportunity they provide help us to get to know people who come from different cultures and backgrounds and help us to understand and appreciate each other. They remove the boundaries that are created by fear and a lack of understanding. They foster and increase the feeling of community that makes our cities and towns better places to live. I remember how Joe served on that board and helped with the Miss Indian American Pageant that was part of All American Indian Days. It was a competition of young women who were chosen by their tribes based on their knowledge of their tribal culture, their history, and their traditional dress. My mother, Dorothy Enzi, worked with Joe Medicine Crow and Suzie Yellowtail on the particulars that needed to be worked out to put on the pageant. My mother would then chaperone the winner to events during the year. Joe Medicine Crow had a great affection for Wyoming and a love of our land that was never surpassed. In addition to the Crow, Joe Medicine Crow was well known to the Wyoming Arapahos and Shoshones. In so many ways, Joe Medicine Crow was an ambassador for his tribe and his way of life. He was an inspiration to us all. Joe Medicine Crow referred to his life as living in two worlds. In one, he worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs for 32 years. Then he returned and fit right back into the other and the culture that surrounded him. It didn't bother him that his life was divided into two worlds. In fact, he said he enjoyed them both. The tributes to him and the way he lived his life have already started coming in from those who knew him, his family, and his friends. He was a military hero, having served in the Army in World War II. He was not only a student of history, he was a historian who helped to preserve the stories and the culture of the Crow. He also had a great respect for all the traditions of his people. I will always find a sense of pride and inspiration in the words he used to describe Wyoming. He said that although sage can be found in so many places in the West, the most sacred sage had to be collected on the tribal lands in Wyoming. Joe Medicine Crow was given 102 years of life, and he made the most of every day. He has a record of which we can be very proud. That is why I hope you will seek out the stories about him that made him such an important part of our history. In 2009 President Barack Obama presented him with the highest honor awarded to a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I know it must have meant a great deal to him to be so recognized--not for himself but for what he knew it would mean to current and future generations. Now he has passed on from this life and left behind more accomplishments and achievements than we could possibly imagine. His life was like that--102 years of making a difference every day, a difference that will always be remembered and never be forgotten. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Congratulating the Villanova Wildcats on Winning the 2016 NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I intend to address an amendment to the FAA authorization bill that Senator Casey and I are offering. But before I do that, I wish to take a quick moment to celebrate an amazing basketball game last night and an amazing victory for an amazing team, the Villanova Wildcats. It just made everyone in Pennsylvania so proud. They have had a fantastic season, a fantastic tournament, and last night I think we witnessed one of the greatest college basketball games ever. I know that is saying an awful lot. There have been a lot of college basketball games, but the game was unbelievable. We had two fantastic teams, extremely well matched, extremely talented, very well coached on both teams, and they just played phenomenally. I don't know how many times the lead changed. I don't think it ever got more than 10 points away from either team. It was just so much fun to watch, all the way through. I think Jay Wright has proven once again what a magnificent coach he is. The kids who played demonstrated just amazing teamwork and talent, and all of the attributes we want to see in college athletics we saw on display last night. I can't say enough about the University of North Carolina. What a great team they are. They played with so much heart and they played so well. I think we are going to watch the end of that game--the final 5 seconds of that game--for a long time to come. I will say when Marcus Paige took that shot, it looked to me like he was 20 feet behind the three-point line. He had almost been knocked over. He was airborne in a very odd and awkward position because he had just dodged another player. He got the shot off, and somehow it dropped. They tied the game, and there were 4.7 seconds left. At that point, I thought: Well, I am in for a late night because this is going to be the first of overtimes since it is tied with only 4.7 seconds left, but that was not the way it ended, as we know. The Wildcats had a plan and they executed it brilliantly with a great play to move the ball up the court quickly, to get it to Kris Jenkins, who put up a long three-point shot, and released it just before the buzzer went off. The buzzer went off while the ball was sailing through the air, sunk the basket, and won the game with no time left. It was the most dramatic and exciting finish to a basketball game that I can recall. I want to take this moment to congratulate the Villanova Wildcats on an outstanding season, tournament, and game last night. Congratulations to our new national champions. Mr. President, now let me turn my attention to the amendment I alluded to; that is, an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill. Senator Casey and I are going to offer as an amendment the legislation we have introduced as a freestanding bill, and that is the Saracini Aviation Safety Act of 2016. I thank Senator Casey for the very good work he has done on this issue for some time. Let me give a little bit of background on the amendment, which is based on [[Page S1661]] the legislation that is named after Victor Saracini. Victor Saracini was a Bucks County, PA, native. He was a Navy pilot. After he left the Navy, he became a commercial airline pilot. He was a captain. He was the captain of United Flight 175 which, as my colleagues will recall, was one of the planes that was captured by terrorists on 9/11. The fact is, Captain Saracini was murdered by the terrorists when they stormed the cockpit, took control of the plane, killed Victor Saracini, and then flew the plane into the World Trade Center. Victor Saracini left behind his wife Ellen, who is with us today in the Senate. She has been a very forceful and effective advocate for greater safety on board our commercial planes. Victor also left behind two daughters, Kirsten and Brielle. The amendment does something very simple. It requires a secondary barrier to the cockpit on commercial aircraft. That is all. That will prevent unauthorized individuals from getting into the cockpit. It is as simple as that. It is a simple, lightweight, inexpensive technology, readily available. It is actually made from a wire mesh, and it provides a barrier between the passenger cabin and the cockpit door. It would only be engaged when the cockpit door is open. So why is this necessary? It is necessary because it is still entirely possible for terrorists to hijack commercial aircraft. Back in 2001, after 9/11, Congress took a step to make commercial aircraft cockpits more secure. They mandated the installation of reinforced doors, and these reinforced doors are much stronger than the doors that used to exist. It is very difficult--almost impossible--to breach those doors when they are closed, but the threat remains because on every long flight and on many short flights the doors are open. At some point during the course of the flight, pilots often get up and they get out of the cockpit. They have to go to the restroom or they go to get some food or a flight attendant goes in to check on the pilots or to bring them something they want. That moment when that door is opened, that door is no longer a barrier. Therein lies the danger. There is the moment of opportunity for terrorists. The FAA fully acknowledges the serious nature of this risk. In April of 2015, an FAA advisory said the following: On long flights, as a matter of necessity, crewmembers must open the flight deck door to access lavatory facilities, to transfer meals to flightcrew members, or to switch crew positions for crew rest purposes. The opening and closing of the flight deck door (referred to as ``door transition''), reduces the protective anti-intrusion/anti-penetration benefits of the reinforced door. . . . During this door transition, the flight deck is vulnerable. Of course, it is not only the FAA that was able to figure this out. The terrorists understand this as well. The 9/11 Commission report said this: Ali Sheikh Mohammed told them-- And the ``them'' in this case refers to the terrorists he was instructing. Ali Sheikh Mohammed told them to watch the cabin doors at takeoff and landing to observe whether the captain went to the lavatory during the flight and to note whether the flight attendants brought food into the cockpit. I continue to quote: The best time to storm the cockpit would be about 10 to 15 minutes after takeoff when the cockpit doors typically were opened for the first time. Furthermore-- States the 9/11 Commission report-- they had no firm contingency plans-- ``They'' being the terrorists-- in case the cockpit door was locked. They were confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider breaking them down a viable idea. Since then, we have made the doors even more durable. It would be even more difficult to actually break down the door or otherwise open a closed door. The problem is when the door is open. This is not just a theoretical risk. Since 9/11, there have been at least 51 attempts at cockpit breaches worldwide. Five attempts have been successful. One successful attempt occurred in 2006 on Turkish Airlines Flight 1476. Terrorists were successful in entering the cockpit after a flight attendant opened the door to ask the pilots if they needed anything. So it seems to me unacceptable, when we have a readily available solution, to continue to take this risk. It is just common sense to install secondary barriers on commercial planes. These are inexpensive, several thousand dollars to install. They are lightweight and easy to use and very compact when they are not engaged. The only people who would be inconvenienced by these secondary barriers would be terrorists. Had the secondary barriers, these kinds of barriers, been installed on 9/11, it would have made the job very difficult for the terrorists to ever get into the cockpit. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think this is a sensible amendment. The substance of this has been approved in the House. We ought to pass it on the Senate floor and pass this FAA reauthorization underlying bill. If we do that, in time, our skies will be that much safer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa Proper Role of a Supreme Court Justice Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a significant number of Americans believe the Supreme Court is highly politicized. Its approval rating has fallen over the years, not surprisingly. Its approval rating has dropped most drastically in recent years following the President's appointment of Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. There are four Justices who vote in a liberal way in effectively every case the public follows. There are two Justices who stick to the constitutional text and who vote in a consistently conservative way. One Justice votes mostly, but not always, in a conservative way, and one Justice votes sometimes with the conservatives and sometimes with the liberals. All of the liberals were appointed by Democrats, the conservatives and swing Justices were appointed by a Republican President, but in a speech shortly before Justice Scalia's death, Chief Justice Roberts maintained that the public wrongly thinks Justices view themselves as Republicans or as Democrats. Of course, it is irrelevant to the public how the Justices view themselves. What is troubling is that a large segment of the population views the Justices as political. It is appropriate and instructive, then, to ask why the public takes this view and whether that view is warranted. I believe the public's perception is at least sometimes very warranted. The Chief Justice ruled out that this perception has anything to do with what the Justices themselves have done. Instead, he attributes it to the Senate confirmation process. As he sees it, Senators ``frequently ask us questions they know it would be inappropriate for us to answer. Thankfully, we don't answer the questions.'' The Chief Justice also stated: When you have a sharply divided political divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms. You know, if the Democrats and Republicans have been fighting so fiercely about whether you're going to be confirmed, it's natural for some members of the public to think, well, you must be identified in a particular way as a result of that process. On the one hand, the Chief Justice identified precisely why it would be bad for the Court and the nominee to move forward in the middle of a hotly contested Presidential election campaign. As you have heard this Senator say, it would be all politics and no Constitution. Of course, that was the thrust of another Senator a few years back--Chairman Biden's argument in 1992. But in another respect, the Chief Justice has it exactly backwards. The confirmation process doesn't make the Justices appear political. The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the Court itself has drifted from the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. In short, the Justices themselves have gotten political, and because the Justices' decisions are often political and transgress their constitutional role, the process becomes more political. In fact, many of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that the Chief Justice is part of this problem. They believe that a number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones. Certainly, there are academics who agree. [[Page S1662]] In a recent New York Times article, academics appealed to the Chief Justice's political side. These academics asked him to intervene in the current Supreme Court vacancy, suggesting that it could be a so-called John Marshall moment for Chief Justice Roberts. That is a political temptation that the Chief Justice should resist. I can't think of anything any current Justice could do to further damage respect for the Court at this moment than to interject themselves into what Chairman Biden called the political ``cauldron'' of an election year Supreme Court vacancy. In a recent speech, the Chief Justice said: ``We're interpreting the law, not imposing our views.'' He further stated: ``If people don't like the explanation, or don't think it holds together, you know, then they're justified, I think, in viewing us as having transgressed the limits of our role.'' Again, with all due respect to the Chief Justice, tens of millions of Americans believe, correctly, that the Supreme Court has transgressed the limits of its role. Tens of millions of Americans believe, correctly, that too many of the Justices are imposing their views and not interpreting the law. That is the major reason why we should have a debate about the proper role of a Supreme Court Justice. We need to debate whether our current Justices are adhering to their constitutional role. As the Chief Justice remarked, although many of the Supreme Court's decisions are unanimous or nearly so, the Justices tend to disagree on what the Chief Justice called, in his words, the ``hot button issues.'' We all know what kinds of cases he has in mind when he talks about ``hot button issues''--freedom of religion, abortion, affirmative action, gun control, free speech, and the death penalty. One can probably name a lot of others. The Chief Justice was very revealing when he acknowledged that the lesser known cases are often unanimous, and the hot button cases are frequently 5 to 4. But why is that? The law is no more or less likely to be clear in a hot button case than another case. For those Justices committed to the rule of law, it shouldn't be any harder to keep personal preferences out of a politically charged case than any other case. In some cases, the Justices are all willing to follow the law, but in others where they are deeply invested in the policy implications of the ruling, those cases tend to turn out 5 to 4. The explanation of these 5-to-4 rulings must be that in hot button cases some of the Justices are deciding based on their political preferences and not--as they should be--on the law. But if hot button cases are being decided by politicians in robes, then the Supreme Court has no more of a right than the voters to be the final word. The Chief Justice regrets that the American people believe the Court is no different from the political branches of government. But again, and with respect, I think he is concerned with the wrong problem. He would be well-served to address the reality--not the perception--that too often there is little difference between the actions of the Court and the actions of the political branches. So, Physician, heal thyself. In case after 5-to-4 case, the Justices who the Democrats appointed vote for liberal policy results. This can't be a coincidence. Democratic Presidents know what they want when they nominate Justices--Justices who will reach politically liberal results regardless of what the law requires. This, of course, is what our current President means when he says that he wants Justices to look to their ``heart'' to decide the really hard cases. That is an unambiguous invitation for Justices to decide the hot button cases based on personal policy preferences. That, of course, isn't the law, and it is not the appropriate role for the Court. It is no wonder, then, that the public believes the Court is political. What Democratic Presidents want in this regard is what they get--even before Justice Scalia's death. Leading scholars found this Supreme Court to be the most liberal since the 1960s. Justices appointed by Republicans are generally committed to following the law. There are Justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. But some of the Justices appointed even by Republicans often don't vote in a way that advances conservative policy. Contrary to what the Chief Justice suggested, a major reason the confirmation process has become more divisive is that some of the Justices are voting too often based on politics and not on law. If they are going to be political actors after they are confirmed, then the confirmation process necessarily is going to reflect that dynamic. For instance, just last week, after one of my Democratic colleagues met with Judge Garland, the Senator said after discussing issues like reproductive rights: ``I actually feel quite confident that he is deserving of my support.'' Obviously, I don't know what they discussed during that meeting or what Judge Garland said about reproductive rights, and, to be clear, I am not suggesting anything inappropriate was discussed. My point is this: If Justices stuck to the constitutional text and didn't base decisions on their own policy preferences or what the President asked, based on what is in their heart or on empathy for a particular litigant, then Senators wouldn't deem it necessary to understand whether the nominee supports reproductive rights or not. With this in mind, is it any wonder that the public believes the Court is political? If we want the confirmation process to be less divisive, if we want the public to have more confidence that the Justices haven't exceeded their constitutional role, then the Justices themselves need to demonstrate that in politically sensitive cases their decisions are based on the Constitution and the law and not on political preferences or what comes from the heart or because of some empathy. So here is where we are about the public perception of the Court being political. When the Justices return to their appropriate role of deciding cases based on the facts and the law, public perception of the Court will take care of itself. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

[[page s1656]] the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. climate change mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i am here for my 132nd ``time to wake up'' speech. we are now back from recess, and while we were away, one little thing and three really big things happened. the little thing has to do with the so-called war on coal which we have heard so much nonsense about in this chamber. there was this article, which i am showing on this chart, saying: ``natural gas has been waging a war on coal for more than a decade, and this is the year it plants the flag.'' natural gas has been waging a war on coal. not obama. not liberals. natural gas. the article predicts a resulting ``wave'' of coal plant retirements. who wrote this? some green, lefty publication? actually, it was the wall street journal news department. so as coal companies go bankrupt left and right, there is the coal story. natural gas has been waging war on coal for more than a decade. spinning this against the president has been easy politics, but false, and that false political strategy has left coal country with what? nothing. a carbon fee could produce revenues that could power wealth into coal country, but, no, what they got instead was someone to blame--someone to blame wrongly. great job. now to the three big things that happened during our recess. first, a group of very distinguished scientists, led by legendary climate scientist dr. james hansen, warned us that this climate change thing is likely to be a lot worse than we thought. their sweeping synthesis, which underwent an involved and public peer-review process, suggests the possibility of greater sea level rise in this century than forecast. it suggests, worse, even epic storms, and it posits ``losing functionality of all coastal cities.'' how about that for a phrase? they go on to conclude, obviously, that ``the economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable.'' that was one. second is the great barrier reef, a wonder of the world, hit by the worst coral bleaching ever measured. for those of my colleagues who don't know, uplanders who may not understand what coral bleaching is, it is like cardiac arrest for coral. you are not necessarily dead yet, but there is a very good chance you will be, and for sure you are in serious trouble and you will need time to recover. that is what is happening in the great barrier reef. the third thing is a new study out of umass and penn state which found that the expected loss of antarctic ice ``nearly doubles'' prior estimates of sea level rise. i am from an ocean state. i am from rhode island, the ocean state. this is consequential. how consequential? here is what one of the authors of the study said: ``you're remapping the way the planet looks from space with those numbers, not just subtle changes about which neighborhoods are going to be susceptible to storm surge,'' but remapping the way the planet looks from space. of course, co 2 levels continue to exceed 400 parts per million against a human history where they were always between 170 and 300 until the industrial era drove it up. so that is not great news, but here is what is sickening about it. we don't seem to care here. it has all been in the news. senators read the news. it is not like we are being deprived of information. we just as an institution do not care. that is a defect. that makes us a defective institution, not to be able to receive and process information like this. this is institutional failure, and we don't even care about that because one might say: you know, i don't really care myself about all of this damage, but as a member of this body, i get that the u.s. senate ought to care institutionally. it is like secondary caring. i will do my duty. even if i personally don't care about oceans or reefs or coasts or storms, i am in. i am in, even though it is not my thing, because i know it is important. but we don't even do that. so we really don't care. why? why would we be so blind? we are not all terrible people. some of us actually spend time outdoors and profess to care about nature. so why does the senate, as a body collectively, not give a hoot? it is a deadly combination of politics and money. that is what investigation and history will show, and the investigations are underway. the history will not be pretty. we are surrounded by money. senators exist in a world of money the way fish exist in a world of water. we are so accustomed to it, we barely even notice it. hundreds of millions of dollars every year in lobbying money surround us. hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money every election have to be raised. hundreds of millions in pac money pours in and exerts its influence, and we don't even know how much dark money there is flowing around through loopholes the size of the holland tunnel. just one--one--dark money group is spending $750 million in the 2016 elections. it is a disgrace, but it has an effect. the interests that spend hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying us want things. the interests who give hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money want things. the pacs and the super pacs pointing $750 million in political artillery at us, they want things. some want ideological things, but most want money. more exactly, they want things we can do that can be turned into money: licenses, tax breaks, trade advantages, regulations, relief from regulations. you name it, they want it because they can turn it into money. all of that has a desensitizing effect on our values here. if something can't be monetized, we get trained not to care about it. values that aren't monetized in the marketplace start to seem weird. who cares about a reef? what is that weird senator doing talking about a reef? what a silly thing to talk about in our serious world. now, someone's favorable fat cat tax rate, that is important. jerking around a perfectly qualified supreme court nominee, that is definitely important, but the greatest crisis facing the natural world as we know it, no. and we go along. we go along with that warped value system. it is a lie. it is a moral lie so big it envelopes us, and we acclimate to it. all that money around us slowly anesthetizes our moral and natural senses, and that is how this place becomes mammon hall. it is actually even worse than that. it is not just that if you can't cash it in, it doesn't matter around here. it is that big, greedy special interests come here to plunder, and we let them. we let them, and we even help them because we become dependent on their money. well, i have a proposition. years ago, one of the koch brothers, america's biggest polluters, ran for vice president as a libertarian party candidate. when he ran, he learned something. he learned the perverse math of third parties in a two-party system. the perverse math of third parties in a two-party system is that you only hurt the ones you love. you hurt the party you are closest to by your third party taking votes away from the party closest to your politics. well, the kochs may be a lot of things, but they aren't stupid, and i think they learned. they learned that a creepy far-right third party that could be put in tow to big polluters was not the right method to achieve their purposes. there was a smarter method. invade the republican party, that grand old party of theodore roosevelt, capture it, turn it into the far-right party of their dreams. that was the smart play. money and secrecy could make it happen, and they are pretty close to having done it. the republican party in congress is as dependent on fossil fuel and polluter money now as a deep sea diver is on his air hose. cut the airhose or pinch the flow, and we have a diver in real distress. when you control a deep sea diver's airhose, he becomes a pretty obedient diver. it is a form of the golden rule: he who wields the gold makes the rules. the political press, by the way, does little to help. it is a game to them. who will say something appalling we can chatter about on the talk shows? who is up? who is down? who said what about whom? it is akin to a soccer team of 7-year-olds. most everybody runs to the ball or whatever the shiny object of the moment is, and in the midst of them are outfits that masquerade as the political press, but they are really polluter pr fronts in disguise. they, too, are in tow to the fossil fuel industry. money and secrecy have their way. [[page s1657]] so here we are in the senate, in the face of this news that came to us over the recess, ineffective, defective, idly paying no attention to what is really important as we chase political trifles around, making a mockery of our great american democratic experiment. well, folks, people are going to notice. this climate mess we have created is only going in one direction. when everybody has noticed, when it is way past denying, elected officials who refused to even look at the problem are going to look pretty foolish, and they are going to have to explain. well, you see, i thought there was this big hoax. really. yes, i thought nasa's scientists and noaa's scientists were all in on it, along with the u.s. navy and every national lab we fund. hum. that is a big hoax. oh, did i forget to mention my home state university must have been in on the hoax too? they were all studying climate change effects actually happening in my home state, but i knew better. great. and every major legitimate american scientific society and most of my home state corporate leaders--i figured they were all wrong. oh, ok, and where did you get that idea? oh, from a bunch of guys with financial ties to the polluters. come on--seriously? didn't you think that was a pretty obvious conflict of interest? wow, is that something i should have thought of? but listen. now i want you to reelect me because i am such a good, prudent, and responsible decisionmaker. folks, good luck with that. if you think the republican party is in trouble now, wait until the day of reckoning comes on climate change. explain the money. explain the money. you don't think people are going to figure out how it works? explain the talk show science you believe instead of the peer-reviewed stuff. explain the quality of your due diligence into the science. good luck with that. explain why you thought nasa, which is driving a rover around on the surface of mars that they flew there and safely landed--that is probably the greatest scientific and mechanical achievement of our time. they did that, but you say they were part of a hoax on climate change. really? by the way, i think people here actually owe nasa an apology for saying such nonsense about them, but that is for another day. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from wyoming. obamacare mr. barrasso. mr. president, a couple of weeks ago was the sixth anniversary of president obama's unpopular health care law. every year at this time, that birthday is not one people actually want to celebrate. when we take a look at the reasons americans aren't celebrating obamacare's sixth birthday, it is pretty obvious. let's read them: unsecured data through the web site, fewer provider choices, over $1 trillion in new taxes on american families, 2 million jobs' worth of hours lost, and skyrocketing premiums and deductibles. it is no surprise that the health care law continues to be very unpopular. americans know that under the health care law they have less freedom to keep their doctor, to keep the insurance that was right for them and their families, because the president says he gets to decide what somebody needs for themselves and their families--not the families getting to decide for themselves. we know that--again, it came out during the break--people's personal data is not secure at healthcare.gov, as they thought it was. we know insurance companies are continuing to give patients fewer choices by limiting the networks of doctors that people can see. the health care law has added over $1 trillion in new taxes onto hardworking american families. premiums and deductibles are up, and according to the congressional budget office, obamacare is cutting the hours americans can work by about 2 million jobs over the next decade. so it seems that every day there is more news coming out on how the health care law is unaffordable, unpopular, and unworkable. last week there was a new study that explains one of the reasons why the president's health care law is collapsing. there was a study that came out from blue cross blue shield. it compared people buying new health insurance coverage in the obamacare exchanges to people who already had health insurance through their jobs. the study found that the new obamacare customers went to the doctor 26 percent more often than other people did, that they were admitted to the hospital almost twice as often, that obamacare customers have higher costs, and that the average medical spending is about $1,200 a year higher for people on obamacare than people who get their insurance through work. so why is it that hospital admissions are up so much for people who are on obamacare, and why is it that doctors' visits are up 26 percent? because the new obamacare enrollees are sicker and costlier. so insurance companies of course have to raise their premiums. people are sicker who are signing up. they go to the doctor more. the insurance company turns around, and it raises premiums on everyone else. that is why so many people are opposed to the health care law--because the impact it has had on them personally. when insurance companies have to raise their rates on obamacare plans, a lot of money is paid by taxpayers because it is the taxpayers who are paying for the subsidies for all the folks who have signed up for obamacare. what we know is that taxpayers are subsidizing the premiums of 83 percent of the people who buy obamacare insurance. when the premiums go up, taxes have to be made up to pay for it. well, when companies can't get enough extra money, they just stop offering policies. under obamacare that may happen. then more people will lose their insurance coverage. maybe some companies will just go out of business. we are familiar with that process because we have seen it. we have seen that under the obamacare health care law, a majority of the obamacare health insurance co-ops have actually gone bankrupt. the health care law created 23 co-ops, and 12 have already gone out of business. premiums were already out of control, and it is getting worse. the average premium for what is called the benchmark silver plan in the obamacare exchange is more than 7 percent higher this year than last year. for people who can only afford the cheaper bronze plan, premiums are up 13 percent compared to last year. over the next couple of months, insurance companies are going to start setting their rates for 2017. they are going to take into account what has happened in the previous year. so this new study by blue cross blue shield is just laying the groundwork for even more price increases to come next year. i think this is one of the things that explains why so many people dislike obamacare. a new poll came out that found that 47 percent of americans have an unfavorable view of the health care law. the kaiser family foundation report shows americans' opinion of obamacare is tilting negative--47 percent marked it unpopular in march of 2016. a year ago this poll said that 42 percent of the people had an unfavorable view. there we were a year ago. here we are now. the number keeps climbing. now only 41 percent of the people have a favorable view of the health care law. it wasn't supposed to be this way. mr. president, 6 years ago democrats in washington were very confident that the law would be extremely popular today. as a matter of fact, senator chuck schumer of new york went on ``meet the press'' back in 2010 and said: ``it is going to become more popular.'' he said: ``i predict that by november those who voted for the health care law will find it an asset.'' well, we all remember what happened in the 2010 elections. we know that democrats who voted for the health care law did not find it an asset. democrats lost six seats in the senate that year, and they lost control of the house of representatives. nancy pelosi was out as speaker of the house, and the republicans took the majority. then in 2013, senator harry reid was making this same prediction about how popular the health care law was going to be. he told the newspaper the [[page s1658]] hill in washington that obamacare would be ``a net positive'' for democrats in 2014. senator reid forced the health care law through congress when he was the majority leader, and i think that is a big part of why he is now the minority leader. he lost the majority in the senate. why? i think in big part because of the health care law and the fact that it ignored the needs of the american people. the longer people have to live with this offensive and expensive law, the less popular it gets. it was never popular to begin with, but today, even more than before, the opinion is, as this poster says, ``tilting negative.'' the same poll also found something i found amazing. i have practiced medicine for 25 years, and i have been involved here in the senate for a number of years. i have never seen anything like this. this new poll found that 28 percent of americans say that this health care law has directly hurt them and their families. the president says: defend and be proud of this law. how can you defend and be proud of something that 28 percent of the american public tells you has hurt them and their family personally? only 18 percent in the poll said the law had directly helped them. it is incredible and it is disturbing. obamacare is hurting far more people than it is helping. costs are going up much faster than democrats promised, as are copays and deductibles. it is no wonder the law is unpopular. we know the health care law makes it more expensive for taxpayers--but how much more expensive? the congressional budget office came out with a report last week. it said that over the next 10 years the health care law is going to cost $136 billion more than they thought it would cost just a year ago. when they compared what they thought it was going to cost a year ago and what they think it is going to cost now, it is $136 billion more. that is despite there being fewer people in the insurance exchanges than they expected. they predicted there would be 21 million people buying obamacare health insurance this year. in fact, they say it is going to be no more than 12 million. people are doing everything they can to avoid these insurance policies--especially young, healthy people. so why is it going to cost an extra $136 billion? one of the reasons is higher premiums, sicker patients, and because the law has dumped so many more people into medicaid. about 23 percent of the people in the country under the age of 65 are now on medicaid. that is what the congressional budget office says--one out of every four. is that a success--putting all these additional people on medicaid? the president says it is. as a doctor who has practiced medicine and taken care of patients for over 25 years, putting additional people on medicaid is not a success. it is not what people wanted, and it is not what president obama promised. americans deserve better. they deserve better than to be shoved into this second-tier health care system. plus, in terms of government health care programs and wasting money, a recent study found that for every dollar spent on medicaid, people only get about 20 to 40 cents on every dollar spent. how is that for an inefficient government system? almost every day we get more information on the damage the health care law is doing to americans across the country. republicans have offered solutions that would actually keep the promises the democrats made for obamacare, such as letting people keep their doctors and keep their insurance, giving more people options for how they can reduce their costs of medical care. americans have now been forced to try this obamacare experiment--what the democrats wanted--and forced to do it for the last 6 years. obamacare isn't getting any better. it is just getting older, and it is still making things worse for american families. that is why it is so unpopular. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. coats. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. wasteful spending mr. coats. mr. president, today marks my 38th edition of ``waste of the week.'' with our nation $19 trillion in debt, i am going to continue coming to the senate floor every week the senate is in session to highlight verified and documented examples of waste, fraud, and abuse. i turn to reports from nonpartisan organizations such as the government accountability office which indicate that, thankfully, somebody is looking into how we run this government, coming up with examples of how we can run it better. they let the american people know that we are not wisely and carefully spending their taxpayer dollars, and, hopefully, we can take remedial action. last year, i detailed an investigation by the nonpartisan government accountability office, the gao, which discovered that fraudulent applications are being accepted by healthcare.gov. that is the government's health care web site for choosing obamacare plans on the federal exchange. just last month, i discussed a new report from the gao that outlined how healthcare.gov allowed people to sign up for and receive obamacare benefits without proper verification. they did a test. they made up some names, they filled out the application, they sent it in to healthcare.gov, and 11 out of the 12 test applications came back approved, with no verification whatsoever. subsidies started going out to these people. even after they were notified at the centers for medicare and medicaid services, it took months to correct. some people collected these subsidies; these fraudulent subsidies went somewhere. these were just made-up names. when we look at 11 out of 12, we have to say something is wrong with the system. and if we extrapolated that out, there could be a stunning number of fraudulent applications certified and subsidies sent to people that don't exist. today i want to discuss even more obamacare problems. this one totals up to $1.16 billion worth of problems. we all know that the affordable care act--which i call the unaffordable care act, based on its operations so far--directed states to either develop their own state-based exchange to operate obamacare or to use the federal exchange accessible at healthcare.gov. states had a choice about the action to take. but in order to try to get states to set up their own exchanges, the obama administration awarded billions of dollars in federal grants to states if they agreed to plan and develop a state exchange. in 6 of the 14 states that chose to develop their own exchanges and receive these federal grants--maryland, hawaii, massachusetts, oregon, new mexico, and nevada--the end results were disastrous. in fact, the gao found that these state exchanges were given the green light without the systems ever being fully tested. for example, maryland's exchange web site had more than 600 unresolved defects, and massachusetts had over 1100 unresolved defects. and yet the exchanges were given the go-ahead by the obama administration even though these unresolved defects were not realized and not addressed. in oregon, a state exchange was set up by political operatives. months after the enrollment period began, the online oregon exchange couldn't enroll a single person, and applicants had to fax in their handwritten materials. talk about a dysfunctional rollout. on this senate floor we have talked about how, in the rush to prove that obamacare was what this country needed and that the government could efficiently and effectively run a health care system and in a rush to prove and get the thing up and going according to what the promises were, all kinds of mistakes were made. oregon's abysmal failure cost taxpayers $305 million plus an additional $41 million that had to be spent to bring oregon onto the federal exchange. in other words, they failed to set up their state exchange and cost taxpayers $305 million. then they had to spend another $41 million to transfer the system over to the federal exchange. all totaled, the federal government gave these six states $1.16 billion, and today none of these six states [[page s1659]] are independently operating their own individual exchanges. this was a long time in the making. the nonpartisan gao and the centers for medicare and medicaid services raised concerns about these state exchanges more than a year before they were scheduled to launch. in other words, the warning went out, saying: you are not getting your act together. this was a year before the process started. we went through that whole year and they still didn't have their act together, and it ended up costing taxpayers $1.16 billion. it is no secret that the obama administration was in a rush to get this system up and going, and in the process, who knows how much money has been wasted? who knows the trauma that people have gone through trying to sign up for these exchanges? i think we all remember the classic debacle that occurred in the whole software system and in the whole exchange system. people were calling in, they couldn't get anybody to answer the phone, and they couldn't get their applications fulfilled. all those promises, you know: your premiums will not go up a penny. count on that, the president said, period. done deal. take it to the bank. if you want your doctor, you can keep your doctor. take it to the bank. i guarantee you that is what is going to happen. costs will not go up. we have all seen deductibles shoot up. we have all seen premiums increase. people weren't able to keep the doctor they wanted. on and on it goes, and on and on it continues, and it is at the expense of the american taxpayer. well, maybe it is not surprising. i am here every week, and i probably could come up here every day and maybe every hour and detail some waste of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. so today we are going to add more money to our growing list of waste, fraud, and abuse, taking us to $158,777,908,417. it just keeps adding up, and our colleagues have not taken the necessary action to try to tie the deal to these problems. maybe government has become so overwhelmingly bureaucratic and dysfunctional that we are not able to run this country anymore in an efficient and effective manner. the problem is that we are asking people to go to work every day to put in a hard-earned number of hours earning pay and sending money to washington, dc, only to find that it is wasted over and over and over. it is a relentless plunge into ever more debt because we don't have the money to pay for what we spend. then we have to issue bonds in order to collect money, in order to pay for that. all of this falls to the taxpayer, and most of it is going to fall to future generations. they are going to have a limit on their ability to have the opportunity to make a viable living for themselves and for their children, and we wonder why the american people have lost faith in washington's ability to carefully spend their hard-earned dollars. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. enzi. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. tribute to j. thomas mcgrady mr. enzi. mr. president, my wife diana and i wish we could have been with tom mcgrady to mark the retirement of a good friend and a great legal warrior, pinellas-pasco chief judge j. thomas mcgrady. i am proud of tom and his commitment to the law. over the years he has compiled a tremendous record of success. simply put, he has made a difference. it is probably unusual for a senator from wyoming to speak so highly of a retiring judge from florida. over the years, i have had a chance to come to know tom. i feel honored to call him my friend, and, as often has been said, his departure from the bench will leave some large shoes to fill. looking back, the script for tom's life would have made a great movie. for starters, he was born on christmas eve. he turned out to be his parents' favorite christmas gift. as he grew up and began to explore the world around him and develop his talents and abilities, his educational pursuits led him to another highlight of his life--high school--where he met and went on to marry his high school sweetheart, mary choquette. his interest in the law must have started around then because after graduating from the university of florida with his bachelor's degree, he then got his juris doctorate degree there, and then joined a law firm and started practicing civil litigation. before long he opened his own law firm. he practiced law for 25 years. he was so good that governor bush appointed him county judge. he was then appointed a circuit judge, again by governor bush. whenever tom ran for reelection, he won-- without opposition. people admired him and greatly appreciated his efforts on the bench so much that no one ran against him. perhaps the best indication of his ability as a judge and the affection of those with whom he served was his unanimous election by 68 of his judge colleagues to chief judge 3 times. during tom's service as chief judge, he discovered that with his election came a number of problems--tom probably called them challenges--that came packaged together with his new duties. he had to deal with cuts to the court budget. he had to deal with a mortgage foreclosure crisis. he had to deal with a number of other issues. he was also working with a system that relied on old and outdated technologies, to name just a few of the matters that required his attention as chief judge. probably the biggest problem was the shortage of funds to run the courts. things were so bad that it looked as if drastic measures would have to be taken to keep the courts up and running. he came up with an option to obtain a loan from the governor and the legislature. without it, there would have been severe cuts, furloughs, and much more. he received a great reception when he shared the details of the problem with those who would be most affected--the judges and their staff. they appreciated his blunt assessment of how bad things were, as tom put it, ``not because of what i had to say, but because i would even come and tell them.'' tom is a straight shooter, and he knew that the best antidote for the impact of bad news was not to sugar coat it but to tell ``the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'' it also helped that tom had established a reputation over the years for being a gentle man and a gentleman, and his honesty, sincerity, good humor, and concern for his colleagues and staffers earned him a lot of good will. now that tom has decided to retire and sit back, he will have more time to share with his family and friends. i know they will enjoy being with him and having more time to share with him, especially his grandchildren, who will love having ``papa'' around a little more often. in the end, that is what it is all about--time. time for faith, family, and friends. time is the most valuable and precious asset we have, and how we choose to spend it and the quality of those activities that consume most of our time say a lot about the quality of our lives. i once heard about a guy who traveled around the world doing research on what people were thinking as they grew older. there were a lot of interesting thoughts they shared, but one of the most frequent comments was about spending more time with family. no one said: i wish i had spent more time at work. so, as the old film title says so well, tom has already had a wonderful life, with so much more to come. he has made the most of every moment and every day. mary, his sweetheart from his high school days, is still by his side, retired from her days as a schoolteacher. now they will spend time enjoying all that life has to offer. tom and mary both truly earned it. congratulations, tom mcgrady. you have been a great judge, and you made a difference in more lives than you will ever know. we can all learn a lot from you and the way you have lived your life. god bless you and mary. remembering joseph medicine crow mr. president, i rise to share the news with the senate that joseph medicine crow, a crow war chief and american hero, has passed away. if you look in today's washington post you will [[page s1660]] see something unusual--somebody from the west passing away and getting a major mention in the paper. joe medicine crow did that, and he earned it in his 102 years. i know it meant a lot to the students of western and american history to see the attention he has received, as numerous publications have written about him and his life and his countless contributions to the crow people and to our nation. if you have a chance to read the tributes to joe medicine crow--and i hope you do--you will fully understand what an amazing individual he was. a historian for his people and an important part of american life, he accomplished more in his life than i could ever describe in these remarks. as i read the articles that were so well researched, they reminded me of meeting and getting to know him when he was on the board of all american indian days. that was a gathering that would draw tribal members from all over the united states to sheridan, wy. they would come to share their history, their culture, their traditions, their sports, their dances, and their arts and crafts. i know that gathering meant a lot to him because one of his top priorities in his life was to ensure that the legacy of the crow and all tribes would never be forgotten and that their way of life would be passed down from generation to generation. in an effort to bring us all together as one and overcome the racial divides that separate us, a man named f.h. sinclair--a columnist for the sheridan press who was known by his nickname of ``neckyoke jones''--came up with the idea of gathering all the tribes together in sheridan, wy, to demonstrate these talents and abilities. i grew up there, and i was fascinated by the event. as you can imagine, it took a substantial amount of money to organize and plan the event each year, but it paid big dividends for those who were able to attend and all those who heard about it. it was a source of great pride for us all to have this time when we would come together and celebrate the culture of the tribes and the individuals who were so near to us. it provided the kind of exposure and interaction that is so necessary to bring people together and overcome prejudice and bias. i could see the difference the gathering made and the impact it had on those who attended. events like that and the opportunity they provide help us to get to know people who come from different cultures and backgrounds and help us to understand and appreciate each other. they remove the boundaries that are created by fear and a lack of understanding. they foster and increase the feeling of community that makes our cities and towns better places to live. i remember how joe served on that board and helped with the miss indian american pageant that was part of all american indian days. it was a competition of young women who were chosen by their tribes based on their knowledge of their tribal culture, their history, and their traditional dress. my mother, dorothy enzi, worked with joe medicine crow and suzie yellowtail on the particulars that needed to be worked out to put on the pageant. my mother would then chaperone the winner to events during the year. joe medicine crow had a great affection for wyoming and a love of our land that was never surpassed. in addition to the crow, joe medicine crow was well known to the wyoming arapahos and shoshones. in so many ways, joe medicine crow was an ambassador for his tribe and his way of life. he was an inspiration to us all. joe medicine crow referred to his life as living in two worlds. in one, he worked with the bureau of indian affairs for 32 years. then he returned and fit right back into the other and the culture that surrounded him. it didn't bother him that his life was divided into two worlds. in fact, he said he enjoyed them both. the tributes to him and the way he lived his life have already started coming in from those who knew him, his family, and his friends. he was a military hero, having served in the army in world war ii. he was not only a student of history, he was a historian who helped to preserve the stories and the culture of the crow. he also had a great respect for all the traditions of his people. i will always find a sense of pride and inspiration in the words he used to describe wyoming. he said that although sage can be found in so many places in the west, the most sacred sage had to be collected on the tribal lands in wyoming. joe medicine crow was given 102 years of life, and he made the most of every day. he has a record of which we can be very proud. that is why i hope you will seek out the stories about him that made him such an important part of our history. in 2009 president barack obama presented him with the highest honor awarded to a civilian, the presidential medal of freedom. i know it must have meant a great deal to him to be so recognized--not for himself but for what he knew it would mean to current and future generations. now he has passed on from this life and left behind more accomplishments and achievements than we could possibly imagine. his life was like that--102 years of making a difference every day, a difference that will always be remembered and never be forgotten. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from pennsylvania. congratulating the villanova wildcats on winning the 2016 ncaa men's college basketball championship mr. toomey. mr. president, i intend to address an amendment to the faa authorization bill that senator casey and i are offering. but before i do that, i wish to take a quick moment to celebrate an amazing basketball game last night and an amazing victory for an amazing team, the villanova wildcats. it just made everyone in pennsylvania so proud. they have had a fantastic season, a fantastic tournament, and last night i think we witnessed one of the greatest college basketball games ever. i know that is saying an awful lot. there have been a lot of college basketball games, but the game was unbelievable. we had two fantastic teams, extremely well matched, extremely talented, very well coached on both teams, and they just played phenomenally. i don't know how many times the lead changed. i don't think it ever got more than 10 points away from either team. it was just so much fun to watch, all the way through. i think jay wright has proven once again what a magnificent coach he is. the kids who played demonstrated just amazing teamwork and talent, and all of the attributes we want to see in college athletics we saw on display last night. i can't say enough about the university of north carolina. what a great team they are. they played with so much heart and they played so well. i think we are going to watch the end of that game--the final 5 seconds of that game--for a long time to come. i will say when marcus paige took that shot, it looked to me like he was 20 feet behind the three-point line. he had almost been knocked over. he was airborne in a very odd and awkward position because he had just dodged another player. he got the shot off, and somehow it dropped. they tied the game, and there were 4.7 seconds left. at that point, i thought: well, i am in for a late night because this is going to be the first of overtimes since it is tied with only 4.7 seconds left, but that was not the way it ended, as we know. the wildcats had a plan and they executed it brilliantly with a great play to move the ball up the court quickly, to get it to kris jenkins, who put up a long three-point shot, and released it just before the buzzer went off. the buzzer went off while the ball was sailing through the air, sunk the basket, and won the game with no time left. it was the most dramatic and exciting finish to a basketball game that i can recall. i want to take this moment to congratulate the villanova wildcats on an outstanding season, tournament, and game last night. congratulations to our new national champions. mr. president, now let me turn my attention to the amendment i alluded to; that is, an amendment to the faa reauthorization bill. senator casey and i are going to offer as an amendment the legislation we have introduced as a freestanding bill, and that is the saracini aviation safety act of 2016. i thank senator casey for the very good work he has done on this issue for some time. let me give a little bit of background on the amendment, which is based on [[page s1661]] the legislation that is named after victor saracini. victor saracini was a bucks county, pa, native. he was a navy pilot. after he left the navy, he became a commercial airline pilot. he was a captain. he was the captain of united flight 175 which, as my colleagues will recall, was one of the planes that was captured by terrorists on 9/11. the fact is, captain saracini was murdered by the terrorists when they stormed the cockpit, took control of the plane, killed victor saracini, and then flew the plane into the world trade center. victor saracini left behind his wife ellen, who is with us today in the senate. she has been a very forceful and effective advocate for greater safety on board our commercial planes. victor also left behind two daughters, kirsten and brielle. the amendment does something very simple. it requires a secondary barrier to the cockpit on commercial aircraft. that is all. that will prevent unauthorized individuals from getting into the cockpit. it is as simple as that. it is a simple, lightweight, inexpensive technology, readily available. it is actually made from a wire mesh, and it provides a barrier between the passenger cabin and the cockpit door. it would only be engaged when the cockpit door is open. so why is this necessary? it is necessary because it is still entirely possible for terrorists to hijack commercial aircraft. back in 2001, after 9/11, congress took a step to make commercial aircraft cockpits more secure. they mandated the installation of reinforced doors, and these reinforced doors are much stronger than the doors that used to exist. it is very difficult--almost impossible--to breach those doors when they are closed, but the threat remains because on every long flight and on many short flights the doors are open. at some point during the course of the flight, pilots often get up and they get out of the cockpit. they have to go to the restroom or they go to get some food or a flight attendant goes in to check on the pilots or to bring them something they want. that moment when that door is opened, that door is no longer a barrier. therein lies the danger. there is the moment of opportunity for terrorists. the faa fully acknowledges the serious nature of this risk. in april of 2015, an faa advisory said the following: on long flights, as a matter of necessity, crewmembers must open the flight deck door to access lavatory facilities, to transfer meals to flightcrew members, or to switch crew positions for crew rest purposes. the opening and closing of the flight deck door (referred to as ``door transition''), reduces the protective anti-intrusion/anti-penetration benefits of the reinforced door. . . . during this door transition, the flight deck is vulnerable. of course, it is not only the faa that was able to figure this out. the terrorists understand this as well. the 9/11 commission report said this: ali sheikh mohammed told them-- and the ``them'' in this case refers to the terrorists he was instructing. ali sheikh mohammed told them to watch the cabin doors at takeoff and landing to observe whether the captain went to the lavatory during the flight and to note whether the flight attendants brought food into the cockpit. i continue to quote: the best time to storm the cockpit would be about 10 to 15 minutes after takeoff when the cockpit doors typically were opened for the first time. furthermore-- states the 9/11 commission report-- they had no firm contingency plans-- ``they'' being the terrorists-- in case the cockpit door was locked. they were confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider breaking them down a viable idea. since then, we have made the doors even more durable. it would be even more difficult to actually break down the door or otherwise open a closed door. the problem is when the door is open. this is not just a theoretical risk. since 9/11, there have been at least 51 attempts at cockpit breaches worldwide. five attempts have been successful. one successful attempt occurred in 2006 on turkish airlines flight 1476. terrorists were successful in entering the cockpit after a flight attendant opened the door to ask the pilots if they needed anything. so it seems to me unacceptable, when we have a readily available solution, to continue to take this risk. it is just common sense to install secondary barriers on commercial planes. these are inexpensive, several thousand dollars to install. they are lightweight and easy to use and very compact when they are not engaged. the only people who would be inconvenienced by these secondary barriers would be terrorists. had the secondary barriers, these kinds of barriers, been installed on 9/11, it would have made the job very difficult for the terrorists to ever get into the cockpit. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. i think this is a sensible amendment. the substance of this has been approved in the house. we ought to pass it on the senate floor and pass this faa reauthorization underlying bill. if we do that, in time, our skies will be that much safer. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from iowa proper role of a supreme court justice mr. grassley. mr. president, a significant number of americans believe the supreme court is highly politicized. its approval rating has fallen over the years, not surprisingly. its approval rating has dropped most drastically in recent years following the president's appointment of justices sotomayor and kagan. there are four justices who vote in a liberal way in effectively every case the public follows. there are two justices who stick to the constitutional text and who vote in a consistently conservative way. one justice votes mostly, but not always, in a conservative way, and one justice votes sometimes with the conservatives and sometimes with the liberals. all of the liberals were appointed by democrats, the conservatives and swing justices were appointed by a republican president, but in a speech shortly before justice scalia's death, chief justice roberts maintained that the public wrongly thinks justices view themselves as republicans or as democrats. of course, it is irrelevant to the public how the justices view themselves. what is troubling is that a large segment of the population views the justices as political. it is appropriate and instructive, then, to ask why the public takes this view and whether that view is warranted. i believe the public's perception is at least sometimes very warranted. the chief justice ruled out that this perception has anything to do with what the justices themselves have done. instead, he attributes it to the senate confirmation process. as he sees it, senators ``frequently ask us questions they know it would be inappropriate for us to answer. thankfully, we don't answer the questions.'' the chief justice also stated: when you have a sharply divided political divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms. you know, if the democrats and republicans have been fighting so fiercely about whether you're going to be confirmed, it's natural for some members of the public to think, well, you must be identified in a particular way as a result of that process. on the one hand, the chief justice identified precisely why it would be bad for the court and the nominee to move forward in the middle of a hotly contested presidential election campaign. as you have heard this senator say, it would be all politics and no constitution. of course, that was the thrust of another senator a few years back--chairman biden's argument in 1992. but in another respect, the chief justice has it exactly backwards. the confirmation process doesn't make the justices appear political. the confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the court itself has drifted from the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. in short, the justices themselves have gotten political, and because the justices' decisions are often political and transgress their constitutional role, the process becomes more political. in fact, many of my constituents believe, with all due respect, that the chief justice is part of this problem. they believe that a number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones. certainly, there are academics who agree. [[page s1662]] in a recent new york times article, academics appealed to the chief justice's political side. these academics asked him to intervene in the current supreme court vacancy, suggesting that it could be a so-called john marshall moment for chief justice roberts. that is a political temptation that the chief justice should resist. i can't think of anything any current justice could do to further damage respect for the court at this moment than to interject themselves into what chairman biden called the political ``cauldron'' of an election year supreme court vacancy. in a recent speech, the chief justice said: ``we're interpreting the law, not imposing our views.'' he further stated: ``if people don't like the explanation, or don't think it holds together, you know, then they're justified, i think, in viewing us as having transgressed the limits of our role.'' again, with all due respect to the chief justice, tens of millions of americans believe, correctly, that the supreme court has transgressed the limits of its role. tens of millions of americans believe, correctly, that too many of the justices are imposing their views and not interpreting the law. that is the major reason why we should have a debate about the proper role of a supreme court justice. we need to debate whether our current justices are adhering to their constitutional role. as the chief justice remarked, although many of the supreme court's decisions are unanimous or nearly so, the justices tend to disagree on what the chief justice called, in his words, the ``hot button issues.'' we all know what kinds of cases he has in mind when he talks about ``hot button issues''--freedom of religion, abortion, affirmative action, gun control, free speech, and the death penalty. one can probably name a lot of others. the chief justice was very revealing when he acknowledged that the lesser known cases are often unanimous, and the hot button cases are frequently 5 to 4. but why is that? the law is no more or less likely to be clear in a hot button case than another case. for those justices committed to the rule of law, it shouldn't be any harder to keep personal preferences out of a politically charged case than any other case. in some cases, the justices are all willing to follow the law, but in others where they are deeply invested in the policy implications of the ruling, those cases tend to turn out 5 to 4. the explanation of these 5-to-4 rulings must be that in hot button cases some of the justices are deciding based on their political preferences and not--as they should be--on the law. but if hot button cases are being decided by politicians in robes, then the supreme court has no more of a right than the voters to be the final word. the chief justice regrets that the american people believe the court is no different from the political branches of government. but again, and with respect, i think he is concerned with the wrong problem. he would be well-served to address the reality--not the perception--that too often there is little difference between the actions of the court and the actions of the political branches. so, physician, heal thyself. in case after 5-to-4 case, the justices who the democrats appointed vote for liberal policy results. this can't be a coincidence. democratic presidents know what they want when they nominate justices--justices who will reach politically liberal results regardless of what the law requires. this, of course, is what our current president means when he says that he wants justices to look to their ``heart'' to decide the really hard cases. that is an unambiguous invitation for justices to decide the hot button cases based on personal policy preferences. that, of course, isn't the law, and it is not the appropriate role for the court. it is no wonder, then, that the public believes the court is political. what democratic presidents want in this regard is what they get--even before justice scalia's death. leading scholars found this supreme court to be the most liberal since the 1960s. justices appointed by republicans are generally committed to following the law. there are justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. but some of the justices appointed even by republicans often don't vote in a way that advances conservative policy. contrary to what the chief justice suggested, a major reason the confirmation process has become more divisive is that some of the justices are voting too often based on politics and not on law. if they are going to be political actors after they are confirmed, then the confirmation process necessarily is going to reflect that dynamic. for instance, just last week, after one of my democratic colleagues met with judge garland, the senator said after discussing issues like reproductive rights: ``i actually feel quite confident that he is deserving of my support.'' obviously, i don't know what they discussed during that meeting or what judge garland said about reproductive rights, and, to be clear, i am not suggesting anything inappropriate was discussed. my point is this: if justices stuck to the constitutional text and didn't base decisions on their own policy preferences or what the president asked, based on what is in their heart or on empathy for a particular litigant, then senators wouldn't deem it necessary to understand whether the nominee supports reproductive rights or not. with this in mind, is it any wonder that the public believes the court is political? if we want the confirmation process to be less divisive, if we want the public to have more confidence that the justices haven't exceeded their constitutional role, then the justices themselves need to demonstrate that in politically sensitive cases their decisions are based on the constitution and the law and not on political preferences or what comes from the heart or because of some empathy. so here is where we are about the public perception of the court being political. when the justices return to their appropriate role of deciding cases based on the facts and the law, public perception of the court will take care of itself. i yield the floor. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (ms. ayotte). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",56975

Madam President, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, JROTC. On June 3, 1916, Congress passed the National Defense Act, establishing the JROTC. This program teaches students the values of our Armed Forces through training and classroom instruction with military personnel. This influential program encourages leadership, fortitude, and personal responsibility. The JROTC has experienced a long history of success, and millions of high school students have completed the program since its inception. Not only do these students learn military history and customs, but participants gain a deeper understanding of civic engagement, community service, and the importance of character building. Out of the many high school students who participate in JROTC each year, 30 to 50 percent go on to serve in the U.S. military later in life. The program also connects high school students with universities that offer the Reserve Officer Training Corps program and helps many students who may have not otherwise earned a college degree. I would also like to recognize the 35 schools in Colorado that offer the JROTC program. In Colorado, there are 2 Marine Corps JROTC units, 8 Air Force JROTC units, 4 Navy units, and 21 Army units. I am proud of the accomplishments of the JROTC students, and I know they have a bright future ahead of them.

Madam President, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, JROTC. On June 3, 1916, Congress passed the National Defense Act, establishing the JROTC. This program teaches students the values of our Armed Forces through training and classroom instruction with military personnel. This influential program encourages leadership, fortitude, and personal responsibility. The JROTC has experienced a long history of success, and millions of high school students have completed the program since its inception. Not only do these students learn military history and customs, but participants gain a deeper understanding of civic engagement, community service, and the importance of character building. Out of the many high school students who participate in JROTC each year, 30 to 50 percent go on to serve in the U.S. military later in life. The program also connects high school students with universities that offer the Reserve Officer Training Corps program and helps many students who may have not otherwise earned a college degree.

Arkansas Post was established as a trading post by Henri De Tonti in 1686 and was the first permanent European settlement in the lower Mississippi River valley. While the exact location moved several times, the area remained a vital trade center for much of the 17th and 18th centuries. The land was eventually ceded to Spain, who controlled the post for over 40 years. While under Spanish control, Arkansas Post was home to the Battle of Arkansas Post, a Revolutionary War battle between Spanish and British forces fought on April 17, 1783. Also known as the Colbert Raid, this battle was the only Revolutionary War battle to take place in what is today the State of Arkansas.

He passed away on March 27, at the age of 92. Gilbert Horn was born May 23, 1923, on the Fort Belknap Indian reservation in Montana. He was an Assiniboine chief, decorated war hero, WWII combat veteran, and code talker. In 1940 he entered the U.S. Army at the young age of 17. He was a member of the 163rd Infantry Battalion. Chief Horn received training in communication and encryption. He then volunteered to be a code talker using his native Assiniboine Tribe language to disguise U.S. military communications against the Japanese. He volunteered for the Merrill's Marauders, a deep penetration unit commanded by MG Frank Merrill. They spent 5 months of field operations in Burma and western China and completed an 800-mile journey across the Himalaya Mountains in order to cut Japanese communications and supply lines. Chief Horn survived the journey with chest, back, and jaw wounds. He was honorably discharged, having received the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star. After returning to the Fort Belknap Indian reservation he served as chairman and council member of the Fort Belknap Community Council.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: April 4, 2016. * As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act. POLICY JUSTIFICATION Australia--GBU-39 (Small Diameter Bomb Increment I) The Government of Australia has requested a possible sale of: Major Defense Equipment (MDE): Up to 2,950 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I). Up to 50 Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) with GBU-39 (T-1 )/B (Inert Fuze). This request also includes the following Non-MDE: containers, weapons system support equipment, support and test equipment, site survey, transportation, repair and return warranties, spare and repair parts, publications and technical data, maintenance, personnel training, and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor representative engineering, logistics, and technical support services, and other related elements of logistics support. The total estimated value of MDE is $172 million. The total overall estimated value is $386 million. Australia is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific. The strategic location of this political and economic power contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic stability in the region. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a major contributor to political stability, security, and economic development in the Pacific region and globally. The sale of SDB I supports and complements the on-going sale of the F-35 to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). This capability will strengthen combined operations and increase interoperability between the U.S. Air Force and the RAAF. Australia will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The principal contractor for production is Boeing in St. Louis, Missouri. The principal contractor for integration is unknown and will be determined during contract negotiations. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. or contractor representatives to Australia. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. Transmittal No. 16-23 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. Sensitive and/or classified (up to SECRET) elements of the proposed acquisition include hardware, accessories, components, and associated software: GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment I (SDB I). Additional sensitive areas include operating manuals and maintenance technical orders containing performance information, operating and test procedures, and other information related to the support operations and repair. The hardware, software, and data identified are classified to protect vulnerabilities, design and performance parameters, and other similar critical information. 2. The GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment T (SDB I) is a 250-pound class weapon designed as a small, all-weather, autonomous, conventional, air-to-ground, precision glide weapon able to strike fixed and stationary re-locatable targets from standoff range. The SDB I weapon system consists of the weapons, the BRU-61/A (4-place pneumatic carriage system), shipping and handling containers for a single weapon and the BRU-61/A either empty or loaded, and a weapon planning module. It has integrated diamond-back type wings that deploy after releases, which increases the glide time and therefore maximum range. The SDB I Anti-Jam Global Positioning System aided Inertial Navigation System (AJGPS/ INS) provides guidance to the coordinates of a stationary target. The payload/warhead is a very effective multipurpose penetrating and blast fragmentation warhead coupled with a cockpit selectable electronic fuze. Its size and accuracy allow for an effective munition with less collateral damage. A proximity sensor provides height of burst capability. 3. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology associated with this system as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 4. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for release and export to the Government of Australia. ____ Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, VA. Hon. Bob Corker, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 0J-16. This notification relates to enhancements or upgrades from the level of sensitivity of technology or capability described in the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 15-62 of 19 November 2015. Sincerely, Jennifer Zakriski, (for J.W. Rixey, Vice Admiral, USN, Director). Enclosures. Transmittal No. 0J-16 Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(A), AECA) i. Purchaser: Government of Japan. ii. Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 15-62; Date: 19 November 2015; Military Department: Air Force. iii. Description: On 19 November 2015, Congress was notified by Congressional certification transmittal number 15-62, of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act of three (3) RQ-4 Block 30 (I) Global Hawk Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), each with Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS), eight (8) Kearfott Inertial Navigation System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) units (2 per aircraft with 2 spares), and eight (8) LN-251 INS/GPS units (2 per aircraft with 2 spares). Also included with this request are operational-level sensor and aircraft test equipment, ground support equipment, operational flight test support, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, personnel training, publications and technical data, U.S. Government and contractor technical and logistics support services, and other related elements of logistics support. The total value of this sale is $1.2 billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constitutes $689 million of this sale. This transmittal reports the inclusion of two Ground Control Elements (GCE). The GCEs were not enumerated as MDE in the original notification of the Global Hawk RPA system. Inclusion of this equipment as MDE will increase the MDE cost by $31 million, resulting in a revised MDE cost of $720 million. The total case value will remain $1.2 billion. iv. Significance: This notification is being provided as the GCEs were not enumerated as MDE in the original notification. Their inclusion does not necessarily represent an increase in capability over what was notified, but properly identifies the equipment required for Global Hawk operations. This equipment provides the Japan Air Self- Defense Force (JASDF) a ground control station from which to fly and execute Global Hawk surveillance missions. Overall, these systems meet the requirements of providing the JASDF with the ability to conduct high-altitude surveillance and reconnaissance without exposing JASDF personnel to the dangers inherent to high-altitude ISR operations. v. Justification: This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by meeting the security and defense needs of an ally and partner nation. Japan continues to be an important force for peace, political stability, and economic progress in East Asia and the Western Pacific. The proposed sale of the RQ-4 will significantly enhance Japan's intelligence, surveillance, and [[Page S1664]] reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and help ensure that Japan is able to continue to monitor and deter regional threats. The JASDF will have no difficulty absorbing these systems into its armed forces. vi.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION Australia--GBU-39 (Small Diameter Bomb Increment I) The Government of Australia has requested a possible sale of: Major Defense Equipment (MDE): Up to 2,950 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I). Up to 50 Guided Test Vehicles (GTV) with GBU-39 (T-1 )/B (Inert Fuze). This request also includes the following Non-MDE: containers, weapons system support equipment, support and test equipment, site survey, transportation, repair and return warranties, spare and repair parts, publications and technical data, maintenance, personnel training, and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor representative engineering, logistics, and technical support services, and other related elements of logistics support. The total estimated value of MDE is $172 million. The total overall estimated value is $386 million. Australia is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific. The strategic location of this political and economic power contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic stability in the region. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a major contributor to political stability, security, and economic development in the Pacific region and globally. The sale of SDB I supports and complements the on-going sale of the F-35 to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). This capability will strengthen combined operations and increase interoperability between the U.S. Air Force and the RAAF. Australia will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The principal contractor for production is Boeing in St. Louis, Missouri. The principal contractor for integration is unknown and will be determined during contract negotiations. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. or contractor representatives to Australia. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. Transmittal No. 16-23 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. Sensitive and/or classified (up to SECRET) elements of the proposed acquisition include hardware, accessories, components, and associated software: GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment I (SDB I). Additional sensitive areas include operating manuals and maintenance technical orders containing performance information, operating and test procedures, and other information related to the support operations and repair. The hardware, software, and data identified are classified to protect vulnerabilities, design and performance parameters, and other similar critical information. 2. The GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment T (SDB I) is a 250-pound class weapon designed as a small, all-weather, autonomous, conventional, air-to-ground, precision glide weapon able to strike fixed and stationary re-locatable targets from standoff range. The SDB I weapon system consists of the weapons, the BRU-61/A (4-place pneumatic carriage system), shipping and handling containers for a single weapon and the BRU-61/A either empty or loaded, and a weapon planning module. It has integrated diamond-back type wings that deploy after releases, which increases the glide time and therefore maximum range. The SDB I Anti-Jam Global Positioning System aided Inertial Navigation System (AJGPS/ INS) provides guidance to the coordinates of a stationary target. The payload/warhead is a very effective multipurpose penetrating and blast fragmentation warhead coupled with a cockpit selectable electronic fuze. Its size and accuracy allow for an effective munition with less collateral damage. A proximity sensor provides height of burst capability. 3. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology associated with this system as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 4. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for release and export to the Government of Australia. ____ Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Arlington, VA. Hon. Bob Corker, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 0J-16. This notification relates to enhancements or upgrades from the level of sensitivity of technology or capability described in the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 15-62 of 19 November 2015. Sincerely, Jennifer Zakriski, (for J.W. Rixey, Vice Admiral, USN, Director). Enclosures.

Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 15-62; Date: 19 November 2015; Military Department: Air Force. iii. Description: On 19 November 2015, Congress was notified by Congressional certification transmittal number 15-62, of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act of three (3) RQ-4 Block 30 (I) Global Hawk Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), each with Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS), eight (8) Kearfott Inertial Navigation System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) units (2 per aircraft with 2 spares), and eight (8) LN-251 INS/GPS units (2 per aircraft with 2 spares). Also included with this request are operational-level sensor and aircraft test equipment, ground support equipment, operational flight test support, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, personnel training, publications and technical data, U.S. Government and contractor technical and logistics support services, and other related elements of logistics support. The total value of this sale is $1.2 billion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constitutes $689 million of this sale. This transmittal reports the inclusion of two Ground Control Elements (GCE). The GCEs were not enumerated as MDE in the original notification of the Global Hawk RPA system. Inclusion of this equipment as MDE will increase the MDE cost by $31 million, resulting in a revised MDE cost of $720 million. The total case value will remain $1.2 billion. iv. Significance: This notification is being provided as the GCEs were not enumerated as MDE in the original notification. Their inclusion does not necessarily represent an increase in capability over what was notified, but properly identifies the equipment required for Global Hawk operations. This equipment provides the Japan Air Self- Defense Force (JASDF) a ground control station from which to fly and execute Global Hawk surveillance missions. Overall, these systems meet the requirements of providing the JASDF with the ability to conduct high-altitude surveillance and reconnaissance without exposing JASDF personnel to the dangers inherent to high-altitude ISR operations. v. Justification: This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by meeting the security and defense needs of an ally and partner nation. Japan continues to be an important force for peace, political stability, and economic progress in East Asia and the Western Pacific. The proposed sale of the RQ-4 will significantly enhance Japan's intelligence, surveillance, and [[Page S1664]] reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and help ensure that Japan is able to continue to monitor and deter regional threats. The JASDF will have no difficulty absorbing these systems into its armed forces. vi.

CREC-2016-04-05-pt1-PgS1665-2,CREC-2016-04-05,114,TRIBUTE TO MANSOUR KARIM,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1665] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MANSOUR KARIM Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I recognize Mansour Karim of Pierre, SD. Mr. Karim's life story is inspiring, and his contributions to his community and the State of South Dakota are worthy of commendation. Born and raised in Tehran, Iran, to a poor family, Mr. Karim dreamed of moving to the United States to pursue his higher education. That dream became a reality in November of 1950, when Mr. Karim arrived at the Port of New York and New Jersey with a limited English vocabulary and only $27 in his pocket. He had originally planned to attend the University of Michigan, but was worried that the growing Iranian immigrant population there would keep him from being immersed in the culture of the United States. He decided to study at Huron College in Huron, SD. Mr. Karim's journey to South Dakota was challenged by the barriers of an unfamiliar nation, but he had his faith and was often helped by strangers along the way. He studied at Huron College for a year before transferring to South Dakota State College, now known as South Dakota State University, from which he graduated in 1955 with a degree in civil engineering. He would later receive his master's degree in engineering from the same school. Mr. Karim served 35 years with the South Dakota Department of Transportation in South Dakota's capital city of Pierre. Though a dedicated civil servant, he found his passion doing something he never could have done in his home country of Iran. He invested in rental properties, starting modestly. Eventually, through hard work, wise investment, and trusted relationships, he achieved great success in providing affordable, quality rentals for residents in the Pierre area. Mr. Karim did not do this alone. His wife, Ruth, provided support to the enterprise as the two of them raised their seven children. Ruth Karim cofounded South Dakota Right to Life and served as its executive director for 19 years. Prior to Ruth passing away in 2013, Mr. Karim worked with the Saint Mary's Foundation in Pierre to set up the Ruth Karim Endowment that would help nursing students who value protecting the sanctity of life and fund their education at Ruth's alma mater, the University of South Dakota. When looking back on his life, Mr. Karim is quick to recognize those who helped him move to South Dakota. He also remembers how, as a young child, he gave a beggar a penny, though he wished he had been able to give more. That giving nature has continued throughout his life, with Mr. Karim having given more than $2 million to charities throughout South Dakota, with a focus on education and children's needs. He created the Mansour and Ruth Karim Scholarship Endowment in 2004 at South Dakota State University. Due to these charitable contributions Mr. Karim has been the recipient of many awards, including being named Pierre's Outstanding Philanthropist of the Year in 2011. I, like the residents of Pierre and others across South Dakota, have had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Karim. His passion for the United States and the freedoms it affords and his genuine care for his community is contagious. In conversations, Mr. Karim will often say that his experience could only be possible in the United States. His story is another real-life example of the American dream as reality and what makes our Nation great, to succeed and to give back, so that others may succeed. It is for these reasons that I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Mr. Karim for his generous philanthropic work and thank him for making South Dakota his home. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1665] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MANSOUR KARIM Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, today I wish to honor the life of my friend Hilliard Fletcher of Tuscaloosa, AL, who passed away on March 13, 2016. He will be remembered as a skilled businessman, a devoted public servant, and a man who deeply cared about the city of Tuscaloosa. A native of Mobile, Hilliard graduated from the University of Alabama in 1957. He went on to serve our country as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps and served for 14 years in the Reserves, retiring with the rank of major. Hilliard was the president of Duckworth-Morris Insurance Company and also served with distinction four terms as finance and waterworks commissioner on the Tuscaloosa City Commission. During those 16 years, he played an instrumental role in the creation of the mayor-council model of municipal government that we know today. He was also influential in the efforts that led to Congress passing the Lake Tuscaloosa Protection Act, which prevented the Federal Government from installing a hydroelectric powerplant on Lake Tuscaloosa's dam in 1970. In addition to his many years of service to the city of Tuscaloosa, Hilliard was a true leader in his community--serving on numerous boards and working with various charitable and business organizations. He served on the board of directors of First Alabama Bank, was the president of the United Way of West Alabama, and was president and director of the Exchange Club of Tuscaloosa. He also served as a board member and officer of the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama, was a member of the board of directors and membership chairman of the YMCA of Tuscaloosa, and was the Chairman of the Heart Fund Drive. Hilliard was on the DCH Foundation Board, was director of the Alabama League of Municipalities, and was a deacon of First Presbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa. Hilliard's many accomplishments, as well as his contributions to the city of Tuscaloosa and West Alabama, will not be soon forgotten. Tuscaloosa named the city's wastewater treatment plant after him in 1998. The Community Foundation of West Alabama named him a ``Pillar of West Alabama'' in 2010 for his dedicated efforts and service to the area. The city of Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama were fortunate to have a leader and a great man like Hilliard Fletcher, and he will be sorely missed. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Betty; his daughter, Beth Lubin; and his sons, Douglas and Curtis, as they celebrate his many life accomplishments and mourn this great loss. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1665] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING HILLIARD FLETCHER Mr. SHELBY.

Madam President, in recent weeks our State has faced disastrous storms and flooding, but with true Louisiana strength, families and communities are already banding together for the recovery. In that spirit, I would like to recognize Delta Interiors and Gifts as small business of the week whose community has rallied together to respond to and recover from the recent storms. In 1976, John and Martha Peters founded Delta Interiors and Gifts in their hometown of Homer in northwest Louisiana with the goal of providing quality interior design services and unique gifts to clients in their community. Offering additional services in custom drapery and design in their factory in Homer, they produce draperies, hospital curtains, blinds, and other items for hotels and hospitals nationwide, from Massachusetts to Washington to California to Florida. One of their most well-known projects was providing the interior designs for the historic Waldorf Astoria hotel in New Orleans. Today, the company boasts a statewide and nationwide clientele, largely due to their commitment to personally measuring, producing, and installing each order that many large corporations sometimes cannot provide. The company has earned a reputation among large hotel brands, enabling Delta Interiors to grow and employ more and more local workers in their manufacturing factory. In the aftermath of a strong upper level storm system that brought dangerous thunderstorms and flooding across Louisiana this month, the Peters found themselves in a seemingly impossible situation: their life's business was literally underwater. The Homer community came together to help the Peters recover all undamaged products and remove what had been destroyed by the rising water. With friends, family, and neighbors coming to their aid, the Peters have been inspired to pick up the pieces and rebuild their small business. In the next several months, countless businesses like Delta Interiors will put the pieces of their businesses back together again with the help of family, friends, and neighbors. As the Peters family and their team at Delta Interiors rebuild after these disastrous storms, I am honored to name Delta Interiors as small business of the week, and I wish them a quick recovery and many more years of growth and success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 51 (Tuesday, April 5, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1666] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DELTA INTERIORS AND GIFTS Mr. VITTER.
