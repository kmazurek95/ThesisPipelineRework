CREC-2016-04-07-pt1-PgS1775-8,CREC-2016-04-07,114,FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1775-S1776] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, President Obama will fly to Chicago, where he will try to convince Americans that, despite his own actions while in the Senate to deny a Supreme Court nominee a vote, the Constitution somehow now requires the Senate to have a vote on his nominee no matter what, and thereby deny the American people a voice in the future of the Supreme Court. In the words of the Washington Post's Fact Checker, he will be ``telling supporters a politically convenient fairy tale.'' That is the Washington Post. I am sure he will gloss over the fact that the decision about filling this pivotal seat could impact our country for decades, that it could dramatically affect the most cherished constitutional rights, such as those contained in the First and Second Amendments. I am sure he will continue to demand that Washington spend its time fighting on one issue where we don't agree rather than working together on issues where we do. I am sure he will spend some time refuting the words of his own Vice President. I am sure he will repeatedly claim that his nominee is ``moderate''--not that he means it; it is just a useful piece of spin that has been dutifully echoed across the spans of the left and in the media for years. Consider the recent Democratic Supreme Court nominees. One Washington Post columnist hailed the ``moderate'' record of President Obama's first pick to the Supreme Court. One New York newspaper proclaimed his second nominee a ``pragmatic centrist.'' When President Clinton made his Supreme Court nominations, the Post declared one a--you guessed it--``moderate,'' and the New York Times practically fell all over itself exalting the ``resolutely centrist'' style of the other. That last nominee--who said it would be a good idea to abolish Mother's Day, by the way--was not just firmly centrist, not [[Page S1776]] just decisively centrist, but resolutely centrist, in the Times' opinion. The records of every one of these Supreme Court Justices have been anything--anything--but moderate or centrist in the years since. They have been resolutely leftwing. But that is the point. ``Moderate'' isn't exactly a true descriptor for Democratic Supreme Court nominees; it is just burned into the printing presses of the editorial boards. Yet, even the New York Times has had to admit that President Obama's current nominee would give Americans the most leftwing Supreme Court in 50 years--in 50 years. That is why the far left is squarely behind President Obama's campaign to deny the American people a say in this momentous decision. The American people understand what is at stake. The administration doesn't want the American people messing this up for them, and they will say what they always say to get what they want today: a far-left Supreme Court for decades to come. That is just one more reason why the American people are lucky to have a Judiciary chairman like Senator Grassley in their corner. Senator Grassley is passionate about giving the people of this country a voice in such a critical conversation. He has stood strong for the people throughout this debate, and he has proven himself a dedicated legislator throughout this new majority, with yet another Judiciary Committee-passed bill clearing the Senate on a bipartisan basis just this week. He understands that we don't need to get stuck fighting about one issue. He understands that we can let the American people have their voices heard on this matter while the Senate continues doing its work on important legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1775-S1776] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I agree with the Republican leader that it is important that we get the FAA bill done as soon as possible, but I would just have everyone reflect--when we were in the majority, we tried to bring up the FAA bill, and that went on for weeks and weeks, with unnecessary filibusters. The FAA came to a screeching halt. As we have said, if you are a responsible minority, you work to get things done. That is what we have done. We have worked hard with the majority to come up with an FAA bill we can support. So I hope everyone understands that obstruction doesn't work. We understand that. That is why we have tried to be as collegial as we can be on legislation. I just finished my ``Welcome to Washington'' this morning. A little boy asked me: How do you get things done? I said: Well, you know, things in Congress are done just like in life. I have had the good fortune in my time in public service, my time in Congress, to be able to have things with my name on them, bills that have passed, but I have never ever gotten something that I wanted--it was always a compromise. We always have had to compromise to get something passed. Frankly, that is the way life is. Life is a time where we work with people to try to get along to work things out. That is the way things used to be done here, but with the untoward obstruction during the Obama years, it has been difficult to get things done. So I agree that the FAA bill is something we need to pass. As I have said, we are constructively working with the Republicans--those on the other side of the aisle--to get things done. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1776] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I was deeply saddened by the death of Lexington, KY, native Stephanie Moore Shults. Ms. Shults, 29, along with her husband Justin Shults, 30, was killed in the terrorist attacks in Brussels last month. Funeral services for the young couple will be held in Lexington tomorrow. Stephanie Shults graduated from Bryan Station High School and Transylvania University and was looking forward to the promising future ahead of her. She found part of that future when she met Justin, a native of Tennessee, at Vanderbilt University, where the two earned their master's in accounting. The pair moved to Brussels in 2014 for work and loved to travel extensively through Europe. They recently visited Barcelona. They were planning a future trip to Finland, where they hoped to stay in a glass igloo under the Northern Lights. Now that spirit of adventure is gone, stolen by a brutal act of terror that targeted the innocent. My wife Elaine and I join all Kentuckians in sending our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of this young couple. We share their heartbreak over the fact that Stephanie and Justin were taken from us entirely too soon. And we extend our prayers and sympathies to all the families who lost loved ones in Belgium. Attacks like these remind Americans everywhere that we must defeat ISIL and other terrorist groups who not only threaten our interests but critically, importantly, threaten innocent civilians. Today we honor the lives of Stephanie and Justin. We mourn their loss.

Mr. President, we can play around all we want with the Supreme Court and what the Constitution says or doesn't say, but we know that the Constitution says that the President shall--not may, but shall--nominate Supreme Court Justices. He has an obligation. He has to do that. The Constitution is also very affirmative: There has to be advice and consent. That is what we are instructed in the Constitution. It is a little strange how we can have from the Republicans advice and consent when the vast majority of the Republicans won't even meet with the man. They refuse to hold hearings and certainly to have a vote. So I don't know how anyone is reading the Constitution, but we need to do our job. We are not doing our job when we don't hold hearings and have a vote. We shouldn't be here talking about Supreme Court nominees being far left or far right or moderate. To show how off track this has gotten, 2 days ago the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Iowa, gave a speech here. Guess who he was attacking. Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He said to the Chief Justice: Heal yourself. The Chief Justice. Is there anyone in the world--anyone in the United States, anyone in the legal field, anyone in the political field--who thinks he is some kind of crazy liberal, John Roberts, who worked on the court with Merrick Garland? They wrote opinions together. They agreed almost 90 percent of the time on their opinions. So it is really too bad that now we are here with a Supreme Court Justice--for the first time in the history of the country, because we are in the final year of a Presidency, we are not going to do anything. We are going to wait. In the meantime, justice will be delayed. We have already had a significant number of tied, 4-to-4 decisions by the Court, and, using the logic of the Republicans, this is going to go on for another 18 months. So it is unfortunate that this has turned into something that has never happened before. They go back and keep repeating: The Biden rule. The Biden rule. The Biden rule. The year he gave that speech--and he gave a speech at Georgetown University just a week ago saying: Read my speech. Read the whole thing. And what was the result of his action as chairman of the committee that year? He brought nominations to the floor even though they didn't get enough votes in the committee to be reported. The nominees lost in the Judiciary Committee, but Biden brought them here anyway. There was an op-ed written by one of my predecessors, former Democratic leader George Mitchell, a stunningly good Senator from Maine. He wrote that 2 days ago. It appeared in a Boston newspaper. He said that when Clarence Thomas came before the Senate, he had lost in the committee. He didn't get enough votes to be reported out of the [[Page S1777]] committee. Biden reported him out anyway: Bring him to the floor. Let's have a debate. That is what Senator Mitchell talked about. We had a debate. And he had pressure. It wasn't tremendous, but he had pressure. People asked: Why don't you filibuster him? He said: I am not going to filibuster. Let's have a vote, and that is the way it used to be done. He had 52 votes. Could that have been stopped? Of course. Would the Court have been better? Observers can make the determination themselves as to whether we would be better off without Clarence Thomas on that Court.

Mr. President, I am gratified that the Presiding Officer today is from the State of Nevada--my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada. When I think of home, I think of the desert, and you can't talk about Nevada as a desert only, even though the vast majority of the State of Nevada is a very arid place. Nevada also has beautiful Sierra Nevada--the Ruby Mountains. We are the most mountainous State in the Union except for Alaska. We have 314 separate mountain ranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. We have one mountain that we share with California that is almost 14,000 feet high. It is a beautiful State, but today I am going to focus on some of those arid places--the place where I was born and raised. Having been back here such a long time--37 years--I often think of the blue skies in Nevada. They hover over a beautiful canvas. No one can paint a picture as beautiful as these mountains, which are in the middle of the desert, Joshua trees, or sagebrush. It is that beauty that is drawing thousands of visitors to Nevada and Nevada's wilderness every year. Yesterday, the Reno Gazette-Journal had a tremendous article that reported just how important this quiet recreational industry is to our country. They said: The big time solitude found in the big empty spaces of the western U.S. generates big money for regional economies. That's according to a study that attempts to put a dollar value on ``quiet recreation'' on Bureau of Land Management property. That is an editorial comment by me: ``quiet recreation.'' People are now biking, packing, and camping. Quiet is what is referred to as when there are no motorized vehicles. To continue the quote: It found that sports like hiking and mountain biking on BLM land generated more than $1.8 billion in spending in 2014, that's roughly equivalent to two months of gambling revenue in Las Vegas casinos. Our public lands are jewels that we must protect. To its credit, the Bureau of Land Management--when I was first elected here, the BLM was the hiss and cry of government. They were on par with the Internal Revenue Service. No one liked them, but now they are admired. They have done a remarkably good job in taking care of public lands. As I said, to their credit, the BLM and their dedicated employees do a remarkable job in safeguarding these national treasures so that all Americans can enjoy them. John Sterling, the executive director of The Conservation Alliance, told the Reno Gazette-Journal: The BLM is the final frontier for a primitive experience on our public lands. They represent the future of outdoor recreation. Unfortunately, there is a growing threat to these public lands and to the Americans who protect and preserve those areas. Most Americans are familiar with what happened earlier this year in Oregon when the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon was taken over when a dangerous group of militants staged an armed takeover of the refuge. They came with their canvas shirts, camouflaged pants, guns, assault rifles, and pistols that were obvious. They had their all- terrain vehicles and set out to take over this Federal property, and they did. They damaged it to the tune of about--we don't know for sure--$20 million. They defecated on some of the ruins and different facilities. They stopped the Indians from being able to do their annual fishing. I am sorry to say this particular episode of domestic terrorism has roots in Nevada. Ammon and Ryan Bundy--who are now in jail, which is where they should be--are the sons of Cliven Bundy. They were two of the participants in the unlawful takeover. Cliven Bundy is, of course, a Nevadan and has been breaking Federal laws for decades. I have been disappointed that some of my colleagues have supported this outrageous lawbreaker. Teddy Roosevelt created the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. This radical President, Theodore Roosevelt--and I say that sarcastically because he was, in fact, a great President--created the refuge in 1908. Roosevelt used the tools at his disposal as President of this great country, including the Antiquities Act, in order to protect our national heritage so that generations of Americans could enjoy it, as they have for more than 100 years in Oregon. Congress created the Antiquities Act to empower the President to protect our cultural, historic, and natural resources when and where Congress cannot--or will not. These cultural resources are stunning. For more than 100 years Presidents have done just what Theodore Roosevelt did. Our current national parks were created using this authority--not all of them, but some of them. In fact, 16 Presidents--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans--have used this authority to protect lands for the benefit of the American people. The younger George Bush used the Antiquities Act. Republican Presidents have been doing this a lot, but unfortunately many Senate Republicans want to undermine this act. They refuse to defend our cultural and historic antiquities that are being systematically destroyed. That is why the Antiquities Act was created-- to safeguard against these threats in the absence of congressional action. Take, for example, a stunningly beautiful place called Gold Butte, the area where Cliven Bundy illegally grazed his cattle for decades. It is a stunning landscape. Is this worth protecting? This chart shows the beautiful landscape. Look at it. This picture is not doctored up; that is the way it is. The sky isn't as blue as I have seen it so many times. We don't get a lot of clouds in Nevada, especially in this part of Nevada. We don't get many storm clouds. It doesn't happen often, but this is part of the greatness of Nevada. Look at that. Is that worth preserving? Of course it is. This State has such magnificent areas. There are sandstone formations just like these petroglyphs, which date back thousands of years. Take a look at this. This is a picture of petroglyphs. These Indian writings and drawings are centuries old. They are in an area we want to protect--Gold Butte. Look at that. The picture shows panel after panel of this magnificent part of history. But because of the trouble caused by the Bundys and their pals, the Federal employees have been prevented from doing their job of safeguarding these antiquities. About 19 of the vandals have been indicted. Most of them are still in jail where they belong. These employees have been under constant physical and mental threat for doing what the American people have asked them to do--that is their job. Petroglyphs are being destroyed, drawn over, shot at, and stolen. This is an example of one panel they have destroyed. Look at what they have done. We can see that there are bullet holes. There is graffiti all over these beautiful Indian writings. These are not bricks that have been put in place. This is the way that nature has created this land, and they are destroying it. Look at what they have done. They have also cut pieces out of this and hauled them away. It is a crime, but they are criminals. They don't mind doing it, and that is what they do. What a shame. This is only one example, and it is right here in the middle of the picture. It was, frankly, a vulgar drawing. They knew what they were drawing. They were telling everybody how they felt about this antiquity. We can see the bullet holes here. They used it for target practice. The final picture I will show is the damage that was done to the Joshua trees. I know a lot about Joshua trees because where I lived and had my home for many years--and I still own quite a bit of property in Searchlight--has one of the thickest Joshua tree forests in [[Page S1778]] the world. These trees are stunning. They grow about two inches a year. They last for up to 150 years. People don't understand that these trees are so terrific. These trees have been brutalized by these criminals. They chopped this one down. One of my staffers said: Well, maybe they used it for firewood. Well, folks, have you ever tried to start a fire with cantaloupe? You can't burn this. I guess you can burn anything, but you will not stay warm. They are soft inside. It is not something you can burn. We don't know how old the tree in this picture was, but it was probably 80 or 100 years old. Look at that beautiful tree behind it. It is really unfortunate, but that is what they are doing. They are just destroying these beautiful trees. One of them who was part of the Oregon crowd had a brand. He went out branding everything with his brand. He stamped his brand on different things that should be protected. This is sad. I have tried to protect Gold Butte for a long time, and the reason we haven't been able to do anything up to this point is that the Bundy boys and their pals kept everybody off of that property, and that is why I am grateful for the Antiquities Act. Because of this legislation, the Bundys are in jail. I will reach out to the White House--and there is no guarantee we will get it done, that's for sure--to see if President Obama will protect this area. He has the authority, as any President does, to stop this sort of destruction and stop it now. Threats to our public lands are threats to our economy, our environment, and our culture. When we preserve our lands, we preserve America, and that is what we are trying to do: Preserve this beautiful place. I say again: Is this worth protecting and preserving? Of course it is. Mr. President, please announce the Senate business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1777-S1778] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING AMERICA'S PUBLIC LANDS Mr. REID.

are no motorized vehicles. to continue the quote: it found that sports like hiking and mountain biking on blm land generated more than $1.8 billion in spending in 2014, that's roughly equivalent to two months of gambling revenue in las vegas casinos. our public lands are jewels that we must protect. to its credit, the bureau of land management--when i was first elected here, the blm was the hiss and cry of government. they were on par with the internal revenue service. no one liked them, but now they are admired. they have done a remarkably good job in taking care of public lands. as i said, to their credit, the blm and their dedicated employees do a remarkable job in safeguarding these national treasures so that all americans can enjoy them. john sterling, the executive director of the conservation alliance, told the reno gazette-journal: the blm is the final frontier for a primitive experience on our public lands. they represent the future of outdoor recreation. unfortunately, there is a growing threat to these public lands and to the americans who protect and preserve those areas. most americans are familiar with what happened earlier this year in oregon when the malheur national wildlife refuge in southeastern oregon was taken over when a dangerous group of militants staged an armed takeover of the refuge. they came with their canvas shirts, camouflaged pants, guns, assault rifles, and pistols that were obvious. they had their all- terrain vehicles and set out to take over this federal property, and they did. they damaged it to the tune of about--we don't know for sure--$20 million. they defecated on some of the ruins and different facilities. they stopped the indians from being able to do their annual fishing. i am sorry to say this particular episode of domestic terrorism has roots in nevada. ammon and ryan bundy--who are now in jail, which is where they should be--are the sons of cliven bundy. they were two of the participants in the unlawful takeover. cliven bundy is, of course, a nevadan and has been breaking federal laws for decades. i have been disappointed that some of my colleagues have supported this outrageous lawbreaker. teddy roosevelt created the malheur national wildlife refuge in oregon. this radical president, theodore roosevelt--and i say that sarcastically because he was, in fact, a great president--created the refuge in 1908. roosevelt used the tools at his disposal as president of this great country, including the antiquities act, in order to protect our national heritage so that generations of americans could enjoy it, as they have for more than 100 years in oregon. congress created the antiquities act to empower the president to protect our cultural, historic, and natural resources when and where congress cannot--or will not. these cultural resources are stunning. for more than 100 years presidents have done just what theodore roosevelt did. our current national parks were created using this authority--not all of them, but some of them. in fact, 16 presidents--8 democrats and 8 republicans--have used this authority to protect lands for the benefit of the american people. the younger george bush used the antiquities act. republican presidents have been doing this a lot, but unfortunately many senate republicans want to undermine this act. they refuse to defend our cultural and historic antiquities that are being systematically destroyed. that is why the antiquities act was created-- to safeguard against these threats in the absence of congressional action. take, for example, a stunningly beautiful place called gold butte, the area where cliven bundy illegally grazed his cattle for decades. it is a stunning landscape. is this worth protecting? this chart shows the beautiful landscape. look at it. this picture is not doctored up; that is the way it is. the sky isn't as blue as i have seen it so many times. we don't get a lot of clouds in nevada, especially in this part of nevada. we don't get many storm clouds. it doesn't happen often, but this is part of the greatness of nevada. look at that. is that worth preserving? of course it is. this state has such magnificent areas. there are sandstone formations just like these petroglyphs, which date back thousands of years. take a look at this. this is a picture of petroglyphs. these indian writings and drawings are centuries old. they are in an area we want to protect--gold butte. look at that. the picture shows panel after panel of this magnificent part of history. but because of the trouble caused by the bundys and their pals, the federal employees have been prevented from doing their job of safeguarding these antiquities. about 19 of the vandals have been indicted. most of them are still in jail where they belong. these employees have been under constant physical and mental threat for doing what the american people have asked them to do--that is their job. petroglyphs are being destroyed, drawn over, shot at, and stolen. this is an example of one panel they have destroyed. look at what they have done. we can see that there are bullet holes. there is graffiti all over these beautiful indian writings. these are not bricks that have been put in place. this is the way that nature has created this land, and they are destroying it. look at what they have done. they have also cut pieces out of this and hauled them away. it is a crime, but they are criminals. they don't mind doing it, and that is what they do. what a shame. this is only one example, and it is right here in the middle of the picture. it was, frankly, a vulgar drawing. they knew what they were drawing. they were telling everybody how they felt about this antiquity. we can see the bullet holes here. they used it for target practice. the final picture i will show is the damage that was done to the joshua trees. i know a lot about joshua trees because where i lived and had my home for many years--and i still own quite a bit of property in searchlight--has one of the thickest joshua tree forests in [[page s1778]] the world. these trees are stunning. they grow about two inches a year. they last for up to 150 years. people don't understand that these trees are so terrific. these trees have been brutalized by these criminals. they chopped this one down. one of my staffers said: well, maybe they used it for firewood. well, folks, have you ever tried to start a fire with cantaloupe? you can't burn this. i guess you can burn anything, but you will not stay warm. they are soft inside. it is not something you can burn. we don't know how old the tree in this picture was, but it was probably 80 or 100 years old. look at that beautiful tree behind it. it is really unfortunate, but that is what they are doing. they are just destroying these beautiful trees. one of them who was part of the oregon crowd had a brand. he went out branding everything with his brand. he stamped his brand on different things that should be protected. this is sad. i have tried to protect gold butte for a long time, and the reason we haven't been able to do anything up to this point is that the bundy boys and their pals kept everybody off of that property, and that is why i am grateful for the antiquities act. because of this legislation, the bundys are in jail. i will reach out to the white house--and there is no guarantee we will get it done, that's for sure--to see if president obama will protect this area. he has the authority, as any president does, to stop this sort of destruction and stop it now. threats to our public lands are threats to our economy, our environment, and our culture. when we preserve our lands, we preserve america, and that is what we are trying to do: preserve this beautiful place. i say again: is this worth protecting and preserving? of course it is. mr. president, please announce the senate business of the day. ____________________",9760

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 636, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 636) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. Pending: Thune/Nelson amendment No. 3464, in the nature of a substitute. Thune (for Gardner) amendment No. 3460 (to amendment No. 3464), to require the FAA Administrator to consider the operational history of a person before authorizing the person to operate certain unmanned aircraft systems. Thune amendment No. 3512 (to amendment No. 3464), to enhance airport security. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have the FAA bill on the floor. I would like to discuss some of the amendments that are proposed and, hopefully, a couple that we will be voting on this morning. There are a couple of amendments--one offered by Senator Thune on behalf of himself and this Senator, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, and another offered by Senator Heinrich. Both amendments deal with the issue of security but in different arenas. Let me explain. The Thune-Nelson amendment applies to the question of perimeter security, of allowing employees to get into an airport--not the sterile area controlled by TSA, although, as I will explain, it can definitely affect the sterile area as well. On the other hand, the Heinrich amendment addresses security in the areas where passengers bunch up outside of TSA security, such as in a queue-up line going through TSA security, or passengers bunched up at the ticket counters, checking in their luggage. Either way, as we saw from the experience of the Brussels airport explosion, those are very tempting targets for a terrorist. Therefore, the proposal in the Heinrich amendment, which I would commend to the Senate, is to increase the level of security, particularly with what are called VIPR teams, which, in essence, are not only at airports but at seaports and at transportation hubs. Remember that in Brussels there was a bombing in one of the train stations as well. So we need to increase the surveillance and the security there, including dogs. As a matter of fact, our K-9 friends are some of the best that we have when it comes to protecting us because their noses are attuned to being able to sniff out the explosives that you cannot detect with metal detectors or with the AIT machine that we go through where we hold up our hands to see if we have anything on us. It can detect if you have a package, if you have an explosive that is somewhere in one of your body cavities. It is going to be very, very difficult. Dogs, because of their God-given sense of smell, can detect that. A properly trained dog is just amazing to watch. Now, interestingly, concurrently there is research going on at NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, for an artificial dog nose, a mechanical item or a piece of software and hardware that would actually do the same job. But that has not been perfected yet. That is going to be really interesting to see what they come up with. This Senator will report to the Senate later on that. But for the time being, the Heinrich amendment, which I hope we will vote on this morning, is concerned with that security that we have seen as a result of the Brussels bombing. We certainly want to enhance security in our airports. Thank goodness we have the intelligence apparatus that we do in this country to be able to smoke out the terrorist before he ever does his dirty deed. It is more difficult for them to do it here in America than it is in Europe because of the alienation of those communities that then harbor the terrorists. We see the result in Brussels as well as Paris. That is the Heinrich amendment. That is a broad characterization of it, but basically that is the thrust. The Thune-Nelson amendment is going at the perimeter security. OK, think Egypt and the Russian airliner. It was an airport employee who smuggled the bomb onto the plane, not as a passenger but as an airport employee. Think the Atlanta airport, 2 years ago. In a gunrunning scheme over 3 months, over 100 guns were transported from Atlanta to New York. The police in New York could not figure out how all of these guns were getting on the streets in New York. They kept checking the trains, and they kept checking the interstates. They could not figure it out. Here is how they did it. An employee at the Atlanta airport--because Atlanta was not checking their employees--would smuggle the guns in. Then that employee had access in the terminal to get into the sterile area--the TSA sterile area--and he would go into the men's room, meet the passenger who had already come through security and was clean, and give the guns to him to put them in his empty knapsack, his backpack. This employee, over the course of 17 times, over 3 months, smuggled over 100 guns. Thank goodness it was a criminal enterprise, not a terrorist, because you can imagine what would have happened. The Miami International Airport 10 years ago figured this out. What they did was, instead of having hundreds of entry points into the airport for airport employees in a very large airport like Atlanta, in Miami they boiled it down to a handful. There the employees went through similar security that passengers do to check to see if they had any weapons. They had a special identification card that they would have to stick into an electronic machine and put in their code, which was another way of checking to make sure that the employee was who they said they were. Miami solved the problem after having a problem with drugs 10 years ago. Interestingly, in the interim, the Orlando International Airport, likewise, about 4 years ago had a similar drug problem. They did the same thing. They boiled down hundreds of entry points for airport employees to a handful. They had those checks. I have gone to see those checks at those two airports. That is exactly how they do it. The fact is, we have 300 airports in the United States. There were only two that were doing this kind of perimeter checking. Atlanta then became the [[Page S1779]] poster boy of what can happen in a gunrunning scheme. I am happy to report to the Senate that, in fact, the Atlanta airport has now done exactly what Miami and Orlando have done. But we have 297 other airports that need to do the same thing. So the Thune-Nelson amendment is exactly getting at that kind of perimeter security situation. I highly commend both the Thune-Nelson amendment as well as the Heinrich amendment. There are a whole bunch of cosponsors--bipartisan--on each of these. I highly recommend both of these to the Senate. I hope we will vote on those today--hopefully, this morning. Now, there are going to be, of course, a series of many other amendments, some very well intentioned that have some technical glitches, and we have our very expert staff right now starting to try to work out some of these technical glitches. Then we can get moving with this FAA bill. I would mention one other amendment that this Senator will be offering, and that is on a cyber security bill. Did the Presiding Officer see the ``60 Minutes'' segment where people with a laptop could take over an automobile by going through the electronics of the automobile? They can speed it up, they can make it stop it, and they can make it turn and completely take over the operation of an automobile. Can the Presiding Officer imagine somebody being able to do that with an airliner with 250 people on board? Therefore, whether we want to face it or not, we better face it because we are in an era that what we need to do is to make sure technically that the systems in an airliner are separate, that there is an air gap, and that whatever those systems are--it might be Wi-Fi for the airplane, it might be music, or it may be whatever it is--there is an air gap so that someone cannot go into that system and suddenly get into the aircraft controls. That is super important. One other thing I would mention is what we know as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. They have become quite popular. But, obviously, one of the things that is already in the bill, which Senator Thune and I have insisted on as we approach this FAA bill, is that we have to come face-to-face with the reality that drones are now impairing the safety of an ascending or a descending aircraft. We have seen--the two of us--an operation where you can now take over the operation of a drone. Education can do so much. People have to understand that you basically have to not fly a drone within 5 miles of an airport. Just recently, at Miami International Airport, there was an inbound American Airlines plane, and there was a drone about 1,000 feet off on the left side. Remember Captain Sully Sullenberger, when a flock of geese suddenly got sucked into the engines and all power was lost. Fortunately, he had the Hudson River that he could belly it in after he had taken off from LaGuardia. You put a drone with plastic and metal, let that get sucked into the engine, and you will have a catastrophic failure. You don't want to put your passengers in that kind of operation. Therefore, education is one thing, but there is always going to be a young person that does not know about this. We don't know the answer. We know we can take over the operation of the drone, send it over here, have it set down, and have it land. The technology is there, but how do we apply that technology so we avoid this aircraft collision? There is an increasing use of drones that are so helpful for so many commercial purposes, not to mention the pure pleasure of flying a drone around, which we are seeing has become exceptionally popular. We address that in the bill by giving the appropriate direction to the FAA to start coming up with the solutions of how we are going to protect aircraft in and around airports. On down the line, there are going to be so many different issues with regard to drones, far beyond the scope of the FAA bill. On the question of privacy--a drone suddenly coming down and coming at eye level outside your bedroom window snooping--there are all kinds of questions about privacy. What about the fact that you can now put a gun on a drone? We know in a war zone we have the capability of doing that with very sophisticated weapons, such as Hellfire missiles, but now some people are experimenting with putting a gun on a drone. We have the ramifications of what that means for society to deal with in the future. For the immediate future, the FAA bill on the floor--we have this problem of avoiding drones colliding into aircraft, and that is in the bill and it is addressed. We have a lot of interesting issues to talk about. Let's get the Senate on it, and hopefully we can get agreement so we can at least vote on two of these amendments this morning. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3482, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3464 Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3482, as modified, and ask that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Heinrich] proposes an amendment numbered 3482, as modified, to amendment No. 3464. The amendment, as modified, is as follows: (Purpose: To expand and enhance visible deterrents at major transportation hubs and to increase the resources to protect and secure the United States) At the end of title V, insert the following: SEC. 5032. VISIBLE DETERRENT. Section 1303 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/ 11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1112) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (A) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a semicolon; (B) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (C) by adding at the end the following: ``(5) if the VIPR team is deployed to an airport, shall require, as appropriate based on risk, that the VIPR team conduct operations-- ``(A) in the sterile area and any other areas to which only individuals issued security credentials have unescorted access; and ``(B) in non-sterile areas.''; and (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2007 through 2011'' and inserting ``such sums as necessary, including funds to develop not more than 60 VIPR teams, for fiscal years 2016 through 2017''. SEC. 5033. LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING FOR MASS CASUALTY AND ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENTS. Section 2006(a)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 607(a)(2)) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (E) through (I) as subparagraphs (F) through (J), respectively; and (2) by inserting after subparagraph (D) the following: ``(E) training exercises to enhance preparedness for and response to mass casualty and active shooter incidents and security events at public locations, including airports and mass transit systems;''. SEC. 5034. ASSISTANCE TO AIRPORTS AND SURFACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. Section 2008(a) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609(a)) is amended-- (1) by redesigning paragraphs (9) through (13) as paragraphs (10) through (14), respectively; and (2) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following: ``(9) enhancing the security and preparedness of secure and non-secure areas of eligible airports and surface transportation systems.''. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, this amendment would strengthen U.S. airport security, especially in nonsecure or soft-target areas of airports--places such as check-in and baggage claim areas. It would also update Federal security programs to provide active shooter training for law enforcement and increase the presence of Federal agents with bomb-sniffing canines at these nonsecure areas. I thank the cosponsors of the amendment: Senator Manchin, Senator Schumer, Senator Nelson, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cantwell, Senator Carper, Senator Baldwin, Senator Durbin, Senator Bennet, and Senator Blumenthal. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the adoption of this amendment. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. [[Page S1780]] The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill and ask consent to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Pennsylvania Senator Toomey to talk about an issue we began to discuss on the floor yesterday, but we have been working many months on this issue. It is a rather simple issue, but it is a matter that has some real urgency connected to it because we are talking about a secondary barrier on airplanes--meaning a barrier other than what we know now to be a reinforced cockpit door--to prevent terrorists from getting into the cockpit. What we need to do in addition to that, after Congress mandated the installation of these reinforced cockpit doors, is add a secondary barrier. This is something that arises because we not only know from the attack on 9/11 but thereafter, we know that, No. 1, this is still an intention that terrorists have to take over an airplane. We know since 9/11, 51-- I will correct the record from yesterday, I think I said 15, I had transposed the number--but it is 51 hijacking attempts around the world since 9/11. This is not a problem that is going away, and we have to deal with it. This is the barrier we are talking about. So people understand the nature of this barrier, this is a lightweight wire mesh gate that would prevent a terrorist from getting into the cockpit or even getting to the door of the cockpit, which, as we said, is already reinforced. What it does fundamentally is block access to the flight deck. That is what we are talking about. That is what our amendment does. We know the substantial number of groups that support this. I will just read the list for the record. And this actually is support for the underlying bill that Senator Toomey and I and others have been working on for a while. The underlying bill itself was S. 911. Also, the amendment, amendment No. 3458, is endorsed by the following groups: the Airline Pilots Association, the Allied Pilots Association, the Association of Flight Attendants, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the US Airline Pilots Association, the Coalition of Airline Pilots Association, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, and Families of September 11. There have been numerous studies done. I am holding a study--although you can't see it from a distance--which was conducted by the Cato Institute, among others, on terrorism risk and cost-benefit analysis of aviation security. So we not only have substantial support from virtually every group you could point toward, but we have some expertise on how to protect pilots in the cockpit, how to protect passengers on an airplane, and, of course, how to do that by preventing terrorists from getting through or near the cockpit because of a good secondary barrier. This effort started literally from folks we now know in Pennsylvania. It started with, among other people, the Saracini family, Ellen Saracini, the wife of Captain Victor Saracini, who piloted United Flight 175, which terrorists hijacked and flew into the World Trade Center on 9/11. So in memory of Captain Saracini and inspired by the great work of his wife Ellen Saracini, we offer this amendment. Again, I am very pleased to be working on this with my colleague Senator Toomey, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to underscore the points made by my colleague Senator Casey. I thank him for his leadership. This is a very simple matter that is very straightforward and common sense. We know there is a very real vulnerability in our commercial aircraft. We know this. There is no mystery here. And we have a very simple, affordable, reasonable solution that will provide the security we need. After September 11, 2001, Congress very rightly mandated that the cockpit door be reinforced so that it is virtually impossible to destroy that door, to knock down that door, to defeat the purpose of that door when it is closed and latched. The problem is that when it is open--which it must be open periodically during many flights--a very strong door is useless. We know what happens now on airlines because we have all witnessed it, right? When a pilot needs to come out or go in or there is access to the cockpit when that door is open, the flight attendant rolls a little serving cart in front of the door. I suppose that is better than nothing, but it is not much better than nothing. That cart can be rolled away. We are not the only ones who have observed this. An FAA advisory has observed this risk. The 9/11 Commission pointed out that the terrorists were very focused on the opportunity created by the opening of the cockpit door. As Senator Casey pointed out, there have been multiple attempts to breach that door. Several have been successful. We have an amendment that solves this problem in a very affordable, reasonable, sensible way. It is a lightweight, collapsible barrier made of wire mesh, and a flight attendant can simply draw it across the opening, lock it, and then at that point the cockpit door can be opened and there is no way someone would be able to rush through that wire mesh in time to get to the cockpit during that moment when the door is open. That is what our amendment does. It passed the Transportation Committee in the House unanimously. As Senator Casey pointed out, it has very broad support from many of the stakeholders who care about the security of our commercial aviation. It is our hope and understanding that we will be very soon propounding a unanimous consent agreement which will allow this amendment to be pending and that this will be one of the amendments which will be on the docket for a subsequent vote. I hope we will get to that momentarily. I hope we will get that locked in, and then I would urge my colleagues to vote yes on our amendment and enhance commercial aviation safety. I yield the floor. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important matter before the Senate, the reauthorization of our Nation's Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA is tasked with a critical mission to manage the safety and the security of our Nation's airspace. Our Nation's airspace is an incredible resource that fuels our economy. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in 2015, a record 896 million passengers traversed America's skies. Our aviation system contributes $1.5 trillion to our Nation's economy and it supports 11.8 million jobs for hard-working Americans, as noted by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The Senate's FAA reauthorization bill will make our aviation system stronger for families, children, veterans, and the traveling public. It will also benefit Nebraska's rural airports and local aviation stakeholders. Notably, this carefully negotiated bill will strengthen America's aviation system without raising fees or taxes on airline passengers. Our robust, bipartisan legislation includes several major priorities I championed. I am proud of bipartisan language I worked to include in the bill, along with Senators Booker, Cantwell, and Ayotte. Our provision would compel the FAA to work with the airline industry to comprehensively assess and update guidelines for emergency medical kits on commercial aircraft. These kits, which haven't been statutorily updated since 1998, provide lifesaving resources for passengers. It is well past time for the FAA to evaluate medications and equipment included in these kits. Doing so will ensure all passengers, [[Page S1781]] particularly families with young infants facing unknown allergic reactions, have access to the medical supplies they might need in an emergency situation. In addition, I worked with Senator McCaskill to include an amendment that would make it easier for traveling mothers to care for their young infants. Our amendment unanimously passed the Commerce Committee. We worked closely with airport stakeholders, including Omaha's Eppley Airfield, to establish reasonable minimum standards for both medium- and large-hub airports to develop private rooms for nursing mothers in future capital development plans. Traveling as a new mom can be challenging and it can be stressful at times, but I believe this important change will provide increased flexibility and also peace of mind for mothers traveling through airports across our country. I also joined Senator Hirono to include an amendment that would ensure disabled veterans working at the FAA have access to service- connected disability leave. The FAA was one of the few agencies not included in the recently passed Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act. That bill required Federal agencies to ensure disabled vets have access to service-connected disability leave. Our disabled veterans bravely served our country, and they deserve access to benefits they have earned. I am grateful for the achievements this bill will advance for the flying public. At the same time, the bill is also a victory for Nebraska's rural communities and airports. The Small Airport Regulation Relief Act, which is included in the FAA bill, would create a temporary exemption for small airports so they can continue to receive airport improvement program funds--those AIP funds--despite downturns in air service. The survival of smaller airports, such as Scottsbluff's Western Nebraska Regional Airport, depends on these crucial funds to provide service to local passengers and businesses. Several of Nebraska's small and community airports, such as Alliance, Chadron, Grand Island, McCook, North Platte, and Scottsbluff, will also benefit from a continuation of the Essential Air Service, or EAS, Program. The EAS Program incentivizes air carriers to provide service to underserved and rural areas, and it is critical to ensuring air service continues for Nebraska's rural communities. Meanwhile, the Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island is growing and hosts a privately operated Federal contract tower. I encouraged the inclusion of provisions to compel the FAA to complete a pending cost-benefit analysis for Federal contract tower airports. This analysis would reflect the cost-share arrangement more accurately between our local airports and the FAA for those contract towers. Through this legislation, we can help to reduce the burden on local airports such as Grand Island, NE. One of the major challenges facing aviation manufacturers has been the FAA's inconsistent and often unclear regulatory process. I collaborated with Duncan Aviation of Lincoln, NE, the largest family- owned maintenance, repair, and overhaul organization in the world, to address this challenge. In fact, Chairman Thune toured the facilities at Duncan Aviation with me in Lincoln last fall. Our bill would provide clarity to aviation businesses like Duncan Aviation by compelling the FAA to establish a centralized safety guidance database. Moreover, the bill would require the FAA to establish a Regulatory Consistency Communications Board. The Board would set standards to ensure the consistent application of regulations and guidance at regional offices throughout our country. Agricultural aviators in Nebraska will also benefit from safety enhancements in this bill. Far too many of our agricultural pilots have died in recent years after collisions with unmarked utility towers. This legislation would ensure that towers are marked to create safer skies for our agriculture pilots. Passing our FAA bill will be a major accomplishment for the Senate. I appreciate and commend the hard work of Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and their committee staffers on this meaningful FAA reauthorization bill. In the coming days, I look forward to working together to help pass this critical legislation that will benefit the flying public, our national aviation system, and Nebraska's rural airports and aviation stakeholders. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment numbered 3512 be modified with the changes at the desk and that at 12:05 p.m. today the Senate vote on the following amendments in the order listed: Thune No. 3512, as modified; and Heinrich No. 3482, as modified; further that at 1:45 p.m. today the Senate vote on the Schumer amendment No. 3483 and that no second-degree amendments be in order to any of the amendments prior to the vote and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 3512), as modified, is as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE ___--TRANSPORTATION SECURITY AND TERRORISM PREVENTION Subtitle A--Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act SEC. _101. SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act''. SEC. _102. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) A number of recent airport security breaches in the United States have involved the use of Secure Identification Display Area (referred to in this section as ``SIDA'') badges, the credentials used by airport and airline workers to access the secure areas of an airport. (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged with using his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a number of months via commercial aircraft. (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation Safety Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and transport a firearm in his carry-on luggage. (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation found that over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport were lost or missing. (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, Transportation Security Administration contractors were indicted for participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed through the secure area of the San Francisco International Airport. (6) The Administration has indicated that it does not maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead relies on airport operators to track airport worker credentials. (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain threshold of missing SIDA badges. (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access control. (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security reported that the Administration did not have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers who had records in United States intelligence-related databases because the Administration was not authorized to receive all terrorism-related information under current interagency watchlisting policy. (10) The Inspector General also found that the Administration did not have appropriate checks in place to reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment investigations, including criminal history record checks and work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight over the airport operators that the Administration relies on to perform criminal history and work authorization checks for airport workers. (11) There is growing concern about the potential insider threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities. SEC. _103. DEFINITIONS.

Amendment No. 3512, as Modified Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might just speak to amendment No. 3512, which we will be voting on momentarily, I know Senator Nelson has already spoken on this issue. We worked very hard on a series of security bills that we could bring to the floor. We are trying to move them separately, but I think they fit nicely into the debate we are having on the FAA reauthorization. Senators Nelson, Ayotte, Cantwell, and I have been leading oversight of airport and airline workers abusing their secure area access badges. This oversight led our committee to approve bipartisan legislation--S. 2361, Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act--to tighten the vetting of airport workers with ties to terrorists and serious criminal behavior that should disqualify them from accessing sensitive airport areas. Just in the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers have been caught in the act of helping criminal organizations. On March 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine after being confronted by transportation security officers in California. On March 26 in Florida, an airline gate agent was arrested with a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an associate. As we work to address the threat of an aviation insider helping terrorists, [[Page S1786]] criminals who break laws for financial gain and those with a history of violence are a really good place to start. It is high time that we start cracking down on these types of offenses for people who are working in sensitive areas of our airports. U.S. terrorism experts believe that ISIS is recruiting criminals to join its ranks in Europe, and some of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in Brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals. Ensuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that experts believe an ISIS affiliate may have planted a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight leaving Egypt with the help of an airport employee, which killed 224 people on board. The recent attacks by ISIS in the unsecured area of the Brussels Airport also underscore the vulnerability of airport areas outside of TSA security screening checkpoints. The House of Representatives and the Commerce Committee also approved legislation--H.R. 2843, the PreCheck Expansion Act--in December of 2015 to expand the PreCheck program by developing private sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. These private sector partners would be required to use an assessment equivalent to a fingerprint-based criminal history record check conducted through the FBI. These changes would increase the number of passengers who are vetted before they get to the airport. As a result, more passengers would receive expedited airport screening and get through security checkpoints more quickly, ensuring they don't pose the kind of easy target that the ISIS suicide bombers exploited at the Brussels Airport. In addition to the bills approved by our committee on March 23, the House Homeland Security Committee approved H.R. 4698, the SAFE GATES Act of 2016, which would strengthen security at international airports with direct flights to the United States. Specifically, the bill would require TSA to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of all last- point-of-departure airports, a security coordination enhancement plan, and a workforce assessment. It would authorize the TSA to donate security screening equipment to foreign last-point-of-departure airports and to evaluate foreign countries' air cargo security programs to prevent any shipment of nefarious materials via air cargo. I believe these bills will help make air travel more secure, and they should advance in the full Senate in this amendment to the FAA bill. I encourage my colleagues to support the Thune-Nelson amendment and then also follow-on with the Heinrich amendment, which will come up shortly after a vote on that amendment. I think the Heinrich amendment also makes a number of important security improvements that will also strengthen airport security. There has been a discussion about whether there ought to be more VIPR teams. I think there are 30 or so at this point, and the amendment would allow that number to go up to 60. Yesterday we had the opportunity to question the TSA Administrator, Admiral Neffenger, about whether additional VIPR teams would be useful. He said they could put to use anything they were given in terms of additional units that might be deployed to places around the country where they think there is a need. So that is the principal component of the Heinrich amendment, which also addresses some of the security issues. I don't think we can understate how important security is in light of everything that is going on in the world today. We have people who want to harm Americans, and it is our job to make sure we are giving those authorities who are there to prevent those types of attacks against Americans all the tools they need in order to do their jobs effectively. I encourage our colleagues here in the Senate--when we have an opportunity to vote here momentarily on both of these security amendments--to support those amendments. They improve and strengthen security at our airports around this country, and I think they fit nicely within the context of the FAA reauthorization bill and the debate we are currently having on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida. Amendment No. 3483 to Amendment No. 3464 Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up Schumer amendment No. 3483 and ask that the Schumer and Bennet amendments be Nelson for Schumer and Bennet. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 3483 to amendment No. 3464. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To require the Federal Aviation Administration to establish minimum standards for space for passengers on passenger aircraft) At the end of subtitle A of title III, add the following: SEC. 3124. REGULATIONS RELATING TO SPACE FOR PASSENGERS ON AIRCRAFT. (a) Moratorium on Reductions to Aircraft Seat Size.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prohibit any air carrier from reducing the size, width, padding, or pitch of seats on passenger aircraft operated by the air carrier, the amount of leg room per seat on such aircraft, or the width of aisles on such aircraft. (b) Regulations Relating to Space for Passengers on Aircraft.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall prescribe regulations-- (1) establishing minimum standards for space for passengers on passenger aircraft, including the size, width, padding, and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room per seat, and the width of aisles on such aircraft for the safety, health, and comfort of passengers; and (2) requiring each air carrier to prominently display on the website of the air carrier the amount of space available for each passenger on passenger aircraft operated by the air carrier, including the size, width, padding, and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room per seat, and the width of aisles on such aircraft. (c) Consultations.--In prescribing the regulations required by subsection (b), the Administrator shall consult with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, passenger advocacy organizations, physicians, and ergonomic engineers. (d) Air Carrier Defined.--In this section, the term ``air carrier'' means an air carrier (as defined in section 40102 of title 49, United States Code) that transports passengers by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in just 5 minutes we will have our first series of votes on amendments on this bill. This is a good start to the FAA bill. It is improving the underlying bill that has a lot of attention to security already in it. But these are clearly amendments that will improve the bill. I spoke about it earlier today. I certainly commend these amendments to the Senate. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Vote on Amendment No. 3512, as modified. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3512, as modified, offered by the Senator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I yield back whatever time remains. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Further, if present and voting the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) would have voted ``yea.'' [[Page S1787]] Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Amendment No. 3482, as Modified The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3482, as modified, offered by the Senator from New Mexico. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, airports, bus depots, and train stations are things that we all rely on every day to have the freedom of movement we enjoy in this country. In the wake of the recent terror attacks in the Brussels Airport and Metro, Americans are worried about their security, and they want to feel safe when traveling with their loved ones. While we relentlessly target terrorists overseas, we must also do all we can to intelligently protect Americans here at home. My amendment would increase the number of TSA VIPR teams, who provide a visible deterrent to terrorist threats in high-priority locations. These teams are recognizable as they often have bomb-sniffing canines. My amendment would also provide active shooter training for law enforcement and strengthen security in nonsecure so-called soft-target areas, such as check-in and baggage claim areas. By employing these additional commonsense safeguards, we will intelligently respond to these threats. Most importantly, by preserving our freedom to go about our daily lives, we will ensure that the terrorists have failed to change how we live and who we are. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the Heinrich amendment. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3482, as modified. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. Iranian Access to U.S. Financial System Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, when Obama administration officials sold the President's nuclear deal last summer to the American people, they were clearly sensitive to charges that they gave too much away. They knew that giving Iran $100 billion that we could never get back in exchange for a mere temporary deal that expired in 10 to 15 years would be viewed with deep skepticism. They knew that an inspection system that gives the ayatollahs a 24- day heads-up before an inspection would not pass the laugh test. They knew that granting the ayatollahs massive sanctions relief while still allowing them to develop an industrial-scale nuclear enrichment program would invite accusations that the President was, to put it frankly, swindled. So in their sales pitch, these administration officials sought to blunt these expected criticisms. They repeatedly stated that the United States would maintain certain tough sanctions, even after the deal became effective. They said the United States would hold the line on measures that punish and suppress Iran's nonnuclear malign activities. They emphatically stated that in no way would the U.S. economy be allowed to bolster an Iranian economy that is significantly controlled by the Iranian regime, tainted by illicit financing of terrorism, and used by the ayatollahs to fund domestic oppression and international aggression--including blowing up hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq with roadside bombs. In particular, these administration officials were emphatic that the United States would never, ever, ever grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system and U.S. dollars to facilitate Iran's trade in oil and other goods. For instance, when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew stated: Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with U.S. banks. Iran, in other words, will continue to be denied access to the world's largest financial and commercial market. Likewise, Adam Szubin, the Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, echoed that sentiment and was even more precise. In September he stated: Iran will not be able to open bank accounts with U.S. banks, nor will Iran be able to access the U.S. banking sector, even for that momentary transaction to, what we call, dollarize a foreign payment. . . . That is not in the cards. That is not part of the relief offered under the JCPOA. So, the U.S. sanctions on Iran, which, of course, had their origins long before Iran had a nuclear program, will remain in place. [[Page S1788]] It is difficult to overstate the importance of these statements uttered just a few months ago. The U.S. dollar is the standard currency in which international trade is conducted. Because the ayatollahs can't deal in dollars, they haven't fully opened their economy to the world-- thankfully. In addition, the U.S. financial system hasn't yet been tainted by Iran's terror financing, its international aggression, and its crackdown on domestic democratic dissent. But now, a mere 7 months into a 15-year agreement, the Obama administration is shedding the resolve its officials tried to so hard to display before Congress. According to numerous reports, the administration intends to backtrack on the statements of Secretary Lew and Adam Szubin. It is looking for some way, somehow to give Iran access to U.S. dollars to boost Iranian trade and investment. I want to be very clear. If the President moves to grant Iran access to the U.S. dollar--whether directly or indirectly--there will be consequences. If there is any statement, guidance, regulation, or Executive action that opens the U.S. banking sector to Iran even a crack, the Senate will hold hearings with each official who assured the American people last summer that the ayatollahs would never access the dollar. We will explore whether they lied back then or whether they intend to resign in protest now. If this policy change moves forward, I will dedicate myself to working with my colleagues to pass legislation blocking the change. If the Obama administration proceeds with this massive concession to the ayatollahs, every Member of the Senate who voted to accept the Iranian deal will have to go home and explain why the U.S. economy is now complicit in Iran's financing of terrorist attacks against Americans and American allies. That the Obama administration would even consider allowing Iran access to the U.S. banking sector is extremely disconcerting, but it is not surprising. It follows a steady pattern that has become increasingly clear since the conclusion of the nuclear deal. Time and again, Iran provokes the United States, commits brazen acts to destabilize its neighbors, and threatens to undo the Iran deal. In response, the United States rushes to grant the ayatollahs more concessions in order to placate them. Iran has tested ballistic missiles, captured U.S. sailors, and fueled conflicts in Syria and Yemen with fresh arms and troops--all while employing ``Death to America'' as a rallying cry. But in the face of Iran's continued aggression, the President has displayed only weakness. Instead of steeling himself for a fight with the ayatollahs, he has laid down and rolled over for them. He has repeatedly refused to designate Iran's tests of ballistic missiles as the violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions they so clearly are. The President also agreed to send an additional $1.7 billion to the ayatollahs, ostensibly to settle outstanding claims. For good measure, that $1.7 billion includes $1.3 billion in gratuitous interest payments. The President granted clemency to seven convicted Iranian criminals and dismissed arrest warrants for 14 Iranian fugitives who faced charges for sanctions violations. Now the President may be on the verge of granting the largest concession yet--dollarizing Iran's international trade and declaring Iran truly open for business. We should call this for what it is--concession creep. In the same manner that no Member of the Senate should trust Iran to abide by its commitments made in the Iranian nuclear deal, we can no longer trust the administration to hold fast to the specific concessions contained in the four corners of that deal. The ink is hardly dry on the deal, and the President has already shown himself all too susceptible to the temptations of appeasement. The ayatollahs reportedly have complained to U.S. officials that it is too hard to transact business without access to U.S. dollars. The answer to that should be ``too bad.'' It should not be easy for the world's worst sponsor of terrorism to do business with the global economy. It should not be easy for industries dominated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to trade in financial markets. International business leaders, directors, CEOs, and general counsels should not rush into Iran for fear of the grave reputational, financial, political, and legal consequences of doing business with this outlaw regime. The Iranians know the Obama administration is desperate to preserve the nuclear deal. They hold the possibility of walking away from the agreement as a sword of Damocles over the President's head in order to extract concession after concession. They lord it over him in order to forestall any U.S. action that would meaningfully stop their regional aggression and campaign of terror. So intense is President Obama's fear that the Ayatollah will rip up the nuclear agreement, he has completely upended U.S. strategy in the Middle East to the point where adversaries are allies and allies are becoming adversaries. This parade of concessions must stop, and it must stop now. The administration must fully implement all new sanctions passed by Congress to punish Iran's development of ballistic missiles, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its human rights abuses. It must work with our traditional allies in the Middle East to neutralize Iran's attempt to foment instability throughout the region. The President should issue a very clear order that Iran will not be granted any direct or indirect access to the U.S. banking system and the dollar. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. (The remarks of Mr. Merkley pertaining to the introduction of S. 2760 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Amendment No. 3490 to Amendment No. 3464 Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3490. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] proposes an amendment numbered 3490 to amendment No. 3464. Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To extend protections against physical assault to air carrier customer service representatives) Strike section 5009 and insert the following: SEC. 5009. INTERFERENCE WITH AIR CARRIER EMPLOYEES. (a) In General.--Section 46503 is amended by inserting after ``to perform those duties'' the following ``, or who assaults an air carrier customer representative in an airport, including a gate or ticket agent, who is performing the duties of the representative or agent,''. (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 46503 is amended in the section heading by inserting ``or air carrier customer representatives'' after ``screening personnel''. (c) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for chapter 465 is amended by striking the item relating to section 46503 and inserting the following: ``46503. Interference with security screening personnel or air carrier customer representatives.''. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up this amendment and offer it because the issue is making sure that those who work in the air transportation system are safe and secure. This is an important issue to the men and women who work at Sea-Tac and at other airports and are part of the delivery system of making sure air transportation is safe. They are an integral part of air transportation at every airport in the United States of America. This issue is something that has been considered in the House of Representatives as part of the transportation package as well, and it is part of what we think should be in this package in the Senate; that is, making sure that those who are part of the delivery system--ticket counter agents, agents who are aiding and assisting in getting passengers through the terminals and onto planes at the gate, assisting, as many of the challenging days go by, in delivering good air transportation service. What has happened is that these individuals have become victims--the victims of physical, violent abuse; that is, the public has taken to bodily harm against these individuals. So this amendment puts in similar safeguards [[Page S1789]] that are in line with other transportation officials who are protected from this kind of physical abuse. I will have more to say on it, but I know my colleague is trying to get to the floor to speak as well. I will put into the Record examples of individuals who are ticketing agents, baggage agents, air transportation delivery system workers who have been hurt, and they deserve to have protection. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3483 Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge a ``yes'' vote on the upcoming amendment to require the FAA to set a minimum standard seat size. This amendment would ensure that airlines can't keep chopping down on seat size and legroom until consumers are packed in like sardines in a can on every flight. Over the last few decades, between the size of the seat and the distance between the seats, the flying public has lost half a foot of their space. Flying is not pleasant anymore. You are crammed in. I am not that tall--a little under 6-foot-1. What I do when I fly is I take out the magazine and the air-sickness bag and the little folder that shows you where the exits are to gain one-sixteenth of an inch more legroom. Moms with kids have a lot of trouble in those very narrow seats. Have you ever been in the situation where you are in the middle and there are two sort of large people on either side of you? It is not the most pleasant flying experience. We don't have too much competition anymore. We have very few airlines. This is a place where the public is clamoring for change. When I said I was going to offer this amendment, I got more feedback on it than most other things. And you don't have to be 6-foot-4 to understand the problem. You would think that by cramming in more and more passengers on each flight, the airlines could lower their prices. Instead, several major airlines went in the other direction: They started charging for the extra inches and legroom that were once considered standard. So it practically costs you an arm and a leg just to have space for your arms and legs. At a time when airlines are making record profits, at a time when fuel costs are extremely low, we need this amendment to protect consumers' safety and comfort. This amendment would do three things. It doesn't set a standard seat size; it freezes the current seat size in place so they can't shrink it any further. It directs the FAA to set minimum standard seat size and pitch for all commercial flights. And some of this involves comfort, but some of it involves safety. God forbid there is something terrible happening on a plane--the seats are so narrow, it is harder for people to get out. Finally, we focus on transparency. We require airlines to post their seat sizes on their Web sites, providing at least a commercial incentive for airlines to offer more comfortable seat arrangements. Most folks travel under the expectation that the airlines are going to set the guidelines and that is that; there is nothing they can do about it. We actually had to put in the underlying bill that airlines should refund bag fees charged to consumers if the airline lost their bags. And I would say to my good friends on the other side, if we can mandate that bag fees be returned--not leave it up to the free market-- we can mandate that the FAA at least set a proper seat size. They can't say: Well, leave it up to the free market on one but not on the other. It is not a little fair. Now we see why we need these amendments. The bag fee--and I agree that if they lose your bags or delay your bags, they shouldn't keep the extra bag fee. It should be refunded. In most industries, that would be a standard practice. If you fail to deliver a service somebody paid for, they should get their money back. But sometimes in the airline industry you have to require basic courtesy. In conclusion, the great Abraham Lincoln was once asked how long a man's legs should be, and he famously answered: Long enough to reach from the body to the ground. If you asked a major airline today how long a man's legs should be, they would say: Short enough to miss the tray table. That is no way to fly. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and move this bill in a more consumer-friendly direction. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have to catch planes, and it takes extra time for them to squeeze into those small seats with no legroom. So I yield back my time, and I ask unanimous consent that we move the vote up to right now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3483. Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) would have voted ``nay.'' Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 42, nays 54, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 43 Leg.] YEAS--42 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Casey Collins Coons Donnelly Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Reid Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--54 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Carper Cassidy Coats Cochran Corker Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NOT VOTING--4 Cornyn Cruz Durbin Sanders The amendment (No. 3483) was rejected. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass the legislation we passed here in the Senate a few weeks ago called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. We passed it on March 10, which was 27 days ago--almost a month. It is estimated that we lose about 120 Americans every day to drug overdoses. That means that during that time period--those 27 days--we lost about 3,240 additional Americans who we represent to substance abuse and death from heroin and prescription drug overdoses. Since 2007, drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than any other cause of accidental death, even surpassing car accidents. It is probably [[Page S1790]] true nationally now as well. Addiction is treatable, but 9 out of 10 people who need treatment aren't getting it. That is a tragedy. It shows that the system we have right now just isn't working, and that is what our legislation addresses, among other things. In one 5-day span since we passed CARA, just in the last month, we had five people die from heroin and Fentanyl overdoses in one of the cities I represent-- Cleveland, OH. I was in Athens, OH, more than 2 weeks after we passed CARA, and received a tour of the Rural Women's Addiction Recovery Bassett House facility. Dr. Joe Gay and Ruth Tarter took me around so I could meet some of the brave women who stepped forward to treat their addiction issues. Some of them were there with their kids. They have an amazing success rate. I will tell you that 3 days after I left Athens, OH, $40,000 of heroin was seized at a traffic stop very close to this treatment facility. It is everywhere. It knows no ZIP code. It is in rural areas, suburban areas, and inner cities. States are starting to take action. Ohio is taking action, your States are taking action, and communities are taking action. Local leaders know this is a problem, but they want the Federal Government to be a better partner. That is what CARA provides. It provides best practices from around the country. It provides more funding for some critical elements that are evidence- based--based on research and what actually works. Our States and local communities are desperate for this right now. By the way, this legislation is not just bipartisan. It is also bicameral. In other words, not only have Republicans and Democrats worked across the aisle here in the Senate over the last 3 years putting this bill together, but our colleagues in the House have worked together as well. I am encouraged by the fact that the CARA legislation in the House has 113 cosponsors. It is bipartisan. It is based on good evidence. It is based on a lot of work and effort. Today I heard through a media account that one of the House leaders said there is interest in moving something even this month. That is great. But he also talked about hearings and markups and so on. Let's be sure the hearings and markups don't delay what we know we should do, which is to pass the CARA legislation. It has been bicameral and bipartisan. It passed the Senate with a 94-to-1 vote. That never happens around here-- 94 to 1. This is legislation which we know will make a difference right now in our communities that are dealing with a crisis we all face. Let's move this legislation. I say to my friends in the House with all due respect, this legislation has been carefully crafted and we have done the hard work. I mentioned that we spent 3 years of factfinding on this bill. We didn't think we had all the right answers, so we went out to experts all over the country. We took time to listen. We consulted with them. We listened to experts, doctors, law enforcement, and patients in recovery. We listened to the drug experts in the Obama administration, such as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP. They have been very helpful. We brought in people from Health and Human Services and listened to them. We brought in people from my home State of Ohio and other States around the country. We heard from family members, many of whom have channelled their grief at losing a loved one into advocacy for the CARA legislation because they know it is going to help. One testified in the Judiciary Committee when we marked up the legislation. Tonda DaRe from Carrollton, OH, talked about having lost her daughter, who was a very successful high school student and engaged to be married. Everything was going great. When she turned 21, she made a mistake: She tried heroin. She went into recovery. She relapsed. She ended up dying of an overdose. Unfortunately, this is a story that is retold all over our country. There are moms, there are dads, there are aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters who come forward to tell us these tragic stories about losing a loved one. They want this legislation to pass because they know it is going to help another family member or a friend or a coworker or someone whom they have never met but whom they want to help so they don't have to go through the grief they have gone through. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse--a Democrat--and I have worked on this legislation together, along with many other people in this Chamber. We have also worked, as I said, with many on the House side. We worked with folks on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol because this has become an issue that affects us all. It is a nonpartisan issue. We have to move it forward. We held five forums here in Washington, DC, and brought in experts to get counsel and advice. They helped us develop a legislative proposal that was thoughtful because it actually addressed the real problem. In April 2014, we had a forum on the criminal justice system which included alternatives to incarceration, and you will see that in our legislation. The notion is, for users who get arrested for possession, let's not just throw them in jail because that hasn't worked. Let's get them into treatment and get them into a recovery program that works. In July 2014, we held a forum on how women are impacted by this drug epidemic, looking particularly at addiction and treatment responses. Some new data that is out there now shows that most of the people who are suffering from heroin and prescription drug addiction are women. In December 2014, we held a forum on the science of addiction--how we could get at this from a medical point of view, how we could come up with better medical approaches to this to be able to stop the craving, to deal with the addiction problem, to get people through withdrawal. We also talked about how to address some of the collateral consequences of addiction. In April of 2015, we held a forum on our youth and how we can better promote drug prevention. After all, keeping people from getting into the funnel of addiction in the first place has to be a priority. To help people avoid going down that funnel of addiction, we need better prevention, better education. That is part of our legislation. We also had input about what is working in recovery and what is not working in recovery. We held a forum in July of 2015 to talk about our veterans, to talk about the very sad situation with veterans who are coming back to our shores who have PTSD--post-traumatic stress disorder--and who have brain injuries. Some recent data shows that about 20 percent of returning veterans with those issues are becoming addicted to prescription drugs or heroin; therefore, veterans courts are a major part of our legislation. These are drug courts that are focused on mental health and addiction specifically for our veterans. I have seen them in Ohio. They are working great. It is unbelievable. I talked to a guy who has been in and out of the system his whole life. He is about 45 years old now. He finally found this court that was going to help him--took him out of jail and got him into treatment. Hanging over his head was the possibility of incarceration if he didn't do the right thing and stay clean. He is now a senior at Ohio State University and is about to get his degree, and he reunited with his family for the first time in many years. He is clean. It can work. The final result was the legislative text that reflected this open and deliberative process I am talking about. This bill--just like the research it supports--is evidence-based. We didn't ask who had the idea; we just asked whether it was a good idea. It is no wonder that CARA now has support from 130 national groups, from the Fraternal Order of Police, to stakeholders in public health-- doctors and nurses, those in recovery, experts in the field, people who actually know what is going on because they are in the trenches working on this. They want this bill passed. They know it will help them and help them now. As I said, that vote was 94 to 1, which means 94 Senators say this bill is ready to go. These are Senators from every State in the Union who support this legislation, therefore representing every congressional district in the United States of America. It makes sense. It expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent opiate abuse, the use of heroin and prescription drugs. It increases drug-disposal sites to get medications out of people's hands and get it into the right hands. It takes [[Page S1791]] this medication off the bathroom shelves. It has a drug-monitoring program to get at the overprescribing issue. So many people who are currently addicted to heroin started with prescription drugs. In fact, the majority did. There is different data out there, but it is very clear that prescription drugs are a huge part of heroin addiction. It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and meth. Law enforcement has an important role to play here. It expands training and the availability of naloxone, or Narcan, to law enforcement. This is for our firefighters. When you go to a firehouse in your State--for those listening in the House, in your district--ask them: Are you going on more fire runs or are you going on more runs to help people with overdoses? They will tell you what they tell me: overdoses. That is what it has come to. That is happening in your fire department in your community. By the way, to tell you how much this law can make a difference-- because we do help get the training for them to be able to use Narcan and get the Narcan or naloxone into the right hands--Ohio public safety officials have administered naloxone over 16,000 times since 2015-- 16,000 overdoses that might otherwise have resulted in death. For the most part, this miracle drug works. First responders know how important it is. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police supports this bill. They want to equip their officers, but so do the firefighters. CARA also supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. To avoid people getting into addiction in the first place, it also creates a national task force on recovery because there is a lot of information out there we need to bring together to find out what works and what doesn't work precisely in terms of dealing with the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. CARA expands treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies who suffer from what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. What does that mean? That means babies who are born addicted. In Ohio, tragically, we had a 750-percent increase in the number of babies born with addiction in the last 12 years. I have been to the hospitals. I have been to St. Rita's in Lima. I have been to Rainbow Babies in Cleveland. I have been to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. I have seen these babies. These are tiny babies who are addicted, and they have to be taken through withdrawal. The compassionate nurses and doctors who are doing it--God bless them--I asked them: What is going to happen to these babies? They told me: Rob, we don't know. We don't know the long-term consequences because it is so new. But it is dramatic and it is happening in all of your hospitals. These neonatal units are now taking on a whole other task, which is helping babies through withdrawal. I visited folks who are not only pregnant but are addicted, and I talked to them about what they are going through and what the consequences are going to be, and it is sad. Many say: Rob, the grip of addiction is so great. I am now in treatment, but I worry about what is going to happen to my baby. We also expand treatment for expectant and postpartum women for that reason. And these expectant and postpartum women who need this help can make the right decision with more help from us. It expands residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction. It creates a pilot program to provide family-based services to women who are addicted to opiates. CARA also helps veterans, as I said. It allows those veterans to get into a veterans court, where they can get help to walk through how they get out of this addiction, how they get into recovery. They can get support from other veterans around them to provide the kind of help they need to get out of this cycle of incarceration and addiction. What do we say to the 40 million Americans who are struggling with addiction when they ask ``Why don't you guys act?'' The Senate acted 94 to 1. Why can't we get this done? It is time to move. They shouldn't have to wait. We shouldn't have to wait. To those 40 million who struggle, to those who think they can't overcome this addiction, to those who believe there is no one out there to help them, the message is, you are not alone. There is hope. You can beat this. I have seen it. There are people who care and want to help. There are so many heartbreaking stories of addiction, but there are also so many stories of hope. I think about Vanessa Perkins from Nelsonville, OH. Vanessa became addicted to heroin. Once she became addicted, she also became a victim of sex trafficking. Those two are related. In Ohio, they tell me that most sex trafficking has now to do with heroin addiction. In other words, the trafficker gets these women--usually women--addicted to heroin, and that is one way they become dependent on their trafficker. What Vanessa tells me is that it took her a long time to turn her life around, but she was courageous and brave enough to seek treatment, and she is now back on track. For the last 6 years she has been helping others, taking her experience and using it to help others deal with their addiction. She is on the board of a group called Freedom a la Cart, which is a company in Columbus, OH, that I visited last month that provides job opportunities for trafficking victims. They do a heck of a job and teach these women a trade, too--culinary arts. Now so many of these women who had been trafficked, who had been heroin addicts, are back on their feet, reunited with their families, and know the dignity and self-respect that come from the work they are doing and from helping others. There is hope. Treatment can work. Mr. President, leaders in the House say they want to move anti-heroin legislation through regular order. Again, I heard today that one of the leaders said they are planning to take action. I had conversations with Speaker Ryan on this issue. I had conversations with other leaders in the House on it. I take them at their word. I am hopeful we will see the House begin to act next week when that Chamber returns, but I will say this: The House must act, and they must act soon. I am not going to be patient on this. This is urgent, and people's lives are at stake. The House must pass this bill so the President can sign it and so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives of the people we represent. This is our responsibility. We need to take advantage of this opportunity that the Senate has given us by this huge vote--94 to 1--to get this legislation to the President and get it enacted into law. Mr. President, I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. FLINT, MICHIGAN, WATER CRISIS Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I would like to speak about two different subjects. Both are connected in the sense that they involve lack of action and people counting on us to act as a Senate. The first involves the fact that today in the city of Flint, MI, we still have people who can't drink the water coming out of the tap. I think any one of us would have trouble if that happened for 1 day, but we are talking about months and months--going on 2 years now--that we have seen a system completely broken down because of decisions, because of lack of treating the water, a whole range of things. From my perspective, the most important thing is the fact that people still don't have access to clean, safe water. They can't bathe their babies. They can't take a shower themselves. I can't imagine what it must be like for families in Flint who are waiting and waiting for help. I want to thank President Obama for doing what he can do through the administration to help from the standpoint of health and nutrition and education, but the fundamental problem is replacing the damaged pipes. As my colleagues know, we have been working very hard and we have developed a bipartisan proposal. I wish to thank the chair and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell, for working with us, and so many colleagues who are now bipartisan cosponsors on a bill with myself and Senator Peters. I wish to thank Senator Inhofe as chair of EPW and ranking member Senator Boxer and so many people who have [[Page S1792]] come together to support this effort, not only for Flint, but we now are seeing headlines across the country about other areas where lead poisoning in water is a serious issue and where we have all kinds of communities with water infrastructure needs. We have put together a proposal. We have a bipartisan proposal. We are ready to move forward. We need a vote on this proposal. As people in this building know, the junior Senator from Utah is holding us up from being able to get that vote. We have spent weeks now--weeks-- trying to find a way to get beyond this objection. We thought we had an agreement, and then the bar just keeps changing. This is not a game. These are real people, and we are trying to solve a real problem. We have put forward a proposal fully paid for that actually reduces the deficit, paid for out of a program that I care deeply about because I authored it in 2007, and prior to Senator Peters being a Senator, when he was in the House, he was the champion of the program that we are offering to use as a payfor. So I just want to remind everyone--and I am going to continue to come to the floor and remind colleagues every day--that a group of Americans in a city of 100,000 where there has been a Federal emergency declared are still waiting for us to act to help them--not to do the whole thing, not to pay for all of what needs to be done in terms of water infrastructure, but to do our part as a Federal Government, as we have done in communities across the country for other kinds of emergencies. We need to help the children of Flint. Nine thousand children under the age of six are being exposed to lead poisoning; some homes have exposure higher than a toxic waste dump. I can tell my colleagues as a mother and now as a grandmother, I would never tolerate something like that. I can't imagine what is happening for families. We have the opportunity to do something. It is easy. It is fully paid for. It is fully paid for by something that colleagues on the other side of the aisle have wanted to eliminate--fully paid for. It helps communities across the country. Now we have a situation where one Member has indicated, well, it is not his problem. He doesn't care; it is not his problem. I hope as Americans we are willing to say that other people's problems--I would think we care about them, whether it is our own children, our own grandchildren, people we know or not. That is what we expect when there are emergencies and disasters across the country. And whether it is in the farm bill that I worked on with the distinguished Presiding Officer where we strengthened livestock disaster assistance-- even though that is not a huge issue to me in the State of Michigan, but I know it is for a lot of States and a lot of communities. That is what we do as Americans. We care about people and communities. We have a group of people right now who are not being seen. I want my colleagues to see this baby and the picture this represents of a group of people who are waiting for help and deserve help. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. President, I wish to address something else now and turn to history to talk about somebody else who is waiting. He can drink his water and take a shower. That is a good thing. But we have a very distinguished jurist, the Chief Judge of the DC Court of Appeals, nominated by the President of the United States to be a Supreme Court Justice, who is waiting for the opportunity to be heard, to have a hearing, to meet with people, to have a vote, yes or no. We have spoken a lot about the Constitution, about responsibilities, about debates. Our three branches of government are sworn to uphold both the written word of the Constitution and the spirit of the Constitution. This spirit was expressed in a series of articles beginning in 1787. I wasn't there at the time. But in reading what our Founding Fathers said--those who framed the Constitution--I think it is important to look at what they intended through the Federalist Papers. On April 1, 1788, Alexander Hamilton, writing in Federalist Paper No. 76, outlined two specific roles for Supreme Court nominees: that the President nominate Justices and the Senate provide advice and consent. Hamilton explained how the Senate held the power to reject a nominee, to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from family connection, from personal attachment, or from other biases. As my colleagues know, Senators can investigate the character of a nominee by meeting the nominee in person, by holding hearings, and by looking at their writings. At the Senate Judiciary Committee they can ask the nominee questions in full view of the public. Based on responses, if they believe a nominee does not have the appropriate character, they can reject the nomination. They can vote no. That is our right as Senators. But Senators in the current Republican majority are refusing to do any of that. They have said they will not hold hearings. Most of them will not even meet with the nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. I want to commend Republican Senators who are, in fact, meeting with Judge Garland. This is their job. This is our job--the job established for us by America's Founding Fathers--and a majority of the majority is refusing to do it. Now, according to the average time for moving a Supreme Court nominee through the process, if the Republican majority did their job, as previous Senates did, then there would be a hearing of the Judiciary Committee by April 27, but there is none scheduled. The Judiciary Committee would hold a vote by May 12, but there is no vote coming. And based on historical precedent, the Supreme Court nominee would then come to the floor for a vote on confirmation before Memorial Day. But because my colleagues across the aisle are refusing to do their job, that vote will not happen. My Republican colleagues like to say that the Senate does not confirm Supreme Court nominees during a Presidential year, but that doesn't square with the facts. More than a dozen Supreme Court nominees have been confirmed by the Senate in an election year. In 1988, also a Presidential year, the Senate did its job by confirming President Reagan's Supreme Court nominee, Justice Anthony Kennedy, with a Democratically controlled Senate. In 1940, another Presidential election year, the Senate did its job by confirming President Franklin Roosevelt's nominee, Justice Frank Murphy. In 1932, the Senate did its job by confirming President Hoover's Supreme Court nominee. In 1916, the Senate did its job twice by confirming President Wilson's two nominees for the Supreme Court. The U.S. Constitution was ratified in June 1788, just a few months after Hamilton published the Federalist Paper I mentioned a few minutes ago. And for nearly 228 years--228 years--during times of war, times of peace, periods of prosperity, and periods of economic hardship, America has balanced the powers between the executive and the legislative branches in selecting who would serve in the third branch of government. We have done it during Democratic majorities and Republican majorities for 228 years. To those who are refusing to hold hearings on a nomination, my question is this: What has changed? What has changed this year? What is it about this President that causes him to be treated this way? What is it that is leading my colleagues to question the judgment and the wisdom of Alexander Hamilton and the rest of the Founding Fathers who signed the Constitution and gave us the responsibility for advice and consent? In short, why now are you refusing to do your job? Just do your job. Do what we are paid to do. Last month, I went over in front of the Supreme Court on a beautiful, sunny day when a lot of people were here visiting, and I talked to a number of citizens and asked them what they thought about what was happening, the debate going on about filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. I also asked them what would happen to you if during a year you told your employer that a major part of your job--a very big responsibility that you have in your job--you were going to refuse to do for a year or so. What would happen? Well, the answer is pretty easy. People said: I would be fired. People say: Why aren't you doing your job? Why isn't the majority doing its job? Because if you are not willing to do the work, why should you have the job? Nobody else can do that in their job. [[Page S1793]] That is why the polls show overwhelmingly that the American people side with those of us on the Democratic side, with all of us who stand together as Democratic Senators to say: Do your job. We are willing to do our job. People stand with the Constitution and with the overwhelming history of our country. It is very simple. It is a very simple idea. It is a phrase we say all the time in all kinds of circumstances. We say to our children, we say to people we work with: Just do your job. Well, this is our job. Hold a hearing, meet with the nominee, have a vote. You can vote yes; you can vote no. You could skip that day. But this judge deserves a vote, and it is our responsibility to vote and to fill the vacancy on the highest Court in the land. That is what the American people expect us to do. That is what they deserve. It is time that the Senate do its job. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss several provisions in an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill that is currently before the Senate and that specifically benefits my home State of Louisiana. There are more than 253 air traffic control towers throughout the country operating through a successful public-private partnership called the Federal Contract Tower Program. This program is especially critical to rural areas--as I have in Louisiana and as does the Presiding Officer--to ensure that America's airspace and the traveling public are safe. However, there are currently 30 towers awaiting the FAA to finalize an internal agency formula called the benefit-cost analysis, referred to as the BCA, which will allow eligible towers to enter the Federal Contract Tower Program. One of these airports is the Hammond Northshore Regional Airport in Hammond, LA. The Federal Contract Tower Program has been in place for more than 30 years and is a prime example of an effective public-private partnership between government and the private sector. Contract towers handle approximately 28 percent of the Nation's air traffic control tower operations but account for only 14 percent of the FAA's total tower operations budget. Repeated studies by the U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general have shown that the Contract Tower Program increases aviation safety while reducing costs to taxpayers and the Federal Government. It is also important to note that approximately 80 percent of the contract controller workforce are veterans. Congress has demonstrated numerous times in bipartisan fashion the merit and need for the Federal Contract Tower Program. Given the success of the program and the increasing likelihood of further FAA delays, I am pleased the Commerce Committee included language in the FAA reauthorization bill to strengthen and improve the Federal Contract Tower Program. Senators Cornyn, Vitter, Portman, and Wicker have been leaders on this issue, and their work is greatly appreciated. Currently, America's trade and economy are being hampered because many cargo planes from other countries are prohibited from flying into U.S. airports because they have not been upgraded to newer types of technology. Some aircraft are what is called ``Stage 2 aircraft.'' These aircraft were phased out following the passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, which mandated the phaseout for Stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds. I have introduced an amendment that would permit flights to a small number of airports under limited circumstances for revenue and nonrevenue flights of Stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds. One of the airports that meets the criteria is the Acadiana Regional Airport in New Iberia, LA. This airport is located in a heavy industrial complex and surrounded by agricultural land. The Acadiana Regional Airport has an advantage over other types of airports because it is surrounded by land use compatible with airport operations. Additionally, it is situated near the Port of Iberia, which is home to more than 100 companies employing close to 5,000 people in industries such as construction, energy, equipment rental, and trucking. This would bolster Louisiana's economy, help working families, and improve America's ability to trade with the world. Louisiana's economy relies on the thriving maritime industry. In 2014 a study from the Transportation Institute showed that 54,850 maritime- related jobs contribute more than $11 billion annually to Louisiana's economy. One in every 83 Louisiana jobs is connected to the domestic maritime industry, nearly twice that of any other State. With ports along the Mississippi and Red Rivers, our State sees vessels of varying sizes and types. While loading cargo, these ships must drain ballast water that they have taken on to maintain the balance of the ship. This can have varying degrees of environmental effects, with costly and confusing State and Federal regulations making compliance difficult. Senator Rubio is sponsoring the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, which creates a uniform, enforceable, and scientifically based national standard on ballast water discharges. This is needed in order to simplify the highly complicated and overly burdensome patchwork of State and Federal regulations that are in place today. Everyone I talk to in Louisiana's maritime industry and also in the inland marine, which would take the agriculture products from States such as the State the Presiding Officer represents, says it is necessary for these regulations to be harmonized, and they emphasize the importance of passing this bill. I am a cosponsor of this bill, and I am glad to see that Senator Rubio has filed the amendment to the bill we are considering on the floor today. The FAA Reauthorization Act contains many measures that will protect Americans, improve our economy, and protect our environment. I urge all my fellow Senators to support the bill and these amendments. I yield the floor. Amendment No. 3512, as Modified Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Aviation safety, as much as all national security, must be of paramount importance. I am increasingly concerned with reports from across the country that Secure Identification Display Area, SIDA, badges have gone missing, either through loss or theft. These badges, which grant access to secure areas of airports, allow employees to bypass traditional security checkpoints and, in the wrong hands, can pose a considerable security threat. An amendment considered and adopted earlier today by the Senate, Thune amendment No. 3512, is aimed at addressing this problem and would implement additional accountability and oversight methods to ensure that these SIDA badges do not fall into the wrong hands. It would provide for further employer accountability and allow for increased fines and enforcement actions against workers that fail to report the loss or theft of a badge. These are well-intentioned goals and ones that I support. I opposed this amendment, however, because extraneous provisions included in the amendment directly contradict bipartisan efforts in this Congress to reform our criminal justice system, including by reducing unnecessary barriers to employment for people with criminal records. The amendment will require the TSA Administrator to propose increasing the lookback period from 10 years to 15 years for background checks of airport and airline workers who have or are seeking SIDA badges. Under current regulations, there are a number of offenses that disqualify a potential employee, if the individual was convicted of the offense during the 10-year lookback period. The amendment would also require the TSA Administrator to consider adding more offenses to the list of disqualifying crimes. Disqualifying offenses already include a number of low-level offenses, such as felony drug possession. These provisions would exacerbate barriers to reentry. The scope of the changes will still exclude many potential employees and lead to the firing of a number of current employees. [[Page S1794]] I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks a letter from Transport Workers Union of America, the AFL-CIO, the Association of Flight Attendants, CWA--the Communication Workers of America, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Transportation Trades Department--AFL-CIO, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Employment Law Project in opposition to this amendment. I am committed to working with Senator Thune to ensure greater accountability for Secure Identification Display Area badges. It must be a priority. I hope that he and others will work with me through the conference of this bill to eliminate these barriers to employment for individuals with certain criminal records. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: April 6, 2016. Oppose the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361) as an Amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act (H.R. 636) Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to oppose any efforts to expand background checks on aviation workers as proposed in the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361). In particular, we are opposed to the inclusion of S. 2361 as an amendment to H.R. 636, the FAA Reauthorization Act, which is currently under consideration in the Senate. As drafted, S. 2361 would undermine reforms around the nation that have reduced barriers to employment of people with criminal records, thus representing a serious setback for the bipartisan criminal justice reform movement. The Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act would alter the requirements for airport workers to obtain Secure Identification Display Area (SIDA) badges by instructing the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator to propose increasing the lookback period on many aviation workers' employment background checks from 10 years to 15 years. This provision undermines the goal of promoting rehabilitation, and it conflicts with the substantial research documenting that criminal history lookback periods should not extend back more than seven years. The bill also instructs the TSA Administrator to consider increasing disqualifying criminal offenses to include crimes that do not appear to be related to transportation security. These reforms would have far reaching impact and exacerbate barriers to reentry. As many as one in three Americans have a criminal record and nearly half of U.S. children have a parent with a criminal record, creating life-long barriers to opportunity, including employment, for entire families. This change will also have an overwhelming discriminatory impact on communities of color, who have been hardest hit by a flawed criminal justice system. Moreover, this proposal does not account for the compelling evidence documenting the impact of gainful employment on those who have previously been convicted of a crime. Full integration into society is essential to successful anti-terror programs and efforts to lower recidivism rates. By requiring the dismissal of many current employees who have worked in a position for years, the legislation ignores these widely accepted principles. We do support some elements of this legislation. The bill would create a waiver process for those who are denied credentials. This would ensure the consideration of circumstances from which it may be concluded that an individual does not pose a risk of terrorism or to security. The waiver process would consider the circumstances surrounding an offense, restitution, mitigation remedies, and other factors. This provision is modeled on a very successful program in the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), a credential that is similar to a SIDA, which is used at secure areas of port facilities. We strongly encourage you oppose the inclusion of any amendment providing blanket categorical exclusions that would increase background checks on aviation workers and act as additional barriers to the employment of people with criminal records. Thank you for your consideration. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Brendan Danaher, Director of Government Affairs at the Transport Workers Union, or Greg Regan, Senior Legislative Representative at the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO. Sincerely, Transport Workers Union of America. AFL-CIO. Association of Flight Attendants--CWA. Communication Workers of America. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. National Employment Law Project. Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO. VOTE EXPLANATION Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was absent from today's votes on three amendments to the pending business, H.R. 636, the vehicle for a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, due to events I attended with President Obama in Illinois. Had I been present, my votes would have been as follows. On rollcall vote No. 41, Thune amendment No. 3512, as modified, I would have voted against adoption. I am concerned about the impact that a provision in this amendment will have on formerly incarcerated individuals who have successfully reintegrated into society after completing sentences for low-level crimes unrelated to transportation security. The provision, which will make it more difficult for these individuals to obtain certain aviation jobs years after a criminal conviction, undermines efforts to reduce barriers to reentry, lower recidivism rates, and reform our criminal justice system. On rollcall vote No. 42, Heinrich amendment No. 3482, as modified, I would have voted in favor of adoption. This amendment will further strengthen the homeland by increasing security in soft targets at airports, in areas like check-ins and baggage claims, where terrorists recently carried out deadly attacks in Brussels. The amendment will expand and enhance visible deterrents, create a new eligible use under Homeland Security grants for training exercises to enhance preparedness for active shooter incidents, and authorize and make explicit that Homeland Security grants can be used for airport and surface transportation in these nonsecure soft target areas. I am proud to have cosponsored this amendment. On rollcall vote No. 43, Schumer amendment No. 3483, I would have voted in favor of adoption. This amendment would establish consumer safeguards like minimum standards for space for passengers on aircrafts, including the size and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room, and the width of aisles. As these votes demonstrate, after a series of temporary extensions, the Senate is finally considering a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. In light of recent threats both here and abroad, it is important that we get this right. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis on these important security reforms, consumer protections, and other pressing aviation-related issues in the coming days and weeks. Mr. CASSIDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so ordered. UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, April 11, at 5 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 215; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1778-S1794] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 636, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 636) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. Pending: Thune/Nelson amendment No. 3464, in the nature of a substitute. Thune (for Gardner) amendment No. 3460 (to amendment No. 3464), to require the FAA Administrator to consider the operational history of a person before authorizing the person to operate certain unmanned aircraft systems. Thune amendment No. 3512 (to amendment No. 3464), to enhance airport security. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have the FAA bill on the floor. I would like to discuss some of the amendments that are proposed and, hopefully, a couple that we will be voting on this morning. There are a couple of amendments--one offered by Senator Thune on behalf of himself and this Senator, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, and another offered by Senator Heinrich. Both amendments deal with the issue of security but in different arenas. Let me explain. The Thune-Nelson amendment applies to the question of perimeter security, of allowing employees to get into an airport--not the sterile area controlled by TSA, although, as I will explain, it can definitely affect the sterile area as well. On the other hand, the Heinrich amendment addresses security in the areas where passengers bunch up outside of TSA security, such as in a queue-up line going through TSA security, or passengers bunched up at the ticket counters, checking in their luggage. Either way, as we saw from the experience of the Brussels airport explosion, those are very tempting targets for a terrorist. Therefore, the proposal in the Heinrich amendment, which I would commend to the Senate, is to increase the level of security, particularly with what are called VIPR teams, which, in essence, are not only at airports but at seaports and at transportation hubs. Remember that in Brussels there was a bombing in one of the train stations as well. So we need to increase the surveillance and the security there, including dogs. As a matter of fact, our K-9 friends are some of the best that we have when it comes to protecting us because their noses are attuned to being able to sniff out the explosives that you cannot detect with metal detectors or with the AIT machine that we go through where we hold up our hands to see if we have anything on us. It can detect if you have a package, if you have an explosive that is somewhere in one of your body cavities. It is going to be very, very difficult. Dogs, because of their God-given sense of smell, can detect that. A properly trained dog is just amazing to watch. Now, interestingly, concurrently there is research going on at NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, for an artificial dog nose, a mechanical item or a piece of software and hardware that would actually do the same job. But that has not been perfected yet. That is going to be really interesting to see what they come up with. This Senator will report to the Senate later on that. But for the time being, the Heinrich amendment, which I hope we will vote on this morning, is concerned with that security that we have seen as a result of the Brussels bombing. We certainly want to enhance security in our airports. Thank goodness we have the intelligence apparatus that we do in this country to be able to smoke out the terrorist before he ever does his dirty deed. It is more difficult for them to do it here in America than it is in Europe because of the alienation of those communities that then harbor the terrorists. We see the result in Brussels as well as Paris. That is the Heinrich amendment. That is a broad characterization of it, but basically that is the thrust. The Thune-Nelson amendment is going at the perimeter security. OK, think Egypt and the Russian airliner. It was an airport employee who smuggled the bomb onto the plane, not as a passenger but as an airport employee. Think the Atlanta airport, 2 years ago. In a gunrunning scheme over 3 months, over 100 guns were transported from Atlanta to New York. The police in New York could not figure out how all of these guns were getting on the streets in New York. They kept checking the trains, and they kept checking the interstates. They could not figure it out. Here is how they did it. An employee at the Atlanta airport--because Atlanta was not checking their employees--would smuggle the guns in. Then that employee had access in the terminal to get into the sterile area--the TSA sterile area--and he would go into the men's room, meet the passenger who had already come through security and was clean, and give the guns to him to put them in his empty knapsack, his backpack. This employee, over the course of 17 times, over 3 months, smuggled over 100 guns. Thank goodness it was a criminal enterprise, not a terrorist, because you can imagine what would have happened. The Miami International Airport 10 years ago figured this out. What they did was, instead of having hundreds of entry points into the airport for airport employees in a very large airport like Atlanta, in Miami they boiled it down to a handful. There the employees went through similar security that passengers do to check to see if they had any weapons. They had a special identification card that they would have to stick into an electronic machine and put in their code, which was another way of checking to make sure that the employee was who they said they were. Miami solved the problem after having a problem with drugs 10 years ago. Interestingly, in the interim, the Orlando International Airport, likewise, about 4 years ago had a similar drug problem. They did the same thing. They boiled down hundreds of entry points for airport employees to a handful. They had those checks. I have gone to see those checks at those two airports. That is exactly how they do it. The fact is, we have 300 airports in the United States. There were only two that were doing this kind of perimeter checking. Atlanta then became the [[Page S1779]] poster boy of what can happen in a gunrunning scheme. I am happy to report to the Senate that, in fact, the Atlanta airport has now done exactly what Miami and Orlando have done. But we have 297 other airports that need to do the same thing. So the Thune-Nelson amendment is exactly getting at that kind of perimeter security situation. I highly commend both the Thune-Nelson amendment as well as the Heinrich amendment. There are a whole bunch of cosponsors--bipartisan--on each of these. I highly recommend both of these to the Senate. I hope we will vote on those today--hopefully, this morning. Now, there are going to be, of course, a series of many other amendments, some very well intentioned that have some technical glitches, and we have our very expert staff right now starting to try to work out some of these technical glitches. Then we can get moving with this FAA bill. I would mention one other amendment that this Senator will be offering, and that is on a cyber security bill. Did the Presiding Officer see the ``60 Minutes'' segment where people with a laptop could take over an automobile by going through the electronics of the automobile? They can speed it up, they can make it stop it, and they can make it turn and completely take over the operation of an automobile. Can the Presiding Officer imagine somebody being able to do that with an airliner with 250 people on board? Therefore, whether we want to face it or not, we better face it because we are in an era that what we need to do is to make sure technically that the systems in an airliner are separate, that there is an air gap, and that whatever those systems are--it might be Wi-Fi for the airplane, it might be music, or it may be whatever it is--there is an air gap so that someone cannot go into that system and suddenly get into the aircraft controls. That is super important. One other thing I would mention is what we know as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. They have become quite popular. But, obviously, one of the things that is already in the bill, which Senator Thune and I have insisted on as we approach this FAA bill, is that we have to come face-to-face with the reality that drones are now impairing the safety of an ascending or a descending aircraft. We have seen--the two of us--an operation where you can now take over the operation of a drone. Education can do so much. People have to understand that you basically have to not fly a drone within 5 miles of an airport. Just recently, at Miami International Airport, there was an inbound American Airlines plane, and there was a drone about 1,000 feet off on the left side. Remember Captain Sully Sullenberger, when a flock of geese suddenly got sucked into the engines and all power was lost. Fortunately, he had the Hudson River that he could belly it in after he had taken off from LaGuardia. You put a drone with plastic and metal, let that get sucked into the engine, and you will have a catastrophic failure. You don't want to put your passengers in that kind of operation. Therefore, education is one thing, but there is always going to be a young person that does not know about this. We don't know the answer. We know we can take over the operation of the drone, send it over here, have it set down, and have it land. The technology is there, but how do we apply that technology so we avoid this aircraft collision? There is an increasing use of drones that are so helpful for so many commercial purposes, not to mention the pure pleasure of flying a drone around, which we are seeing has become exceptionally popular. We address that in the bill by giving the appropriate direction to the FAA to start coming up with the solutions of how we are going to protect aircraft in and around airports. On down the line, there are going to be so many different issues with regard to drones, far beyond the scope of the FAA bill. On the question of privacy--a drone suddenly coming down and coming at eye level outside your bedroom window snooping--there are all kinds of questions about privacy. What about the fact that you can now put a gun on a drone? We know in a war zone we have the capability of doing that with very sophisticated weapons, such as Hellfire missiles, but now some people are experimenting with putting a gun on a drone. We have the ramifications of what that means for society to deal with in the future. For the immediate future, the FAA bill on the floor--we have this problem of avoiding drones colliding into aircraft, and that is in the bill and it is addressed. We have a lot of interesting issues to talk about. Let's get the Senate on it, and hopefully we can get agreement so we can at least vote on two of these amendments this morning. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3482, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3464 Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3482, as modified, and ask that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Heinrich] proposes an amendment numbered 3482, as modified, to amendment No. 3464. The amendment, as modified, is as follows: (Purpose: To expand and enhance visible deterrents at major transportation hubs and to increase the resources to protect and secure the United States) At the end of title V, insert the following: SEC. 5032. VISIBLE DETERRENT. Section 1303 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/ 11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1112) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (A) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a semicolon; (B) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (C) by adding at the end the following: ``(5) if the VIPR team is deployed to an airport, shall require, as appropriate based on risk, that the VIPR team conduct operations-- ``(A) in the sterile area and any other areas to which only individuals issued security credentials have unescorted access; and ``(B) in non-sterile areas.''; and (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2007 through 2011'' and inserting ``such sums as necessary, including funds to develop not more than 60 VIPR teams, for fiscal years 2016 through 2017''. SEC. 5033. LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING FOR MASS CASUALTY AND ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENTS. Section 2006(a)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 607(a)(2)) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (E) through (I) as subparagraphs (F) through (J), respectively; and (2) by inserting after subparagraph (D) the following: ``(E) training exercises to enhance preparedness for and response to mass casualty and active shooter incidents and security events at public locations, including airports and mass transit systems;''. SEC. 5034. ASSISTANCE TO AIRPORTS AND SURFACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. Section 2008(a) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609(a)) is amended-- (1) by redesigning paragraphs (9) through (13) as paragraphs (10) through (14), respectively; and (2) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following: ``(9) enhancing the security and preparedness of secure and non-secure areas of eligible airports and surface transportation systems.''. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, this amendment would strengthen U.S. airport security, especially in nonsecure or soft-target areas of airports--places such as check-in and baggage claim areas. It would also update Federal security programs to provide active shooter training for law enforcement and increase the presence of Federal agents with bomb-sniffing canines at these nonsecure areas. I thank the cosponsors of the amendment: Senator Manchin, Senator Schumer, Senator Nelson, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cantwell, Senator Carper, Senator Baldwin, Senator Durbin, Senator Bennet, and Senator Blumenthal. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the adoption of this amendment. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. [[Page S1780]] The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill and ask consent to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Pennsylvania Senator Toomey to talk about an issue we began to discuss on the floor yesterday, but we have been working many months on this issue. It is a rather simple issue, but it is a matter that has some real urgency connected to it because we are talking about a secondary barrier on airplanes--meaning a barrier other than what we know now to be a reinforced cockpit door--to prevent terrorists from getting into the cockpit. What we need to do in addition to that, after Congress mandated the installation of these reinforced cockpit doors, is add a secondary barrier. This is something that arises because we not only know from the attack on 9/11 but thereafter, we know that, No. 1, this is still an intention that terrorists have to take over an airplane. We know since 9/11, 51-- I will correct the record from yesterday, I think I said 15, I had transposed the number--but it is 51 hijacking attempts around the world since 9/11. This is not a problem that is going away, and we have to deal with it. This is the barrier we are talking about. So people understand the nature of this barrier, this is a lightweight wire mesh gate that would prevent a terrorist from getting into the cockpit or even getting to the door of the cockpit, which, as we said, is already reinforced. What it does fundamentally is block access to the flight deck. That is what we are talking about. That is what our amendment does. We know the substantial number of groups that support this. I will just read the list for the record. And this actually is support for the underlying bill that Senator Toomey and I and others have been working on for a while. The underlying bill itself was S. 911. Also, the amendment, amendment No. 3458, is endorsed by the following groups: the Airline Pilots Association, the Allied Pilots Association, the Association of Flight Attendants, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the US Airline Pilots Association, the Coalition of Airline Pilots Association, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, and Families of September 11. There have been numerous studies done. I am holding a study--although you can't see it from a distance--which was conducted by the Cato Institute, among others, on terrorism risk and cost-benefit analysis of aviation security. So we not only have substantial support from virtually every group you could point toward, but we have some expertise on how to protect pilots in the cockpit, how to protect passengers on an airplane, and, of course, how to do that by preventing terrorists from getting through or near the cockpit because of a good secondary barrier. This effort started literally from folks we now know in Pennsylvania. It started with, among other people, the Saracini family, Ellen Saracini, the wife of Captain Victor Saracini, who piloted United Flight 175, which terrorists hijacked and flew into the World Trade Center on 9/11. So in memory of Captain Saracini and inspired by the great work of his wife Ellen Saracini, we offer this amendment. Again, I am very pleased to be working on this with my colleague Senator Toomey, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to underscore the points made by my colleague Senator Casey. I thank him for his leadership. This is a very simple matter that is very straightforward and common sense. We know there is a very real vulnerability in our commercial aircraft. We know this. There is no mystery here. And we have a very simple, affordable, reasonable solution that will provide the security we need. After September 11, 2001, Congress very rightly mandated that the cockpit door be reinforced so that it is virtually impossible to destroy that door, to knock down that door, to defeat the purpose of that door when it is closed and latched. The problem is that when it is open--which it must be open periodically during many flights--a very strong door is useless. We know what happens now on airlines because we have all witnessed it, right? When a pilot needs to come out or go in or there is access to the cockpit when that door is open, the flight attendant rolls a little serving cart in front of the door. I suppose that is better than nothing, but it is not much better than nothing. That cart can be rolled away. We are not the only ones who have observed this. An FAA advisory has observed this risk. The 9/11 Commission pointed out that the terrorists were very focused on the opportunity created by the opening of the cockpit door. As Senator Casey pointed out, there have been multiple attempts to breach that door. Several have been successful. We have an amendment that solves this problem in a very affordable, reasonable, sensible way. It is a lightweight, collapsible barrier made of wire mesh, and a flight attendant can simply draw it across the opening, lock it, and then at that point the cockpit door can be opened and there is no way someone would be able to rush through that wire mesh in time to get to the cockpit during that moment when the door is open. That is what our amendment does. It passed the Transportation Committee in the House unanimously. As Senator Casey pointed out, it has very broad support from many of the stakeholders who care about the security of our commercial aviation. It is our hope and understanding that we will be very soon propounding a unanimous consent agreement which will allow this amendment to be pending and that this will be one of the amendments which will be on the docket for a subsequent vote. I hope we will get to that momentarily. I hope we will get that locked in, and then I would urge my colleagues to vote yes on our amendment and enhance commercial aviation safety. I yield the floor. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important matter before the Senate, the reauthorization of our Nation's Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA is tasked with a critical mission to manage the safety and the security of our Nation's airspace. Our Nation's airspace is an incredible resource that fuels our economy. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in 2015, a record 896 million passengers traversed America's skies. Our aviation system contributes $1.5 trillion to our Nation's economy and it supports 11.8 million jobs for hard-working Americans, as noted by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The Senate's FAA reauthorization bill will make our aviation system stronger for families, children, veterans, and the traveling public. It will also benefit Nebraska's rural airports and local aviation stakeholders. Notably, this carefully negotiated bill will strengthen America's aviation system without raising fees or taxes on airline passengers. Our robust, bipartisan legislation includes several major priorities I championed. I am proud of bipartisan language I worked to include in the bill, along with Senators Booker, Cantwell, and Ayotte. Our provision would compel the FAA to work with the airline industry to comprehensively assess and update guidelines for emergency medical kits on commercial aircraft. These kits, which haven't been statutorily updated since 1998, provide lifesaving resources for passengers. It is well past time for the FAA to evaluate medications and equipment included in these kits. Doing so will ensure all passengers, [[Page S1781]] particularly families with young infants facing unknown allergic reactions, have access to the medical supplies they might need in an emergency situation. In addition, I worked with Senator McCaskill to include an amendment that would make it easier for traveling mothers to care for their young infants. Our amendment unanimously passed the Commerce Committee. We worked closely with airport stakeholders, including Omaha's Eppley Airfield, to establish reasonable minimum standards for both medium- and large-hub airports to develop private rooms for nursing mothers in future capital development plans. Traveling as a new mom can be challenging and it can be stressful at times, but I believe this important change will provide increased flexibility and also peace of mind for mothers traveling through airports across our country. I also joined Senator Hirono to include an amendment that would ensure disabled veterans working at the FAA have access to service- connected disability leave. The FAA was one of the few agencies not included in the recently passed Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act. That bill required Federal agencies to ensure disabled vets have access to service-connected disability leave. Our disabled veterans bravely served our country, and they deserve access to benefits they have earned. I am grateful for the achievements this bill will advance for the flying public. At the same time, the bill is also a victory for Nebraska's rural communities and airports. The Small Airport Regulation Relief Act, which is included in the FAA bill, would create a temporary exemption for small airports so they can continue to receive airport improvement program funds--those AIP funds--despite downturns in air service. The survival of smaller airports, such as Scottsbluff's Western Nebraska Regional Airport, depends on these crucial funds to provide service to local passengers and businesses. Several of Nebraska's small and community airports, such as Alliance, Chadron, Grand Island, McCook, North Platte, and Scottsbluff, will also benefit from a continuation of the Essential Air Service, or EAS, Program. The EAS Program incentivizes air carriers to provide service to underserved and rural areas, and it is critical to ensuring air service continues for Nebraska's rural communities. Meanwhile, the Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island is growing and hosts a privately operated Federal contract tower. I encouraged the inclusion of provisions to compel the FAA to complete a pending cost-benefit analysis for Federal contract tower airports. This analysis would reflect the cost-share arrangement more accurately between our local airports and the FAA for those contract towers. Through this legislation, we can help to reduce the burden on local airports such as Grand Island, NE. One of the major challenges facing aviation manufacturers has been the FAA's inconsistent and often unclear regulatory process. I collaborated with Duncan Aviation of Lincoln, NE, the largest family- owned maintenance, repair, and overhaul organization in the world, to address this challenge. In fact, Chairman Thune toured the facilities at Duncan Aviation with me in Lincoln last fall. Our bill would provide clarity to aviation businesses like Duncan Aviation by compelling the FAA to establish a centralized safety guidance database. Moreover, the bill would require the FAA to establish a Regulatory Consistency Communications Board. The Board would set standards to ensure the consistent application of regulations and guidance at regional offices throughout our country. Agricultural aviators in Nebraska will also benefit from safety enhancements in this bill. Far too many of our agricultural pilots have died in recent years after collisions with unmarked utility towers. This legislation would ensure that towers are marked to create safer skies for our agriculture pilots. Passing our FAA bill will be a major accomplishment for the Senate. I appreciate and commend the hard work of Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and their committee staffers on this meaningful FAA reauthorization bill. In the coming days, I look forward to working together to help pass this critical legislation that will benefit the flying public, our national aviation system, and Nebraska's rural airports and aviation stakeholders. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE.

SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act''. SEC. _102. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) A number of recent airport security breaches in the United States have involved the use of Secure Identification Display Area (referred to in this section as ``SIDA'') badges, the credentials used by airport and airline workers to access the secure areas of an airport. (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged with using his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a number of months via commercial aircraft. (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation Safety Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and transport a firearm in his carry-on luggage. (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation found that over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport were lost or missing. (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, Transportation Security Administration contractors were indicted for participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed through the secure area of the San Francisco International Airport. (6) The Administration has indicated that it does not maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead relies on airport operators to track airport worker credentials. (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain threshold of missing SIDA badges. (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access control. (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security reported that the Administration did not have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers who had records in United States intelligence-related databases because the Administration was not authorized to receive all terrorism-related information under current interagency watchlisting policy. (10) The Inspector General also found that the Administration did not have appropriate checks in place to reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment investigations, including criminal history record checks and work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight over the airport operators that the Administration relies on to perform criminal history and work authorization checks for airport workers. (11) There is growing concern about the potential insider threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities. SEC. _103. DEFINITIONS.

Amendment No. 3512, as Modified Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might just speak to amendment No. 3512, which we will be voting on momentarily, I know Senator Nelson has already spoken on this issue. We worked very hard on a series of security bills that we could bring to the floor. We are trying to move them separately, but I think they fit nicely into the debate we are having on the FAA reauthorization. Senators Nelson, Ayotte, Cantwell, and I have been leading oversight of airport and airline workers abusing their secure area access badges. This oversight led our committee to approve bipartisan legislation--S. 2361, Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act--to tighten the vetting of airport workers with ties to terrorists and serious criminal behavior that should disqualify them from accessing sensitive airport areas. Just in the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers have been caught in the act of helping criminal organizations. On March 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine after being confronted by transportation security officers in California. On March 26 in Florida, an airline gate agent was arrested with a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an associate. As we work to address the threat of an aviation insider helping terrorists, [[Page S1786]] criminals who break laws for financial gain and those with a history of violence are a really good place to start. It is high time that we start cracking down on these types of offenses for people who are working in sensitive areas of our airports. U.S. terrorism experts believe that ISIS is recruiting criminals to join its ranks in Europe, and some of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in Brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals. Ensuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that experts believe an ISIS affiliate may have planted a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight leaving Egypt with the help of an airport employee, which killed 224 people on board. The recent attacks by ISIS in the unsecured area of the Brussels Airport also underscore the vulnerability of airport areas outside of TSA security screening checkpoints. The House of Representatives and the Commerce Committee also approved legislation--H.R. 2843, the PreCheck Expansion Act--in December of 2015 to expand the PreCheck program by developing private sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. These private sector partners would be required to use an assessment equivalent to a fingerprint-based criminal history record check conducted through the FBI. These changes would increase the number of passengers who are vetted before they get to the airport. As a result, more passengers would receive expedited airport screening and get through security checkpoints more quickly, ensuring they don't pose the kind of easy target that the ISIS suicide bombers exploited at the Brussels Airport. In addition to the bills approved by our committee on March 23, the House Homeland Security Committee approved H.R. 4698, the SAFE GATES Act of 2016, which would strengthen security at international airports with direct flights to the United States. Specifically, the bill would require TSA to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of all last- point-of-departure airports, a security coordination enhancement plan, and a workforce assessment. It would authorize the TSA to donate security screening equipment to foreign last-point-of-departure airports and to evaluate foreign countries' air cargo security programs to prevent any shipment of nefarious materials via air cargo. I believe these bills will help make air travel more secure, and they should advance in the full Senate in this amendment to the FAA bill. I encourage my colleagues to support the Thune-Nelson amendment and then also follow-on with the Heinrich amendment, which will come up shortly after a vote on that amendment. I think the Heinrich amendment also makes a number of important security improvements that will also strengthen airport security. There has been a discussion about whether there ought to be more VIPR teams. I think there are 30 or so at this point, and the amendment would allow that number to go up to 60. Yesterday we had the opportunity to question the TSA Administrator, Admiral Neffenger, about whether additional VIPR teams would be useful. He said they could put to use anything they were given in terms of additional units that might be deployed to places around the country where they think there is a need. So that is the principal component of the Heinrich amendment, which also addresses some of the security issues. I don't think we can understate how important security is in light of everything that is going on in the world today. We have people who want to harm Americans, and it is our job to make sure we are giving those authorities who are there to prevent those types of attacks against Americans all the tools they need in order to do their jobs effectively. I encourage our colleagues here in the Senate--when we have an opportunity to vote here momentarily on both of these security amendments--to support those amendments. They improve and strengthen security at our airports around this country, and I think they fit nicely within the context of the FAA reauthorization bill and the debate we are currently having on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida. Amendment No. 3483 to Amendment No. 3464 Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up Schumer amendment No. 3483 and ask that the Schumer and Bennet amendments be Nelson for Schumer and Bennet. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 3483 to amendment No. 3464. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To require the Federal Aviation Administration to establish minimum standards for space for passengers on passenger aircraft) At the end of subtitle A of title III, add the following: SEC. 3124. REGULATIONS RELATING TO SPACE FOR PASSENGERS ON AIRCRAFT. (a) Moratorium on Reductions to Aircraft Seat Size.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prohibit any air carrier from reducing the size, width, padding, or pitch of seats on passenger aircraft operated by the air carrier, the amount of leg room per seat on such aircraft, or the width of aisles on such aircraft. (b) Regulations Relating to Space for Passengers on Aircraft.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall prescribe regulations-- (1) establishing minimum standards for space for passengers on passenger aircraft, including the size, width, padding, and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room per seat, and the width of aisles on such aircraft for the safety, health, and comfort of passengers; and (2) requiring each air carrier to prominently display on the website of the air carrier the amount of space available for each passenger on passenger aircraft operated by the air carrier, including the size, width, padding, and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room per seat, and the width of aisles on such aircraft. (c) Consultations.--In prescribing the regulations required by subsection (b), the Administrator shall consult with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, passenger advocacy organizations, physicians, and ergonomic engineers. (d) Air Carrier Defined.--In this section, the term ``air carrier'' means an air carrier (as defined in section 40102 of title 49, United States Code) that transports passengers by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in just 5 minutes we will have our first series of votes on amendments on this bill. This is a good start to the FAA bill. It is improving the underlying bill that has a lot of attention to security already in it. But these are clearly amendments that will improve the bill. I spoke about it earlier today. I certainly commend these amendments to the Senate. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Vote on Amendment No. 3512, as modified. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3512, as modified, offered by the Senator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I yield back whatever time remains. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Further, if present and voting the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) would have voted ``yea.'' [[Page S1787]] Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Amendment No. 3482, as Modified The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3482, as modified, offered by the Senator from New Mexico. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, airports, bus depots, and train stations are things that we all rely on every day to have the freedom of movement we enjoy in this country. In the wake of the recent terror attacks in the Brussels Airport and Metro, Americans are worried about their security, and they want to feel safe when traveling with their loved ones. While we relentlessly target terrorists overseas, we must also do all we can to intelligently protect Americans here at home. My amendment would increase the number of TSA VIPR teams, who provide a visible deterrent to terrorist threats in high-priority locations. These teams are recognizable as they often have bomb-sniffing canines. My amendment would also provide active shooter training for law enforcement and strengthen security in nonsecure so-called soft-target areas, such as check-in and baggage claim areas. By employing these additional commonsense safeguards, we will intelligently respond to these threats. Most importantly, by preserving our freedom to go about our daily lives, we will ensure that the terrorists have failed to change how we live and who we are. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the Heinrich amendment. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. Iranian Access to U.S. Financial System Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, when Obama administration officials sold the President's nuclear deal last summer to the American people, they were clearly sensitive to charges that they gave too much away. They knew that giving Iran $100 billion that we could never get back in exchange for a mere temporary deal that expired in 10 to 15 years would be viewed with deep skepticism. They knew that an inspection system that gives the ayatollahs a 24- day heads-up before an inspection would not pass the laugh test. They knew that granting the ayatollahs massive sanctions relief while still allowing them to develop an industrial-scale nuclear enrichment program would invite accusations that the President was, to put it frankly, swindled. So in their sales pitch, these administration officials sought to blunt these expected criticisms. They repeatedly stated that the United States would maintain certain tough sanctions, even after the deal became effective. They said the United States would hold the line on measures that punish and suppress Iran's nonnuclear malign activities. They emphatically stated that in no way would the U.S. economy be allowed to bolster an Iranian economy that is significantly controlled by the Iranian regime, tainted by illicit financing of terrorism, and used by the ayatollahs to fund domestic oppression and international aggression--including blowing up hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq with roadside bombs. In particular, these administration officials were emphatic that the United States would never, ever, ever grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system and U.S. dollars to facilitate Iran's trade in oil and other goods. For instance, when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew stated: Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with U.S. banks. Iran, in other words, will continue to be denied access to the world's largest financial and commercial market. Likewise, Adam Szubin, the Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, echoed that sentiment and was even more precise. In September he stated: Iran will not be able to open bank accounts with U.S. banks, nor will Iran be able to access the U.S. banking sector, even for that momentary transaction to, what we call, dollarize a foreign payment. . . . That is not in the cards. That is not part of the relief offered under the JCPOA. So, the U.S. sanctions on Iran, which, of course, had their origins long before Iran had a nuclear program, will remain in place. [[Page S1788]] It is difficult to overstate the importance of these statements uttered just a few months ago. The U.S. dollar is the standard currency in which international trade is conducted. Because the ayatollahs can't deal in dollars, they haven't fully opened their economy to the world-- thankfully. In addition, the U.S. financial system hasn't yet been tainted by Iran's terror financing, its international aggression, and its crackdown on domestic democratic dissent. But now, a mere 7 months into a 15-year agreement, the Obama administration is shedding the resolve its officials tried to so hard to display before Congress. According to numerous reports, the administration intends to backtrack on the statements of Secretary Lew and Adam Szubin. It is looking for some way, somehow to give Iran access to U.S. dollars to boost Iranian trade and investment. I want to be very clear. If the President moves to grant Iran access to the U.S. dollar--whether directly or indirectly--there will be consequences. If there is any statement, guidance, regulation, or Executive action that opens the U.S. banking sector to Iran even a crack, the Senate will hold hearings with each official who assured the American people last summer that the ayatollahs would never access the dollar. We will explore whether they lied back then or whether they intend to resign in protest now. If this policy change moves forward, I will dedicate myself to working with my colleagues to pass legislation blocking the change. If the Obama administration proceeds with this massive concession to the ayatollahs, every Member of the Senate who voted to accept the Iranian deal will have to go home and explain why the U.S. economy is now complicit in Iran's financing of terrorist attacks against Americans and American allies. That the Obama administration would even consider allowing Iran access to the U.S. banking sector is extremely disconcerting, but it is not surprising. It follows a steady pattern that has become increasingly clear since the conclusion of the nuclear deal. Time and again, Iran provokes the United States, commits brazen acts to destabilize its neighbors, and threatens to undo the Iran deal. In response, the United States rushes to grant the ayatollahs more concessions in order to placate them. Iran has tested ballistic missiles, captured U.S. sailors, and fueled conflicts in Syria and Yemen with fresh arms and troops--all while employing ``Death to America'' as a rallying cry. But in the face of Iran's continued aggression, the President has displayed only weakness. Instead of steeling himself for a fight with the ayatollahs, he has laid down and rolled over for them. He has repeatedly refused to designate Iran's tests of ballistic missiles as the violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions they so clearly are. The President also agreed to send an additional $1.7 billion to the ayatollahs, ostensibly to settle outstanding claims. For good measure, that $1.7 billion includes $1.3 billion in gratuitous interest payments. The President granted clemency to seven convicted Iranian criminals and dismissed arrest warrants for 14 Iranian fugitives who faced charges for sanctions violations. Now the President may be on the verge of granting the largest concession yet--dollarizing Iran's international trade and declaring Iran truly open for business. We should call this for what it is--concession creep. In the same manner that no Member of the Senate should trust Iran to abide by its commitments made in the Iranian nuclear deal, we can no longer trust the administration to hold fast to the specific concessions contained in the four corners of that deal. The ink is hardly dry on the deal, and the President has already shown himself all too susceptible to the temptations of appeasement. The ayatollahs reportedly have complained to U.S. officials that it is too hard to transact business without access to U.S. dollars. The answer to that should be ``too bad.'' It should not be easy for the world's worst sponsor of terrorism to do business with the global economy. It should not be easy for industries dominated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to trade in financial markets. International business leaders, directors, CEOs, and general counsels should not rush into Iran for fear of the grave reputational, financial, political, and legal consequences of doing business with this outlaw regime. The Iranians know the Obama administration is desperate to preserve the nuclear deal. They hold the possibility of walking away from the agreement as a sword of Damocles over the President's head in order to extract concession after concession. They lord it over him in order to forestall any U.S. action that would meaningfully stop their regional aggression and campaign of terror. So intense is President Obama's fear that the Ayatollah will rip up the nuclear agreement, he has completely upended U.S. strategy in the Middle East to the point where adversaries are allies and allies are becoming adversaries. This parade of concessions must stop, and it must stop now. The administration must fully implement all new sanctions passed by Congress to punish Iran's development of ballistic missiles, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its human rights abuses. It must work with our traditional allies in the Middle East to neutralize Iran's attempt to foment instability throughout the region. The President should issue a very clear order that Iran will not be granted any direct or indirect access to the U.S. banking system and the dollar. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. (The remarks of Mr. Merkley pertaining to the introduction of S. 2760 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Amendment No. 3490 to Amendment No. 3464 Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3490. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] proposes an amendment numbered 3490 to amendment No. 3464. Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To extend protections against physical assault to air carrier customer service representatives) Strike section 5009 and insert the following: SEC. 5009. INTERFERENCE WITH AIR CARRIER EMPLOYEES. (a) In General.--Section 46503 is amended by inserting after ``to perform those duties'' the following ``, or who assaults an air carrier customer representative in an airport, including a gate or ticket agent, who is performing the duties of the representative or agent,''. (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 46503 is amended in the section heading by inserting ``or air carrier customer representatives'' after ``screening personnel''. (c) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for chapter 465 is amended by striking the item relating to section 46503 and inserting the following: ``46503. Interference with security screening personnel or air carrier customer representatives.''. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up this amendment and offer it because the issue is making sure that those who work in the air transportation system are safe and secure. This is an important issue to the men and women who work at Sea-Tac and at other airports and are part of the delivery system of making sure air transportation is safe. They are an integral part of air transportation at every airport in the United States of America. This issue is something that has been considered in the House of Representatives as part of the transportation package as well, and it is part of what we think should be in this package in the Senate; that is, making sure that those who are part of the delivery system--ticket counter agents, agents who are aiding and assisting in getting passengers through the terminals and onto planes at the gate, assisting, as many of the challenging days go by, in delivering good air transportation service. What has happened is that these individuals have become victims--the victims of physical, violent abuse; that is, the public has taken to bodily harm against these individuals. So this amendment puts in similar safeguards [[Page S1789]] that are in line with other transportation officials who are protected from this kind of physical abuse. I will have more to say on it, but I know my colleague is trying to get to the floor to speak as well. I will put into the Record examples of individuals who are ticketing agents, baggage agents, air transportation delivery system workers who have been hurt, and they deserve to have protection. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3483 Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge a ``yes'' vote on the upcoming amendment to require the FAA to set a minimum standard seat size. This amendment would ensure that airlines can't keep chopping down on seat size and legroom until consumers are packed in like sardines in a can on every flight. Over the last few decades, between the size of the seat and the distance between the seats, the flying public has lost half a foot of their space. Flying is not pleasant anymore. You are crammed in. I am not that tall--a little under 6-foot-1. What I do when I fly is I take out the magazine and the air-sickness bag and the little folder that shows you where the exits are to gain one-sixteenth of an inch more legroom. Moms with kids have a lot of trouble in those very narrow seats. Have you ever been in the situation where you are in the middle and there are two sort of large people on either side of you? It is not the most pleasant flying experience. We don't have too much competition anymore. We have very few airlines. This is a place where the public is clamoring for change. When I said I was going to offer this amendment, I got more feedback on it than most other things. And you don't have to be 6-foot-4 to understand the problem. You would think that by cramming in more and more passengers on each flight, the airlines could lower their prices. Instead, several major airlines went in the other direction: They started charging for the extra inches and legroom that were once considered standard. So it practically costs you an arm and a leg just to have space for your arms and legs. At a time when airlines are making record profits, at a time when fuel costs are extremely low, we need this amendment to protect consumers' safety and comfort. This amendment would do three things. It doesn't set a standard seat size; it freezes the current seat size in place so they can't shrink it any further. It directs the FAA to set minimum standard seat size and pitch for all commercial flights. And some of this involves comfort, but some of it involves safety. God forbid there is something terrible happening on a plane--the seats are so narrow, it is harder for people to get out. Finally, we focus on transparency. We require airlines to post their seat sizes on their Web sites, providing at least a commercial incentive for airlines to offer more comfortable seat arrangements. Most folks travel under the expectation that the airlines are going to set the guidelines and that is that; there is nothing they can do about it. We actually had to put in the underlying bill that airlines should refund bag fees charged to consumers if the airline lost their bags. And I would say to my good friends on the other side, if we can mandate that bag fees be returned--not leave it up to the free market-- we can mandate that the FAA at least set a proper seat size. They can't say: Well, leave it up to the free market on one but not on the other. It is not a little fair. Now we see why we need these amendments. The bag fee--and I agree that if they lose your bags or delay your bags, they shouldn't keep the extra bag fee. It should be refunded. In most industries, that would be a standard practice. If you fail to deliver a service somebody paid for, they should get their money back. But sometimes in the airline industry you have to require basic courtesy. In conclusion, the great Abraham Lincoln was once asked how long a man's legs should be, and he famously answered: Long enough to reach from the body to the ground. If you asked a major airline today how long a man's legs should be, they would say: Short enough to miss the tray table. That is no way to fly. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and move this bill in a more consumer-friendly direction. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have to catch planes, and it takes extra time for them to squeeze into those small seats with no legroom. So I yield back my time, and I ask unanimous consent that we move the vote up to right now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3483. Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. THUNE. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cornyn) would have voted ``nay.'' Mr. REID.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass the legislation we passed here in the Senate a few weeks ago called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. We passed it on March 10, which was 27 days ago--almost a month. It is estimated that we lose about 120 Americans every day to drug overdoses. That means that during that time period--those 27 days--we lost about 3,240 additional Americans who we represent to substance abuse and death from heroin and prescription drug overdoses. Since 2007, drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than any other cause of accidental death, even surpassing car accidents. It is probably [[Page S1790]] true nationally now as well. Addiction is treatable, but 9 out of 10 people who need treatment aren't getting it. That is a tragedy. It shows that the system we have right now just isn't working, and that is what our legislation addresses, among other things. In one 5-day span since we passed CARA, just in the last month, we had five people die from heroin and Fentanyl overdoses in one of the cities I represent-- Cleveland, OH. I was in Athens, OH, more than 2 weeks after we passed CARA, and received a tour of the Rural Women's Addiction Recovery Bassett House facility. Dr. Joe Gay and Ruth Tarter took me around so I could meet some of the brave women who stepped forward to treat their addiction issues. Some of them were there with their kids. They have an amazing success rate. I will tell you that 3 days after I left Athens, OH, $40,000 of heroin was seized at a traffic stop very close to this treatment facility. It is everywhere. It knows no ZIP code. It is in rural areas, suburban areas, and inner cities. States are starting to take action. Ohio is taking action, your States are taking action, and communities are taking action. Local leaders know this is a problem, but they want the Federal Government to be a better partner. That is what CARA provides. It provides best practices from around the country. It provides more funding for some critical elements that are evidence- based--based on research and what actually works. Our States and local communities are desperate for this right now. By the way, this legislation is not just bipartisan. It is also bicameral. In other words, not only have Republicans and Democrats worked across the aisle here in the Senate over the last 3 years putting this bill together, but our colleagues in the House have worked together as well. I am encouraged by the fact that the CARA legislation in the House has 113 cosponsors. It is bipartisan. It is based on good evidence. It is based on a lot of work and effort. Today I heard through a media account that one of the House leaders said there is interest in moving something even this month. That is great. But he also talked about hearings and markups and so on. Let's be sure the hearings and markups don't delay what we know we should do, which is to pass the CARA legislation. It has been bicameral and bipartisan. It passed the Senate with a 94-to-1 vote. That never happens around here-- 94 to 1. This is legislation which we know will make a difference right now in our communities that are dealing with a crisis we all face. Let's move this legislation. I say to my friends in the House with all due respect, this legislation has been carefully crafted and we have done the hard work. I mentioned that we spent 3 years of factfinding on this bill. We didn't think we had all the right answers, so we went out to experts all over the country. We took time to listen. We consulted with them. We listened to experts, doctors, law enforcement, and patients in recovery. We listened to the drug experts in the Obama administration, such as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP. They have been very helpful. We brought in people from Health and Human Services and listened to them. We brought in people from my home State of Ohio and other States around the country. We heard from family members, many of whom have channelled their grief at losing a loved one into advocacy for the CARA legislation because they know it is going to help. One testified in the Judiciary Committee when we marked up the legislation. Tonda DaRe from Carrollton, OH, talked about having lost her daughter, who was a very successful high school student and engaged to be married. Everything was going great. When she turned 21, she made a mistake: She tried heroin. She went into recovery. She relapsed. She ended up dying of an overdose. Unfortunately, this is a story that is retold all over our country. There are moms, there are dads, there are aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters who come forward to tell us these tragic stories about losing a loved one. They want this legislation to pass because they know it is going to help another family member or a friend or a coworker or someone whom they have never met but whom they want to help so they don't have to go through the grief they have gone through. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse--a Democrat--and I have worked on this legislation together, along with many other people in this Chamber. We have also worked, as I said, with many on the House side. We worked with folks on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol because this has become an issue that affects us all. It is a nonpartisan issue. We have to move it forward. We held five forums here in Washington, DC, and brought in experts to get counsel and advice. They helped us develop a legislative proposal that was thoughtful because it actually addressed the real problem. In April 2014, we had a forum on the criminal justice system which included alternatives to incarceration, and you will see that in our legislation. The notion is, for users who get arrested for possession, let's not just throw them in jail because that hasn't worked. Let's get them into treatment and get them into a recovery program that works. In July 2014, we held a forum on how women are impacted by this drug epidemic, looking particularly at addiction and treatment responses. Some new data that is out there now shows that most of the people who are suffering from heroin and prescription drug addiction are women. In December 2014, we held a forum on the science of addiction--how we could get at this from a medical point of view, how we could come up with better medical approaches to this to be able to stop the craving, to deal with the addiction problem, to get people through withdrawal. We also talked about how to address some of the collateral consequences of addiction. In April of 2015, we held a forum on our youth and how we can better promote drug prevention. After all, keeping people from getting into the funnel of addiction in the first place has to be a priority. To help people avoid going down that funnel of addiction, we need better prevention, better education. That is part of our legislation. We also had input about what is working in recovery and what is not working in recovery. We held a forum in July of 2015 to talk about our veterans, to talk about the very sad situation with veterans who are coming back to our shores who have PTSD--post-traumatic stress disorder--and who have brain injuries. Some recent data shows that about 20 percent of returning veterans with those issues are becoming addicted to prescription drugs or heroin; therefore, veterans courts are a major part of our legislation. These are drug courts that are focused on mental health and addiction specifically for our veterans. I have seen them in Ohio. They are working great. It is unbelievable. I talked to a guy who has been in and out of the system his whole life. He is about 45 years old now. He finally found this court that was going to help him--took him out of jail and got him into treatment. Hanging over his head was the possibility of incarceration if he didn't do the right thing and stay clean. He is now a senior at Ohio State University and is about to get his degree, and he reunited with his family for the first time in many years. He is clean. It can work. The final result was the legislative text that reflected this open and deliberative process I am talking about. This bill--just like the research it supports--is evidence-based. We didn't ask who had the idea; we just asked whether it was a good idea. It is no wonder that CARA now has support from 130 national groups, from the Fraternal Order of Police, to stakeholders in public health-- doctors and nurses, those in recovery, experts in the field, people who actually know what is going on because they are in the trenches working on this. They want this bill passed. They know it will help them and help them now. As I said, that vote was 94 to 1, which means 94 Senators say this bill is ready to go. These are Senators from every State in the Union who support this legislation, therefore representing every congressional district in the United States of America. It makes sense. It expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent opiate abuse, the use of heroin and prescription drugs. It increases drug-disposal sites to get medications out of people's hands and get it into the right hands. It takes [[Page S1791]] this medication off the bathroom shelves. It has a drug-monitoring program to get at the overprescribing issue. So many people who are currently addicted to heroin started with prescription drugs. In fact, the majority did. There is different data out there, but it is very clear that prescription drugs are a huge part of heroin addiction. It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and meth. Law enforcement has an important role to play here. It expands training and the availability of naloxone, or Narcan, to law enforcement. This is for our firefighters. When you go to a firehouse in your State--for those listening in the House, in your district--ask them: Are you going on more fire runs or are you going on more runs to help people with overdoses? They will tell you what they tell me: overdoses. That is what it has come to. That is happening in your fire department in your community. By the way, to tell you how much this law can make a difference-- because we do help get the training for them to be able to use Narcan and get the Narcan or naloxone into the right hands--Ohio public safety officials have administered naloxone over 16,000 times since 2015-- 16,000 overdoses that might otherwise have resulted in death. For the most part, this miracle drug works. First responders know how important it is. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police supports this bill. They want to equip their officers, but so do the firefighters. CARA also supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. To avoid people getting into addiction in the first place, it also creates a national task force on recovery because there is a lot of information out there we need to bring together to find out what works and what doesn't work precisely in terms of dealing with the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. CARA expands treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies who suffer from what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. What does that mean? That means babies who are born addicted. In Ohio, tragically, we had a 750-percent increase in the number of babies born with addiction in the last 12 years. I have been to the hospitals. I have been to St. Rita's in Lima. I have been to Rainbow Babies in Cleveland. I have been to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. I have seen these babies. These are tiny babies who are addicted, and they have to be taken through withdrawal. The compassionate nurses and doctors who are doing it--God bless them--I asked them: What is going to happen to these babies? They told me: Rob, we don't know. We don't know the long-term consequences because it is so new. But it is dramatic and it is happening in all of your hospitals. These neonatal units are now taking on a whole other task, which is helping babies through withdrawal. I visited folks who are not only pregnant but are addicted, and I talked to them about what they are going through and what the consequences are going to be, and it is sad. Many say: Rob, the grip of addiction is so great. I am now in treatment, but I worry about what is going to happen to my baby. We also expand treatment for expectant and postpartum women for that reason. And these expectant and postpartum women who need this help can make the right decision with more help from us. It expands residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction. It creates a pilot program to provide family-based services to women who are addicted to opiates. CARA also helps veterans, as I said. It allows those veterans to get into a veterans court, where they can get help to walk through how they get out of this addiction, how they get into recovery. They can get support from other veterans around them to provide the kind of help they need to get out of this cycle of incarceration and addiction. What do we say to the 40 million Americans who are struggling with addiction when they ask ``Why don't you guys act?'' The Senate acted 94 to 1. Why can't we get this done? It is time to move. They shouldn't have to wait. We shouldn't have to wait. To those 40 million who struggle, to those who think they can't overcome this addiction, to those who believe there is no one out there to help them, the message is, you are not alone. There is hope. You can beat this. I have seen it. There are people who care and want to help. There are so many heartbreaking stories of addiction, but there are also so many stories of hope. I think about Vanessa Perkins from Nelsonville, OH. Vanessa became addicted to heroin. Once she became addicted, she also became a victim of sex trafficking. Those two are related. In Ohio, they tell me that most sex trafficking has now to do with heroin addiction. In other words, the trafficker gets these women--usually women--addicted to heroin, and that is one way they become dependent on their trafficker. What Vanessa tells me is that it took her a long time to turn her life around, but she was courageous and brave enough to seek treatment, and she is now back on track. For the last 6 years she has been helping others, taking her experience and using it to help others deal with their addiction. She is on the board of a group called Freedom a la Cart, which is a company in Columbus, OH, that I visited last month that provides job opportunities for trafficking victims. They do a heck of a job and teach these women a trade, too--culinary arts. Now so many of these women who had been trafficked, who had been heroin addicts, are back on their feet, reunited with their families, and know the dignity and self-respect that come from the work they are doing and from helping others. There is hope. Treatment can work. Mr. President, leaders in the House say they want to move anti-heroin legislation through regular order. Again, I heard today that one of the leaders said they are planning to take action. I had conversations with Speaker Ryan on this issue. I had conversations with other leaders in the House on it. I take them at their word. I am hopeful we will see the House begin to act next week when that Chamber returns, but I will say this: The House must act, and they must act soon. I am not going to be patient on this. This is urgent, and people's lives are at stake. The House must pass this bill so the President can sign it and so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives of the people we represent. This is our responsibility. We need to take advantage of this opportunity that the Senate has given us by this huge vote--94 to 1--to get this legislation to the President and get it enacted into law. Mr. President, I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. FLINT, MICHIGAN, WATER CRISIS Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I would like to speak about two different subjects. Both are connected in the sense that they involve lack of action and people counting on us to act as a Senate. The first involves the fact that today in the city of Flint, MI, we still have people who can't drink the water coming out of the tap. I think any one of us would have trouble if that happened for 1 day, but we are talking about months and months--going on 2 years now--that we have seen a system completely broken down because of decisions, because of lack of treating the water, a whole range of things. From my perspective, the most important thing is the fact that people still don't have access to clean, safe water. They can't bathe their babies. They can't take a shower themselves. I can't imagine what it must be like for families in Flint who are waiting and waiting for help. I want to thank President Obama for doing what he can do through the administration to help from the standpoint of health and nutrition and education, but the fundamental problem is replacing the damaged pipes. As my colleagues know, we have been working very hard and we have developed a bipartisan proposal. I wish to thank the chair and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell, for working with us, and so many colleagues who are now bipartisan cosponsors on a bill with myself and Senator Peters. I wish to thank Senator Inhofe as chair of EPW and ranking member Senator Boxer and so many people who have [[Page S1792]] come together to support this effort, not only for Flint, but we now are seeing headlines across the country about other areas where lead poisoning in water is a serious issue and where we have all kinds of communities with water infrastructure needs. We have put together a proposal. We have a bipartisan proposal. We are ready to move forward. We need a vote on this proposal. As people in this building know, the junior Senator from Utah is holding us up from being able to get that vote. We have spent weeks now--weeks-- trying to find a way to get beyond this objection. We thought we had an agreement, and then the bar just keeps changing. This is not a game. These are real people, and we are trying to solve a real problem. We have put forward a proposal fully paid for that actually reduces the deficit, paid for out of a program that I care deeply about because I authored it in 2007, and prior to Senator Peters being a Senator, when he was in the House, he was the champion of the program that we are offering to use as a payfor. So I just want to remind everyone--and I am going to continue to come to the floor and remind colleagues every day--that a group of Americans in a city of 100,000 where there has been a Federal emergency declared are still waiting for us to act to help them--not to do the whole thing, not to pay for all of what needs to be done in terms of water infrastructure, but to do our part as a Federal Government, as we have done in communities across the country for other kinds of emergencies. We need to help the children of Flint. Nine thousand children under the age of six are being exposed to lead poisoning; some homes have exposure higher than a toxic waste dump. I can tell my colleagues as a mother and now as a grandmother, I would never tolerate something like that. I can't imagine what is happening for families. We have the opportunity to do something. It is easy. It is fully paid for. It is fully paid for by something that colleagues on the other side of the aisle have wanted to eliminate--fully paid for. It helps communities across the country. Now we have a situation where one Member has indicated, well, it is not his problem. He doesn't care; it is not his problem. I hope as Americans we are willing to say that other people's problems--I would think we care about them, whether it is our own children, our own grandchildren, people we know or not. That is what we expect when there are emergencies and disasters across the country. And whether it is in the farm bill that I worked on with the distinguished Presiding Officer where we strengthened livestock disaster assistance-- even though that is not a huge issue to me in the State of Michigan, but I know it is for a lot of States and a lot of communities. That is what we do as Americans. We care about people and communities. We have a group of people right now who are not being seen. I want my colleagues to see this baby and the picture this represents of a group of people who are waiting for help and deserve help. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. President, I wish to address something else now and turn to history to talk about somebody else who is waiting. He can drink his water and take a shower. That is a good thing. But we have a very distinguished jurist, the Chief Judge of the DC Court of Appeals, nominated by the President of the United States to be a Supreme Court Justice, who is waiting for the opportunity to be heard, to have a hearing, to meet with people, to have a vote, yes or no. We have spoken a lot about the Constitution, about responsibilities, about debates. Our three branches of government are sworn to uphold both the written word of the Constitution and the spirit of the Constitution. This spirit was expressed in a series of articles beginning in 1787. I wasn't there at the time. But in reading what our Founding Fathers said--those who framed the Constitution--I think it is important to look at what they intended through the Federalist Papers. On April 1, 1788, Alexander Hamilton, writing in Federalist Paper No. 76, outlined two specific roles for Supreme Court nominees: that the President nominate Justices and the Senate provide advice and consent. Hamilton explained how the Senate held the power to reject a nominee, to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from family connection, from personal attachment, or from other biases. As my colleagues know, Senators can investigate the character of a nominee by meeting the nominee in person, by holding hearings, and by looking at their writings. At the Senate Judiciary Committee they can ask the nominee questions in full view of the public. Based on responses, if they believe a nominee does not have the appropriate character, they can reject the nomination. They can vote no. That is our right as Senators. But Senators in the current Republican majority are refusing to do any of that. They have said they will not hold hearings. Most of them will not even meet with the nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. I want to commend Republican Senators who are, in fact, meeting with Judge Garland. This is their job. This is our job--the job established for us by America's Founding Fathers--and a majority of the majority is refusing to do it. Now, according to the average time for moving a Supreme Court nominee through the process, if the Republican majority did their job, as previous Senates did, then there would be a hearing of the Judiciary Committee by April 27, but there is none scheduled. The Judiciary Committee would hold a vote by May 12, but there is no vote coming. And based on historical precedent, the Supreme Court nominee would then come to the floor for a vote on confirmation before Memorial Day. But because my colleagues across the aisle are refusing to do their job, that vote will not happen. My Republican colleagues like to say that the Senate does not confirm Supreme Court nominees during a Presidential year, but that doesn't square with the facts. More than a dozen Supreme Court nominees have been confirmed by the Senate in an election year. In 1988, also a Presidential year, the Senate did its job by confirming President Reagan's Supreme Court nominee, Justice Anthony Kennedy, with a Democratically controlled Senate. In 1940, another Presidential election year, the Senate did its job by confirming President Franklin Roosevelt's nominee, Justice Frank Murphy. In 1932, the Senate did its job by confirming President Hoover's Supreme Court nominee. In 1916, the Senate did its job twice by confirming President Wilson's two nominees for the Supreme Court. The U.S. Constitution was ratified in June 1788, just a few months after Hamilton published the Federalist Paper I mentioned a few minutes ago. And for nearly 228 years--228 years--during times of war, times of peace, periods of prosperity, and periods of economic hardship, America has balanced the powers between the executive and the legislative branches in selecting who would serve in the third branch of government. We have done it during Democratic majorities and Republican majorities for 228 years. To those who are refusing to hold hearings on a nomination, my question is this: What has changed? What has changed this year? What is it about this President that causes him to be treated this way? What is it that is leading my colleagues to question the judgment and the wisdom of Alexander Hamilton and the rest of the Founding Fathers who signed the Constitution and gave us the responsibility for advice and consent? In short, why now are you refusing to do your job? Just do your job. Do what we are paid to do. Last month, I went over in front of the Supreme Court on a beautiful, sunny day when a lot of people were here visiting, and I talked to a number of citizens and asked them what they thought about what was happening, the debate going on about filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. I also asked them what would happen to you if during a year you told your employer that a major part of your job--a very big responsibility that you have in your job--you were going to refuse to do for a year or so. What would happen? Well, the answer is pretty easy. People said: I would be fired. People say: Why aren't you doing your job? Why isn't the majority doing its job? Because if you are not willing to do the work, why should you have the job? Nobody else can do that in their job. [[Page S1793]] That is why the polls show overwhelmingly that the American people side with those of us on the Democratic side, with all of us who stand together as Democratic Senators to say: Do your job. We are willing to do our job. People stand with the Constitution and with the overwhelming history of our country. It is very simple. It is a very simple idea. It is a phrase we say all the time in all kinds of circumstances. We say to our children, we say to people we work with: Just do your job. Well, this is our job. Hold a hearing, meet with the nominee, have a vote. You can vote yes; you can vote no. You could skip that day. But this judge deserves a vote, and it is our responsibility to vote and to fill the vacancy on the highest Court in the land. That is what the American people expect us to do. That is what they deserve. It is time that the Senate do its job. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss several provisions in an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill that is currently before the Senate and that specifically benefits my home State of Louisiana. There are more than 253 air traffic control towers throughout the country operating through a successful public-private partnership called the Federal Contract Tower Program. This program is especially critical to rural areas--as I have in Louisiana and as does the Presiding Officer--to ensure that America's airspace and the traveling public are safe. However, there are currently 30 towers awaiting the FAA to finalize an internal agency formula called the benefit-cost analysis, referred to as the BCA, which will allow eligible towers to enter the Federal Contract Tower Program. One of these airports is the Hammond Northshore Regional Airport in Hammond, LA. The Federal Contract Tower Program has been in place for more than 30 years and is a prime example of an effective public-private partnership between government and the private sector. Contract towers handle approximately 28 percent of the Nation's air traffic control tower operations but account for only 14 percent of the FAA's total tower operations budget. Repeated studies by the U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general have shown that the Contract Tower Program increases aviation safety while reducing costs to taxpayers and the Federal Government. It is also important to note that approximately 80 percent of the contract controller workforce are veterans. Congress has demonstrated numerous times in bipartisan fashion the merit and need for the Federal Contract Tower Program. Given the success of the program and the increasing likelihood of further FAA delays, I am pleased the Commerce Committee included language in the FAA reauthorization bill to strengthen and improve the Federal Contract Tower Program. Senators Cornyn, Vitter, Portman, and Wicker have been leaders on this issue, and their work is greatly appreciated. Currently, America's trade and economy are being hampered because many cargo planes from other countries are prohibited from flying into U.S. airports because they have not been upgraded to newer types of technology. Some aircraft are what is called ``Stage 2 aircraft.'' These aircraft were phased out following the passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, which mandated the phaseout for Stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds. I have introduced an amendment that would permit flights to a small number of airports under limited circumstances for revenue and nonrevenue flights of Stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds. One of the airports that meets the criteria is the Acadiana Regional Airport in New Iberia, LA. This airport is located in a heavy industrial complex and surrounded by agricultural land. The Acadiana Regional Airport has an advantage over other types of airports because it is surrounded by land use compatible with airport operations. Additionally, it is situated near the Port of Iberia, which is home to more than 100 companies employing close to 5,000 people in industries such as construction, energy, equipment rental, and trucking. This would bolster Louisiana's economy, help working families, and improve America's ability to trade with the world. Louisiana's economy relies on the thriving maritime industry. In 2014 a study from the Transportation Institute showed that 54,850 maritime- related jobs contribute more than $11 billion annually to Louisiana's economy. One in every 83 Louisiana jobs is connected to the domestic maritime industry, nearly twice that of any other State. With ports along the Mississippi and Red Rivers, our State sees vessels of varying sizes and types. While loading cargo, these ships must drain ballast water that they have taken on to maintain the balance of the ship. This can have varying degrees of environmental effects, with costly and confusing State and Federal regulations making compliance difficult. Senator Rubio is sponsoring the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, which creates a uniform, enforceable, and scientifically based national standard on ballast water discharges. This is needed in order to simplify the highly complicated and overly burdensome patchwork of State and Federal regulations that are in place today. Everyone I talk to in Louisiana's maritime industry and also in the inland marine, which would take the agriculture products from States such as the State the Presiding Officer represents, says it is necessary for these regulations to be harmonized, and they emphasize the importance of passing this bill. I am a cosponsor of this bill, and I am glad to see that Senator Rubio has filed the amendment to the bill we are considering on the floor today. The FAA Reauthorization Act contains many measures that will protect Americans, improve our economy, and protect our environment. I urge all my fellow Senators to support the bill and these amendments. I yield the floor. Amendment No. 3512, as Modified Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Aviation safety, as much as all national security, must be of paramount importance. I am increasingly concerned with reports from across the country that Secure Identification Display Area, SIDA, badges have gone missing, either through loss or theft. These badges, which grant access to secure areas of airports, allow employees to bypass traditional security checkpoints and, in the wrong hands, can pose a considerable security threat. An amendment considered and adopted earlier today by the Senate, Thune amendment No. 3512, is aimed at addressing this problem and would implement additional accountability and oversight methods to ensure that these SIDA badges do not fall into the wrong hands. It would provide for further employer accountability and allow for increased fines and enforcement actions against workers that fail to report the loss or theft of a badge. These are well-intentioned goals and ones that I support. I opposed this amendment, however, because extraneous provisions included in the amendment directly contradict bipartisan efforts in this Congress to reform our criminal justice system, including by reducing unnecessary barriers to employment for people with criminal records. The amendment will require the TSA Administrator to propose increasing the lookback period from 10 years to 15 years for background checks of airport and airline workers who have or are seeking SIDA badges. Under current regulations, there are a number of offenses that disqualify a potential employee, if the individual was convicted of the offense during the 10-year lookback period. The amendment would also require the TSA Administrator to consider adding more offenses to the list of disqualifying crimes. Disqualifying offenses already include a number of low-level offenses, such as felony drug possession. These provisions would exacerbate barriers to reentry. The scope of the changes will still exclude many potential employees and lead to the firing of a number of current employees. [[Page S1794]] I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks a letter from Transport Workers Union of America, the AFL-CIO, the Association of Flight Attendants, CWA--the Communication Workers of America, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Transportation Trades Department--AFL-CIO, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Employment Law Project in opposition to this amendment. I am committed to working with Senator Thune to ensure greater accountability for Secure Identification Display Area badges. It must be a priority. I hope that he and others will work with me through the conference of this bill to eliminate these barriers to employment for individuals with certain criminal records. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: April 6, 2016. Oppose the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361) as an Amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act (H.R. 636) Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to oppose any efforts to expand background checks on aviation workers as proposed in the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361). In particular, we are opposed to the inclusion of S. 2361 as an amendment to H.R. 636, the FAA Reauthorization Act, which is currently under consideration in the Senate. As drafted, S. 2361 would undermine reforms around the nation that have reduced barriers to employment of people with criminal records, thus representing a serious setback for the bipartisan criminal justice reform movement. The Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act would alter the requirements for airport workers to obtain Secure Identification Display Area (SIDA) badges by instructing the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator to propose increasing the lookback period on many aviation workers' employment background checks from 10 years to 15 years. This provision undermines the goal of promoting rehabilitation, and it conflicts with the substantial research documenting that criminal history lookback periods should not extend back more than seven years. The bill also instructs the TSA Administrator to consider increasing disqualifying criminal offenses to include crimes that do not appear to be related to transportation security. These reforms would have far reaching impact and exacerbate barriers to reentry. As many as one in three Americans have a criminal record and nearly half of U.S. children have a parent with a criminal record, creating life-long barriers to opportunity, including employment, for entire families. This change will also have an overwhelming discriminatory impact on communities of color, who have been hardest hit by a flawed criminal justice system. Moreover, this proposal does not account for the compelling evidence documenting the impact of gainful employment on those who have previously been convicted of a crime. Full integration into society is essential to successful anti-terror programs and efforts to lower recidivism rates. By requiring the dismissal of many current employees who have worked in a position for years, the legislation ignores these widely accepted principles. We do support some elements of this legislation. The bill would create a waiver process for those who are denied credentials. This would ensure the consideration of circumstances from which it may be concluded that an individual does not pose a risk of terrorism or to security. The waiver process would consider the circumstances surrounding an offense, restitution, mitigation remedies, and other factors. This provision is modeled on a very successful program in the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), a credential that is similar to a SIDA, which is used at secure areas of port facilities. We strongly encourage you oppose the inclusion of any amendment providing blanket categorical exclusions that would increase background checks on aviation workers and act as additional barriers to the employment of people with criminal records. Thank you for your consideration.

Mr. President, I was absent from today's votes on three amendments to the pending business, H.R. 636, the vehicle for a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, due to events I attended with President Obama in Illinois. Had I been present, my votes would have been as follows. On rollcall vote No. 41, Thune amendment No. 3512, as modified, I would have voted against adoption. I am concerned about the impact that a provision in this amendment will have on formerly incarcerated individuals who have successfully reintegrated into society after completing sentences for low-level crimes unrelated to transportation security. The provision, which will make it more difficult for these individuals to obtain certain aviation jobs years after a criminal conviction, undermines efforts to reduce barriers to reentry, lower recidivism rates, and reform our criminal justice system. On rollcall vote No. 42, Heinrich amendment No. 3482, as modified, I would have voted in favor of adoption. This amendment will further strengthen the homeland by increasing security in soft targets at airports, in areas like check-ins and baggage claims, where terrorists recently carried out deadly attacks in Brussels. The amendment will expand and enhance visible deterrents, create a new eligible use under Homeland Security grants for training exercises to enhance preparedness for active shooter incidents, and authorize and make explicit that Homeland Security grants can be used for airport and surface transportation in these nonsecure soft target areas. I am proud to have cosponsored this amendment. On rollcall vote No. 43, Schumer amendment No. 3483, I would have voted in favor of adoption. This amendment would establish consumer safeguards like minimum standards for space for passengers on aircrafts, including the size and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room, and the width of aisles. As these votes demonstrate, after a series of temporary extensions, the Senate is finally considering a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. In light of recent threats both here and abroad, it is important that we get this right. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis on these important security reforms, consumer protections, and other pressing aviation-related issues in the coming days and weeks. Mr. CASSIDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so ordered. UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, April 11, at 5 p.m., the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 215; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1778-S1794] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 636, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 636) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. Pending: Thune/Nelson amendment No. 3464, in the nature of a substitute. Thune (for Gardner) amendment No. 3460 (to amendment No. 3464), to require the FAA Administrator to consider the operational history of a person before authorizing the person to operate certain unmanned aircraft systems. Thune amendment No. 3512 (to amendment No. 3464), to enhance airport security. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have the FAA bill on the floor. I would like to discuss some of the amendments that are proposed and, hopefully, a couple that we will be voting on this morning. There are a couple of amendments--one offered by Senator Thune on behalf of himself and this Senator, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, and another offered by Senator Heinrich. Both amendments deal with the issue of security but in different arenas. Let me explain. The Thune-Nelson amendment applies to the question of perimeter security, of allowing employees to get into an airport--not the sterile area controlled by TSA, although, as I will explain, it can definitely affect the sterile area as well. On the other hand, the Heinrich amendment addresses security in the areas where passengers bunch up outside of TSA security, such as in a queue-up line going through TSA security, or passengers bunched up at the ticket counters, checking in their luggage. Either way, as we saw from the experience of the Brussels airport explosion, those are very tempting targets for a terrorist. Therefore, the proposal in the Heinrich amendment, which I would commend to the Senate, is to increase the level of security, particularly with what are called VIPR teams, which, in essence, are not only at airports but at seaports and at transportation hubs. Remember that in Brussels there was a bombing in one of the train stations as well. So we need to increase the surveillance and the security there, including dogs. As a matter of fact, our K-9 friends are some of the best that we have when it comes to protecting us because their noses are attuned to being able to sniff out the explosives that you cannot detect with metal detectors or with the AIT machine that we go through where we hold up our hands to see if we have anything on us. It can detect if you have a package, if you have an explosive that is somewhere in one of your body cavities. It is going to be very, very difficult. Dogs, because of their God-given sense of smell, can detect that. A properly trained dog is just amazing to watch. Now, interestingly, concurrently there is research going on at NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, for an artificial dog nose, a mechanical item or a piece of software and hardware that would actually do the same job. But that has not been perfected yet. That is going to be really interesting to see what they come up with. This Senator will report to the Senate later on that. But for the time being, the Heinrich amendment, which I hope we will vote on this morning, is concerned with that security that we have seen as a result of the Brussels bombing. We certainly want to enhance security in our airports. Thank goodness we have the intelligence apparatus that we do in this country to be able to smoke out the terrorist before he ever does his dirty deed. It is more difficult for them to do it here in America than it is in Europe because of the alienation of those communities that then harbor the terrorists. We see the result in Brussels as well as Paris. That is the Heinrich amendment. That is a broad characterization of it, but basically that is the thrust. The Thune-Nelson amendment is going at the perimeter security. OK, think Egypt and the Russian airliner. It was an airport employee who smuggled the bomb onto the plane, not as a passenger but as an airport employee. Think the Atlanta airport, 2 years ago. In a gunrunning scheme over 3 months, over 100 guns were transported from Atlanta to New York. The police in New York could not figure out how all of these guns were getting on the streets in New York. They kept checking the trains, and they kept checking the interstates. They could not figure it out. Here is how they did it. An employee at the Atlanta airport--because Atlanta was not checking their employees--would smuggle the guns in. Then that employee had access in the terminal to get into the sterile area--the TSA sterile area--and he would go into the men's room, meet the passenger who had already come through security and was clean, and give the guns to him to put them in his empty knapsack, his backpack. This employee, over the course of 17 times, over 3 months, smuggled over 100 guns. Thank goodness it was a criminal enterprise, not a terrorist, because you can imagine what would have happened. The Miami International Airport 10 years ago figured this out. What they did was, instead of having hundreds of entry points into the airport for airport employees in a very large airport like Atlanta, in Miami they boiled it down to a handful. There the employees went through similar security that passengers do to check to see if they had any weapons. They had a special identification card that they would have to stick into an electronic machine and put in their code, which was another way of checking to make sure that the employee was who they said they were. Miami solved the problem after having a problem with drugs 10 years ago. Interestingly, in the interim, the Orlando International Airport, likewise, about 4 years ago had a similar drug problem. They did the same thing. They boiled down hundreds of entry points for airport employees to a handful. They had those checks. I have gone to see those checks at those two airports. That is exactly how they do it. The fact is, we have 300 airports in the United States. There were only two that were doing this kind of perimeter checking. Atlanta then became the [[Page S1779]] poster boy of what can happen in a gunrunning scheme. I am happy to report to the Senate that, in fact, the Atlanta airport has now done exactly what Miami and Orlando have done. But we have 297 other airports that need to do the same thing. So the Thune-Nelson amendment is exactly getting at that kind of perimeter security situation. I highly commend both the Thune-Nelson amendment as well as the Heinrich amendment. There are a whole bunch of cosponsors--bipartisan--on each of these. I highly recommend both of these to the Senate. I hope we will vote on those today--hopefully, this morning. Now, there are going to be, of course, a series of many other amendments, some very well intentioned that have some technical glitches, and we have our very expert staff right now starting to try to work out some of these technical glitches. Then we can get moving with this FAA bill. I would mention one other amendment that this Senator will be offering, and that is on a cyber security bill. Did the Presiding Officer see the ``60 Minutes'' segment where people with a laptop could take over an automobile by going through the electronics of the automobile? They can speed it up, they can make it stop it, and they can make it turn and completely take over the operation of an automobile. Can the Presiding Officer imagine somebody being able to do that with an airliner with 250 people on board? Therefore, whether we want to face it or not, we better face it because we are in an era that what we need to do is to make sure technically that the systems in an airliner are separate, that there is an air gap, and that whatever those systems are--it might be Wi-Fi for the airplane, it might be music, or it may be whatever it is--there is an air gap so that someone cannot go into that system and suddenly get into the aircraft controls. That is super important. One other thing I would mention is what we know as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. They have become quite popular. But, obviously, one of the things that is already in the bill, which Senator Thune and I have insisted on as we approach this FAA bill, is that we have to come face-to-face with the reality that drones are now impairing the safety of an ascending or a descending aircraft. We have seen--the two of us--an operation where you can now take over the operation of a drone. Education can do so much. People have to understand that you basically have to not fly a drone within 5 miles of an airport. Just recently, at Miami International Airport, there was an inbound American Airlines plane, and there was a drone about 1,000 feet off on the left side. Remember Captain Sully Sullenberger, when a flock of geese suddenly got sucked into the engines and all power was lost. Fortunately, he had the Hudson River that he could belly it in after he had taken off from LaGuardia. You put a drone with plastic and metal, let that get sucked into the engine, and you will have a catastrophic failure. You don't want to put your passengers in that kind of operation. Therefore, education is one thing, but there is always going to be a young person that does not know about this. We don't know the answer. We know we can take over the operation of the drone, send it over here, have it set down, and have it land. The technology is there, but how do we apply that technology so we avoid this aircraft collision? There is an increasing use of drones that are so helpful for so many commercial purposes, not to mention the pure pleasure of flying a drone around, which we are seeing has become exceptionally popular. We address that in the bill by giving the appropriate direction to the FAA to start coming up with the solutions of how we are going to protect aircraft in and around airports. On down the line, there are going to be so many different issues with regard to drones, far beyond the scope of the FAA bill. On the question of privacy--a drone suddenly coming down and coming at eye level outside your bedroom window snooping--there are all kinds of questions about privacy. What about the fact that you can now put a gun on a drone? We know in a war zone we have the capability of doing that with very sophisticated weapons, such as Hellfire missiles, but now some people are experimenting with putting a gun on a drone. We have the ramifications of what that means for society to deal with in the future. For the immediate future, the FAA bill on the floor--we have this problem of avoiding drones colliding into aircraft, and that is in the bill and it is addressed. We have a lot of interesting issues to talk about. Let's get the Senate on it, and hopefully we can get agreement so we can at least vote on two of these amendments this morning. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3482, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3464 Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3482, as modified, and ask that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Heinrich] proposes an amendment numbered 3482, as modified, to amendment No. 3464. The amendment, as modified, is as follows: (Purpose: To expand and enhance visible deterrents at major transportation hubs and to increase the resources to protect and secure the United States) At the end of title V, insert the following: SEC. 5032. VISIBLE DETERRENT. Section 1303 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/ 11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1112) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (A) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a semicolon; (B) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (C) by adding at the end the following: ``(5) if the VIPR team is deployed to an airport, shall require, as appropriate based on risk, that the VIPR team conduct operations-- ``(A) in the sterile area and any other areas to which only individuals issued security credentials have unescorted access; and ``(B) in non-sterile areas.''; and (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2007 through 2011'' and inserting ``such sums as necessary, including funds to develop not more than 60 VIPR teams, for fiscal years 2016 through 2017''. SEC. 5033. LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING FOR MASS CASUALTY AND ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENTS. Section 2006(a)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 607(a)(2)) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (E) through (I) as subparagraphs (F) through (J), respectively; and (2) by inserting after subparagraph (D) the following: ``(E) training exercises to enhance preparedness for and response to mass casualty and active shooter incidents and security events at public locations, including airports and mass transit systems;''. SEC. 5034. ASSISTANCE TO AIRPORTS AND SURFACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. Section 2008(a) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609(a)) is amended-- (1) by redesigning paragraphs (9) through (13) as paragraphs (10) through (14), respectively; and (2) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following: ``(9) enhancing the security and preparedness of secure and non-secure areas of eligible airports and surface transportation systems.''. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, this amendment would strengthen U.S. airport security, especially in nonsecure or soft-target areas of airports--places such as check-in and baggage claim areas. It would also update Federal security programs to provide active shooter training for law enforcement and increase the presence of Federal agents with bomb-sniffing canines at these nonsecure areas. I thank the cosponsors of the amendment: Senator Manchin, Senator Schumer, Senator Nelson, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cantwell, Senator Carper, Senator Baldwin, Senator Durbin, Senator Bennet, and Senator Blumenthal. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the adoption of this amendment. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. [[Page S1780]] The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill and ask consent to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Pennsylvania Senator Toomey to talk about an issue we began to discuss on the floor yesterday, but we have been working many months on this issue. It is a rather simple issue, but it is a matter that has some real urgency connected to it because we are talking about a secondary barrier on airplanes--meaning a barrier other than what we know now to be a reinforced cockpit door--to prevent terrorists from getting into the cockpit. What we need to do in addition to that, after Congress mandated the installation of these reinforced cockpit doors, is add a secondary barrier. This is something that arises because we not only know from the attack on 9/11 but thereafter, we know that, No. 1, this is still an intention that terrorists have to take over an airplane. We know since 9/11, 51-- I will correct the record from yesterday, I think I said 15, I had transposed the number--but it is 51 hijacking attempts around the world since 9/11. This is not a problem that is going away, and we have to deal with it. This is the barrier we are talking about. So people understand the nature of this barrier, this is a lightweight wire mesh gate that would prevent a terrorist from getting into the cockpit or even getting to the door of the cockpit, which, as we said, is already reinforced. What it does fundamentally is block access to the flight deck. That is what we are talking about. That is what our amendment does. We know the substantial number of groups that support this. I will just read the list for the record. And this actually is support for the underlying bill that Senator Toomey and I and others have been working on for a while. The underlying bill itself was S. 911. Also, the amendment, amendment No. 3458, is endorsed by the following groups: the Airline Pilots Association, the Allied Pilots Association, the Association of Flight Attendants, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the US Airline Pilots Association, the Coalition of Airline Pilots Association, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, and Families of September 11. There have been numerous studies done. I am holding a study--although you can't see it from a distance--which was conducted by the Cato Institute, among others, on terrorism risk and cost-benefit analysis of aviation security. So we not only have substantial support from virtually every group you could point toward, but we have some expertise on how to protect pilots in the cockpit, how to protect passengers on an airplane, and, of course, how to do that by preventing terrorists from getting through or near the cockpit because of a good secondary barrier. This effort started literally from folks we now know in Pennsylvania. It started with, among other people, the Saracini family, Ellen Saracini, the wife of Captain Victor Saracini, who piloted United Flight 175, which terrorists hijacked and flew into the World Trade Center on 9/11. So in memory of Captain Saracini and inspired by the great work of his wife Ellen Saracini, we offer this amendment. Again, I am very pleased to be working on this with my colleague Senator Toomey, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to underscore the points made by my colleague Senator Casey. I thank him for his leadership. This is a very simple matter that is very straightforward and common sense. We know there is a very real vulnerability in our commercial aircraft. We know this. There is no mystery here. And we have a very simple, affordable, reasonable solution that will provide the security we need. After September 11, 2001, Congress very rightly mandated that the cockpit door be reinforced so that it is virtually impossible to destroy that door, to knock down that door, to defeat the purpose of that door when it is closed and latched. The problem is that when it is open--which it must be open periodically during many flights--a very strong door is useless. We know what happens now on airlines because we have all witnessed it, right? When a pilot needs to come out or go in or there is access to the cockpit when that door is open, the flight attendant rolls a little serving cart in front of the door. I suppose that is better than nothing, but it is not much better than nothing. That cart can be rolled away. We are not the only ones who have observed this. An FAA advisory has observed this risk. The 9/11 Commission pointed out that the terrorists were very focused on the opportunity created by the opening of the cockpit door. As Senator Casey pointed out, there have been multiple attempts to breach that door. Several have been successful. We have an amendment that solves this problem in a very affordable, reasonable, sensible way. It is a lightweight, collapsible barrier made of wire mesh, and a flight attendant can simply draw it across the opening, lock it, and then at that point the cockpit door can be opened and there is no way someone would be able to rush through that wire mesh in time to get to the cockpit during that moment when the door is open. That is what our amendment does. It passed the Transportation Committee in the House unanimously. As Senator Casey pointed out, it has very broad support from many of the stakeholders who care about the security of our commercial aviation. It is our hope and understanding that we will be very soon propounding a unanimous consent agreement which will allow this amendment to be pending and that this will be one of the amendments which will be on the docket for a subsequent vote. I hope we will get to that momentarily. I hope we will get that locked in, and then I would urge my colleagues to vote yes on our amendment and enhance commercial aviation safety. I yield the floor. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important matter before the Senate, the reauthorization of our Nation's Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA is tasked with a critical mission to manage the safety and the security of our Nation's airspace. Our Nation's airspace is an incredible resource that fuels our economy. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in 2015, a record 896 million passengers traversed America's skies. Our aviation system contributes $1.5 trillion to our Nation's economy and it supports 11.8 million jobs for hard-working Americans, as noted by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The Senate's FAA reauthorization bill will make our aviation system stronger for families, children, veterans, and the traveling public. It will also benefit Nebraska's rural airports and local aviation stakeholders. Notably, this carefully negotiated bill will strengthen America's aviation system without raising fees or taxes on airline passengers. Our robust, bipartisan legislation includes several major priorities I championed. I am proud of bipartisan language I worked to include in the bill, along with Senators Booker, Cantwell, and Ayotte. Our provision would compel the FAA to work with the airline industry to comprehensively assess and update guidelines for emergency medical kits on commercial aircraft. These kits, which haven't been statutorily updated since 1998, provide lifesaving resources for passengers. It is well past time for the FAA to evaluate medications and equipment included in these kits. Doing so will ensure all passengers, [[Page S1781]] particularly families with young infants facing unknown allergic reactions, have access to the medical supplies they might need in an emergency situation. In addition, I worked with Senator McCaskill to include an amendment that would make it easier for traveling mothers to care for their young infants. Our amendment unanimously passed the Commerce Committee. We worked closely with airport stakeholders, including Omaha's Eppley Airfield, to establish reasonable minimum standards for both medium- and large-hub airports to develop private rooms for nursing mothers in future capital development plans. Traveling as a new mom can be challenging and it can be stressful at times, but I believe this important change will provide increased flexibility and also peace of mind for mothers traveling through airports across our country. I also joined Senator Hirono to include an amendment that would ensure disabled veterans working at the FAA have access to service- connected disability leave. The FAA was one of the few agencies not included in the recently passed Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act. That bill required Federal agencies to ensure disabled vets have access to service-connected disability leave. Our disabled veterans bravely served our country, and they deserve access to benefits they have earned. I am grateful for the achievements this bill will advance for the flying public. At the same time, the bill is also a victory for Nebraska's rural communities and airports. The Small Airport Regulation Relief Act, which is included in the FAA bill, would create a temporary exemption for small airports so they can continue to receive airport improvement program funds--those AIP funds--despite downturns in air service. The survival of smaller airports, such as Scottsbluff's Western Nebraska Regional Airport, depends on these crucial funds to provide service to local passengers and businesses. Several of Nebraska's small and community airports, such as Alliance, Chadron, Grand Island, McCook, North Platte, and Scottsbluff, will also benefit from a continuation of the Essential Air Service, or EAS, Program. The EAS Program incentivizes air carriers to provide service to underserved and rural areas, and it is critical to ensuring air service continues for Nebraska's rural communities. Meanwhile, the Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island is growing and hosts a privately operated Federal contract tower. I encouraged the inclusion of provisions to compel the FAA to complete a pending cost-benefit analysis for Federal contract tower airports. This analysis would reflect the cost-share arrangement more accurately between our local airports and the FAA for those contract towers. Through this legislation, we can help to reduce the burden on local airports such as Grand Island, NE. One of the major challenges facing aviation manufacturers has been the FAA's inconsistent and often unclear regulatory process. I collaborated with Duncan Aviation of Lincoln, NE, the largest family- owned maintenance, repair, and overhaul organization in the world, to address this challenge. In fact, Chairman Thune toured the facilities at Duncan Aviation with me in Lincoln last fall. Our bill would provide clarity to aviation businesses like Duncan Aviation by compelling the FAA to establish a centralized safety guidance database. Moreover, the bill would require the FAA to establish a Regulatory Consistency Communications Board. The Board would set standards to ensure the consistent application of regulations and guidance at regional offices throughout our country. Agricultural aviators in Nebraska will also benefit from safety enhancements in this bill. Far too many of our agricultural pilots have died in recent years after collisions with unmarked utility towers. This legislation would ensure that towers are marked to create safer skies for our agriculture pilots. Passing our FAA bill will be a major accomplishment for the Senate. I appreciate and commend the hard work of Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and their committee staffers on this meaningful FAA reauthorization bill. In the coming days, I look forward to working together to help pass this critical legislation that will benefit the flying public, our national aviation system, and Nebraska's rural airports and aviation stakeholders. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment numbered 3512 be modified with the changes at the desk and that at 12:05 p.m. today the Senate vote on the following amendments in the order listed: Thune No. 3512, as modified; and Heinrich No. 3482, as modified; further that at 1:45 p.m. today the Senate vote on the Schumer amendment No. 3483 and that no second-degree amendments be in order to any of the amendments prior to the vote and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 3512), as modified, is as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE ___--TRANSPORTATION SECURITY AND TERRORISM PREVENTION Subtitle A--Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act SEC. _101. SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act''. SEC. _102. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) A number of recent airport security breaches in the United States have involved the use of Secure Identification Display Area (referred to in this section as ``SIDA'') badges, the credentials used by airport and airline workers to access the secure areas of an airport. (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at Hartsfield- Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged with using his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a number of months via commercial aircraft. (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation Safety Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and transport a firearm in his carry-on luggage. (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation found that over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport were lost or missing. (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, Transportation Security Administration contractors were indicted for participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed through the secure area of the San Francisco International Airport. (6) The Administration has indicated that it does not maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead relies on airport operators to track airport worker credentials. (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain threshold of missing SIDA badges. (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access control. (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security reported that the Administration did not have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers who had records in United States intelligence-related databases because the Administration was not authorized to receive all terrorism-related information under current interagency watchlisting policy. (10) The Inspector General also found that the Administration did not have appropriate checks in place to reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment investigations, including criminal history record checks and work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight over the airport operators that the Administration relies on to perform criminal history and work authorization checks for airport workers. (11) There is growing concern about the potential insider threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities. SEC. _103. DEFINITIONS.

(d) Family Seating.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations directing each air carrier to establish a policy that ensures that, if a family is traveling on a reservation with a child under the age of 13, that child is able to sit in a seat adjacent to the seat of an accompanying family member over the age of 13 at no additional cost. Amendment No. 3512, as Modified Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might just speak to amendment No. 3512, which we will be voting on momentarily, I know Senator Nelson has already spoken on this issue. We worked very hard on a series of security bills that we could bring to the floor. We are trying to move them separately, but I think they fit nicely into the debate we are having on the FAA reauthorization. Senators Nelson, Ayotte, Cantwell, and I have been leading oversight of airport and airline workers abusing their secure area access badges. This oversight led our committee to approve bipartisan legislation--S. 2361, Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act--to tighten the vetting of airport workers with ties to terrorists and serious criminal behavior that should disqualify them from accessing sensitive airport areas. Just in the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers have been caught in the act of helping criminal organizations. On March 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine after being confronted by transportation security officers in California. On March 26 in Florida, an airline gate agent was arrested with a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an associate. As we work to address the threat of an aviation insider helping terrorists, [[Page S1786]] criminals who break laws for financial gain and those with a history of violence are a really good place to start. It is high time that we start cracking down on these types of offenses for people who are working in sensitive areas of our airports. U.S. terrorism experts believe that ISIS is recruiting criminals to join its ranks in Europe, and some of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in Brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals. Ensuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that experts believe an ISIS affiliate may have planted a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight leaving Egypt with the help of an airport employee, which killed 224 people on board. The recent attacks by ISIS in the unsecured area of the Brussels Airport also underscore the vulnerability of airport areas outside of TSA security screening checkpoints. The House of Representatives and the Commerce Committee also approved legislation--H.R. 2843, the PreCheck Expansion Act--in December of 2015 to expand the PreCheck program by developing private sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. These private sector partners would be required to use an assessment equivalent to a fingerprint-based criminal history record check conducted through the FBI. These changes would increase the number of passengers who are vetted before they get to the airport. As a result, more passengers would receive expedited airport screening and get through security checkpoints more quickly, ensuring they don't pose the kind of easy target that the ISIS suicide bombers exploited at the Brussels Airport. In addition to the bills approved by our committee on March 23, the House Homeland Security Committee approved H.R. 4698, the SAFE GATES Act of 2016, which would strengthen security at international airports with direct flights to the United States. Specifically, the bill would require TSA to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of all last- point-of-departure airports, a security coordination enhancement plan, and a workforce assessment. It would authorize the TSA to donate security screening equipment to foreign last-point-of-departure airports and to evaluate foreign countries' air cargo security programs to prevent any shipment of nefarious materials via air cargo. I believe these bills will help make air travel more secure, and they should advance in the full Senate in this amendment to the FAA bill. I encourage my colleagues to support the Thune-Nelson amendment and then also follow-on with the Heinrich amendment, which will come up shortly after a vote on that amendment. I think the Heinrich amendment also makes a number of important security improvements that will also strengthen airport security. There has been a discussion about whether there ought to be more VIPR teams. I think there are 30 or so at this point, and the amendment would allow that number to go up to 60. Yesterday we had the opportunity to question the TSA Administrator, Admiral Neffenger, about whether additional VIPR teams would be useful. He said they could put to use anything they were given in terms of additional units that might be deployed to places around the country where they think there is a need. So that is the principal component of the Heinrich amendment, which also addresses some of the security issues. I don't think we can understate how important security is in light of everything that is going on in the world today. We have people who want to harm Americans, and it is our job to make sure we are giving those authorities who are there to prevent those types of attacks against Americans all the tools they need in order to do their jobs effectively. I encourage our colleagues here in the Senate--when we have an opportunity to vote here momentarily on both of these security amendments--to support those amendments. They improve and strengthen security at our airports around this country, and I think they fit nicely within the context of the FAA reauthorization bill and the debate we are currently having on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida. Amendment No. 3483 to Amendment No. 3464 Mr. NELSON.

REGULATIONS RELATING TO SPACE FOR PASSENGERS ON AIRCRAFT. (a) Moratorium on Reductions to Aircraft Seat Size.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prohibit any air carrier from reducing the size, width, padding, or pitch of seats on passenger aircraft operated by the air carrier, the amount of leg room per seat on such aircraft, or the width of aisles on such aircraft. (b) Regulations Relating to Space for Passengers on Aircraft.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall prescribe regulations-- (1) establishing minimum standards for space for passengers on passenger aircraft, including the size, width, padding, and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room per seat, and the width of aisles on such aircraft for the safety, health, and comfort of passengers; and (2) requiring each air carrier to prominently display on the website of the air carrier the amount of space available for each passenger on passenger aircraft operated by the air carrier, including the size, width, padding, and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room per seat, and the width of aisles on such aircraft. (c) Consultations.--In prescribing the regulations required by subsection (b), the Administrator shall consult with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, passenger advocacy organizations, physicians, and ergonomic engineers. (d) Air Carrier Defined.--In this section, the term ``air carrier'' means an air carrier (as defined in section 40102 of title 49, United States Code) that transports passengers by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in just 5 minutes we will have our first series of votes on amendments on this bill. This is a good start to the FAA bill. It is improving the underlying bill that has a lot of attention to security already in it. But these are clearly amendments that will improve the bill. I spoke about it earlier today. I certainly commend these amendments to the Senate. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The clerk will call the roll.

Amendment No. 3482, as Modified The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3482, as modified, offered by the Senator from New Mexico. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, airports, bus depots, and train stations are things that we all rely on every day to have the freedom of movement we enjoy in this country. In the wake of the recent terror attacks in the Brussels Airport and Metro, Americans are worried about their security, and they want to feel safe when traveling with their loved ones. While we relentlessly target terrorists overseas, we must also do all we can to intelligently protect Americans here at home. My amendment would increase the number of TSA VIPR teams, who provide a visible deterrent to terrorist threats in high-priority locations. These teams are recognizable as they often have bomb-sniffing canines. My amendment would also provide active shooter training for law enforcement and strengthen security in nonsecure so-called soft-target areas, such as check-in and baggage claim areas. By employing these additional commonsense safeguards, we will intelligently respond to these threats. Most importantly, by preserving our freedom to go about our daily lives, we will ensure that the terrorists have failed to change how we live and who we are. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the Heinrich amendment. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. Iranian Access to U.S. Financial System Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, when Obama administration officials sold the President's nuclear deal last summer to the American people, they were clearly sensitive to charges that they gave too much away. They knew that giving Iran $100 billion that we could never get back in exchange for a mere temporary deal that expired in 10 to 15 years would be viewed with deep skepticism. They knew that an inspection system that gives the ayatollahs a 24- day heads-up before an inspection would not pass the laugh test. They knew that granting the ayatollahs massive sanctions relief while still allowing them to develop an industrial-scale nuclear enrichment program would invite accusations that the President was, to put it frankly, swindled. So in their sales pitch, these administration officials sought to blunt these expected criticisms. They repeatedly stated that the United States would maintain certain tough sanctions, even after the deal became effective. They said the United States would hold the line on measures that punish and suppress Iran's nonnuclear malign activities. They emphatically stated that in no way would the U.S. economy be allowed to bolster an Iranian economy that is significantly controlled by the Iranian regime, tainted by illicit financing of terrorism, and used by the ayatollahs to fund domestic oppression and international aggression--including blowing up hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq with roadside bombs. In particular, these administration officials were emphatic that the United States would never, ever, ever grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system and U.S. dollars to facilitate Iran's trade in oil and other goods. For instance, when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew stated: Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with U.S. banks. Iran, in other words, will continue to be denied access to the world's largest financial and commercial market. Likewise, Adam Szubin, the Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, echoed that sentiment and was even more precise. In September he stated: Iran will not be able to open bank accounts with U.S. banks, nor will Iran be able to access the U.S. banking sector, even for that momentary transaction to, what we call, dollarize a foreign payment. . . . That is not in the cards. That is not part of the relief offered under the JCPOA. So, the U.S. sanctions on Iran, which, of course, had their origins long before Iran had a nuclear program, will remain in place. [[Page S1788]] It is difficult to overstate the importance of these statements uttered just a few months ago. The U.S. dollar is the standard currency in which international trade is conducted. Because the ayatollahs can't deal in dollars, they haven't fully opened their economy to the world-- thankfully. In addition, the U.S. financial system hasn't yet been tainted by Iran's terror financing, its international aggression, and its crackdown on domestic democratic dissent. But now, a mere 7 months into a 15-year agreement, the Obama administration is shedding the resolve its officials tried to so hard to display before Congress. According to numerous reports, the administration intends to backtrack on the statements of Secretary Lew and Adam Szubin. It is looking for some way, somehow to give Iran access to U.S. dollars to boost Iranian trade and investment. I want to be very clear. If the President moves to grant Iran access to the U.S. dollar--whether directly or indirectly--there will be consequences. If there is any statement, guidance, regulation, or Executive action that opens the U.S. banking sector to Iran even a crack, the Senate will hold hearings with each official who assured the American people last summer that the ayatollahs would never access the dollar. We will explore whether they lied back then or whether they intend to resign in protest now. If this policy change moves forward, I will dedicate myself to working with my colleagues to pass legislation blocking the change. If the Obama administration proceeds with this massive concession to the ayatollahs, every Member of the Senate who voted to accept the Iranian deal will have to go home and explain why the U.S. economy is now complicit in Iran's financing of terrorist attacks against Americans and American allies. That the Obama administration would even consider allowing Iran access to the U.S. banking sector is extremely disconcerting, but it is not surprising. It follows a steady pattern that has become increasingly clear since the conclusion of the nuclear deal. Time and again, Iran provokes the United States, commits brazen acts to destabilize its neighbors, and threatens to undo the Iran deal. In response, the United States rushes to grant the ayatollahs more concessions in order to placate them. Iran has tested ballistic missiles, captured U.S. sailors, and fueled conflicts in Syria and Yemen with fresh arms and troops--all while employing ``Death to America'' as a rallying cry. But in the face of Iran's continued aggression, the President has displayed only weakness. Instead of steeling himself for a fight with the ayatollahs, he has laid down and rolled over for them. He has repeatedly refused to designate Iran's tests of ballistic missiles as the violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions they so clearly are. The President also agreed to send an additional $1.7 billion to the ayatollahs, ostensibly to settle outstanding claims. For good measure, that $1.7 billion includes $1.3 billion in gratuitous interest payments. The President granted clemency to seven convicted Iranian criminals and dismissed arrest warrants for 14 Iranian fugitives who faced charges for sanctions violations. Now the President may be on the verge of granting the largest concession yet--dollarizing Iran's international trade and declaring Iran truly open for business. We should call this for what it is--concession creep. In the same manner that no Member of the Senate should trust Iran to abide by its commitments made in the Iranian nuclear deal, we can no longer trust the administration to hold fast to the specific concessions contained in the four corners of that deal. The ink is hardly dry on the deal, and the President has already shown himself all too susceptible to the temptations of appeasement. The ayatollahs reportedly have complained to U.S. officials that it is too hard to transact business without access to U.S. dollars. The answer to that should be ``too bad.'' It should not be easy for the world's worst sponsor of terrorism to do business with the global economy. It should not be easy for industries dominated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to trade in financial markets. International business leaders, directors, CEOs, and general counsels should not rush into Iran for fear of the grave reputational, financial, political, and legal consequences of doing business with this outlaw regime. The Iranians know the Obama administration is desperate to preserve the nuclear deal. They hold the possibility of walking away from the agreement as a sword of Damocles over the President's head in order to extract concession after concession. They lord it over him in order to forestall any U.S. action that would meaningfully stop their regional aggression and campaign of terror. So intense is President Obama's fear that the Ayatollah will rip up the nuclear agreement, he has completely upended U.S. strategy in the Middle East to the point where adversaries are allies and allies are becoming adversaries. This parade of concessions must stop, and it must stop now. The administration must fully implement all new sanctions passed by Congress to punish Iran's development of ballistic missiles, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its human rights abuses. It must work with our traditional allies in the Middle East to neutralize Iran's attempt to foment instability throughout the region. The President should issue a very clear order that Iran will not be granted any direct or indirect access to the U.S. banking system and the dollar. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. (The remarks of Mr. Merkley pertaining to the introduction of S. 2760 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Amendment No. 3490 to Amendment No. 3464 Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3490. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] proposes an amendment numbered 3490 to amendment No. 3464. Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To extend protections against physical assault to air carrier customer service representatives) Strike section 5009 and insert the following: SEC. 5009. INTERFERENCE WITH AIR CARRIER EMPLOYEES. (a) In General.--Section 46503 is amended by inserting after ``to perform those duties'' the following ``, or who assaults an air carrier customer representative in an airport, including a gate or ticket agent, who is performing the duties of the representative or agent,''. (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 46503 is amended in the section heading by inserting ``or air carrier customer representatives'' after ``screening personnel''. (c) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for chapter 465 is amended by striking the item relating to section 46503 and inserting the following: ``46503. Interference with security screening personnel or air carrier customer representatives.''. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up this amendment and offer it because the issue is making sure that those who work in the air transportation system are safe and secure. This is an important issue to the men and women who work at Sea-Tac and at other airports and are part of the delivery system of making sure air transportation is safe. They are an integral part of air transportation at every airport in the United States of America. This issue is something that has been considered in the House of Representatives as part of the transportation package as well, and it is part of what we think should be in this package in the Senate; that is, making sure that those who are part of the delivery system--ticket counter agents, agents who are aiding and assisting in getting passengers through the terminals and onto planes at the gate, assisting, as many of the challenging days go by, in delivering good air transportation service. What has happened is that these individuals have become victims--the victims of physical, violent abuse; that is, the public has taken to bodily harm against these individuals. So this amendment puts in similar safeguards [[Page S1789]] that are in line with other transportation officials who are protected from this kind of physical abuse. I will have more to say on it, but I know my colleague is trying to get to the floor to speak as well. I will put into the Record examples of individuals who are ticketing agents, baggage agents, air transportation delivery system workers who have been hurt, and they deserve to have protection. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 3483 Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge a ``yes'' vote on the upcoming amendment to require the FAA to set a minimum standard seat size. This amendment would ensure that airlines can't keep chopping down on seat size and legroom until consumers are packed in like sardines in a can on every flight. Over the last few decades, between the size of the seat and the distance between the seats, the flying public has lost half a foot of their space. Flying is not pleasant anymore. You are crammed in. I am not that tall--a little under 6-foot-1. What I do when I fly is I take out the magazine and the air-sickness bag and the little folder that shows you where the exits are to gain one-sixteenth of an inch more legroom. Moms with kids have a lot of trouble in those very narrow seats. Have you ever been in the situation where you are in the middle and there are two sort of large people on either side of you? It is not the most pleasant flying experience. We don't have too much competition anymore. We have very few airlines. This is a place where the public is clamoring for change. When I said I was going to offer this amendment, I got more feedback on it than most other things. And you don't have to be 6-foot-4 to understand the problem. You would think that by cramming in more and more passengers on each flight, the airlines could lower their prices. Instead, several major airlines went in the other direction: They started charging for the extra inches and legroom that were once considered standard. So it practically costs you an arm and a leg just to have space for your arms and legs. At a time when airlines are making record profits, at a time when fuel costs are extremely low, we need this amendment to protect consumers' safety and comfort. This amendment would do three things. It doesn't set a standard seat size; it freezes the current seat size in place so they can't shrink it any further. It directs the FAA to set minimum standard seat size and pitch for all commercial flights. And some of this involves comfort, but some of it involves safety. God forbid there is something terrible happening on a plane--the seats are so narrow, it is harder for people to get out. Finally, we focus on transparency. We require airlines to post their seat sizes on their Web sites, providing at least a commercial incentive for airlines to offer more comfortable seat arrangements. Most folks travel under the expectation that the airlines are going to set the guidelines and that is that; there is nothing they can do about it. We actually had to put in the underlying bill that airlines should refund bag fees charged to consumers if the airline lost their bags. And I would say to my good friends on the other side, if we can mandate that bag fees be returned--not leave it up to the free market-- we can mandate that the FAA at least set a proper seat size. They can't say: Well, leave it up to the free market on one but not on the other. It is not a little fair. Now we see why we need these amendments. The bag fee--and I agree that if they lose your bags or delay your bags, they shouldn't keep the extra bag fee. It should be refunded. In most industries, that would be a standard practice. If you fail to deliver a service somebody paid for, they should get their money back. But sometimes in the airline industry you have to require basic courtesy. In conclusion, the great Abraham Lincoln was once asked how long a man's legs should be, and he famously answered: Long enough to reach from the body to the ground. If you asked a major airline today how long a man's legs should be, they would say: Short enough to miss the tray table. That is no way to fly. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and move this bill in a more consumer-friendly direction. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have to catch planes, and it takes extra time for them to squeeze into those small seats with no legroom. So I yield back my time, and I ask unanimous consent that we move the vote up to right now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3483. Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass the legislation we passed here in the Senate a few weeks ago called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. We passed it on March 10, which was 27 days ago--almost a month. It is estimated that we lose about 120 Americans every day to drug overdoses. That means that during that time period--those 27 days--we lost about 3,240 additional Americans who we represent to substance abuse and death from heroin and prescription drug overdoses. Since 2007, drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than any other cause of accidental death, even surpassing car accidents. It is probably [[Page S1790]] true nationally now as well. Addiction is treatable, but 9 out of 10 people who need treatment aren't getting it. That is a tragedy. It shows that the system we have right now just isn't working, and that is what our legislation addresses, among other things. In one 5-day span since we passed CARA, just in the last month, we had five people die from heroin and Fentanyl overdoses in one of the cities I represent-- Cleveland, OH. I was in Athens, OH, more than 2 weeks after we passed CARA, and received a tour of the Rural Women's Addiction Recovery Bassett House facility. Dr. Joe Gay and Ruth Tarter took me around so I could meet some of the brave women who stepped forward to treat their addiction issues. Some of them were there with their kids. They have an amazing success rate. I will tell you that 3 days after I left Athens, OH, $40,000 of heroin was seized at a traffic stop very close to this treatment facility. It is everywhere. It knows no ZIP code. It is in rural areas, suburban areas, and inner cities. States are starting to take action. Ohio is taking action, your States are taking action, and communities are taking action. Local leaders know this is a problem, but they want the Federal Government to be a better partner. That is what CARA provides. It provides best practices from around the country. It provides more funding for some critical elements that are evidence- based--based on research and what actually works. Our States and local communities are desperate for this right now. By the way, this legislation is not just bipartisan. It is also bicameral. In other words, not only have Republicans and Democrats worked across the aisle here in the Senate over the last 3 years putting this bill together, but our colleagues in the House have worked together as well. I am encouraged by the fact that the CARA legislation in the House has 113 cosponsors. It is bipartisan. It is based on good evidence. It is based on a lot of work and effort. Today I heard through a media account that one of the House leaders said there is interest in moving something even this month. That is great. But he also talked about hearings and markups and so on. Let's be sure the hearings and markups don't delay what we know we should do, which is to pass the CARA legislation. It has been bicameral and bipartisan. It passed the Senate with a 94-to-1 vote. That never happens around here-- 94 to 1. This is legislation which we know will make a difference right now in our communities that are dealing with a crisis we all face. Let's move this legislation. I say to my friends in the House with all due respect, this legislation has been carefully crafted and we have done the hard work. I mentioned that we spent 3 years of factfinding on this bill. We didn't think we had all the right answers, so we went out to experts all over the country. We took time to listen. We consulted with them. We listened to experts, doctors, law enforcement, and patients in recovery. We listened to the drug experts in the Obama administration, such as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP. They have been very helpful. We brought in people from Health and Human Services and listened to them. We brought in people from my home State of Ohio and other States around the country. We heard from family members, many of whom have channelled their grief at losing a loved one into advocacy for the CARA legislation because they know it is going to help. One testified in the Judiciary Committee when we marked up the legislation. Tonda DaRe from Carrollton, OH, talked about having lost her daughter, who was a very successful high school student and engaged to be married. Everything was going great. When she turned 21, she made a mistake: She tried heroin. She went into recovery. She relapsed. She ended up dying of an overdose. Unfortunately, this is a story that is retold all over our country. There are moms, there are dads, there are aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters who come forward to tell us these tragic stories about losing a loved one. They want this legislation to pass because they know it is going to help another family member or a friend or a coworker or someone whom they have never met but whom they want to help so they don't have to go through the grief they have gone through. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse--a Democrat--and I have worked on this legislation together, along with many other people in this Chamber. We have also worked, as I said, with many on the House side. We worked with folks on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol because this has become an issue that affects us all. It is a nonpartisan issue. We have to move it forward. We held five forums here in Washington, DC, and brought in experts to get counsel and advice. They helped us develop a legislative proposal that was thoughtful because it actually addressed the real problem. In April 2014, we had a forum on the criminal justice system which included alternatives to incarceration, and you will see that in our legislation. The notion is, for users who get arrested for possession, let's not just throw them in jail because that hasn't worked. Let's get them into treatment and get them into a recovery program that works. In July 2014, we held a forum on how women are impacted by this drug epidemic, looking particularly at addiction and treatment responses. Some new data that is out there now shows that most of the people who are suffering from heroin and prescription drug addiction are women. In December 2014, we held a forum on the science of addiction--how we could get at this from a medical point of view, how we could come up with better medical approaches to this to be able to stop the craving, to deal with the addiction problem, to get people through withdrawal. We also talked about how to address some of the collateral consequences of addiction. In April of 2015, we held a forum on our youth and how we can better promote drug prevention. After all, keeping people from getting into the funnel of addiction in the first place has to be a priority. To help people avoid going down that funnel of addiction, we need better prevention, better education. That is part of our legislation. We also had input about what is working in recovery and what is not working in recovery. We held a forum in July of 2015 to talk about our veterans, to talk about the very sad situation with veterans who are coming back to our shores who have PTSD--post-traumatic stress disorder--and who have brain injuries. Some recent data shows that about 20 percent of returning veterans with those issues are becoming addicted to prescription drugs or heroin; therefore, veterans courts are a major part of our legislation. These are drug courts that are focused on mental health and addiction specifically for our veterans. I have seen them in Ohio. They are working great. It is unbelievable. I talked to a guy who has been in and out of the system his whole life. He is about 45 years old now. He finally found this court that was going to help him--took him out of jail and got him into treatment. Hanging over his head was the possibility of incarceration if he didn't do the right thing and stay clean. He is now a senior at Ohio State University and is about to get his degree, and he reunited with his family for the first time in many years. He is clean. It can work. The final result was the legislative text that reflected this open and deliberative process I am talking about. This bill--just like the research it supports--is evidence-based. We didn't ask who had the idea; we just asked whether it was a good idea. It is no wonder that CARA now has support from 130 national groups, from the Fraternal Order of Police, to stakeholders in public health-- doctors and nurses, those in recovery, experts in the field, people who actually know what is going on because they are in the trenches working on this. They want this bill passed. They know it will help them and help them now. As I said, that vote was 94 to 1, which means 94 Senators say this bill is ready to go. These are Senators from every State in the Union who support this legislation, therefore representing every congressional district in the United States of America. It makes sense. It expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent opiate abuse, the use of heroin and prescription drugs. It increases drug-disposal sites to get medications out of people's hands and get it into the right hands. It takes [[Page S1791]] this medication off the bathroom shelves. It has a drug-monitoring program to get at the overprescribing issue. So many people who are currently addicted to heroin started with prescription drugs. In fact, the majority did. There is different data out there, but it is very clear that prescription drugs are a huge part of heroin addiction. It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and meth. Law enforcement has an important role to play here. It expands training and the availability of naloxone, or Narcan, to law enforcement. This is for our firefighters. When you go to a firehouse in your State--for those listening in the House, in your district--ask them: Are you going on more fire runs or are you going on more runs to help people with overdoses? They will tell you what they tell me: overdoses. That is what it has come to. That is happening in your fire department in your community. By the way, to tell you how much this law can make a difference-- because we do help get the training for them to be able to use Narcan and get the Narcan or naloxone into the right hands--Ohio public safety officials have administered naloxone over 16,000 times since 2015-- 16,000 overdoses that might otherwise have resulted in death. For the most part, this miracle drug works. First responders know how important it is. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police supports this bill. They want to equip their officers, but so do the firefighters. CARA also supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. To avoid people getting into addiction in the first place, it also creates a national task force on recovery because there is a lot of information out there we need to bring together to find out what works and what doesn't work precisely in terms of dealing with the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. CARA expands treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies who suffer from what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. What does that mean? That means babies who are born addicted. In Ohio, tragically, we had a 750-percent increase in the number of babies born with addiction in the last 12 years. I have been to the hospitals. I have been to St. Rita's in Lima. I have been to Rainbow Babies in Cleveland. I have been to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. I have seen these babies. These are tiny babies who are addicted, and they have to be taken through withdrawal. The compassionate nurses and doctors who are doing it--God bless them--I asked them: What is going to happen to these babies? They told me: Rob, we don't know. We don't know the long-term consequences because it is so new. But it is dramatic and it is happening in all of your hospitals. These neonatal units are now taking on a whole other task, which is helping babies through withdrawal. I visited folks who are not only pregnant but are addicted, and I talked to them about what they are going through and what the consequences are going to be, and it is sad. Many say: Rob, the grip of addiction is so great. I am now in treatment, but I worry about what is going to happen to my baby. We also expand treatment for expectant and postpartum women for that reason. And these expectant and postpartum women who need this help can make the right decision with more help from us. It expands residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction. It creates a pilot program to provide family-based services to women who are addicted to opiates. CARA also helps veterans, as I said. It allows those veterans to get into a veterans court, where they can get help to walk through how they get out of this addiction, how they get into recovery. They can get support from other veterans around them to provide the kind of help they need to get out of this cycle of incarceration and addiction. What do we say to the 40 million Americans who are struggling with addiction when they ask ``Why don't you guys act?'' The Senate acted 94 to 1. Why can't we get this done? It is time to move. They shouldn't have to wait. We shouldn't have to wait. To those 40 million who struggle, to those who think they can't overcome this addiction, to those who believe there is no one out there to help them, the message is, you are not alone. There is hope. You can beat this. I have seen it. There are people who care and want to help. There are so many heartbreaking stories of addiction, but there are also so many stories of hope. I think about Vanessa Perkins from Nelsonville, OH. Vanessa became addicted to heroin. Once she became addicted, she also became a victim of sex trafficking. Those two are related. In Ohio, they tell me that most sex trafficking has now to do with heroin addiction. In other words, the trafficker gets these women--usually women--addicted to heroin, and that is one way they become dependent on their trafficker. What Vanessa tells me is that it took her a long time to turn her life around, but she was courageous and brave enough to seek treatment, and she is now back on track. For the last 6 years she has been helping others, taking her experience and using it to help others deal with their addiction. She is on the board of a group called Freedom a la Cart, which is a company in Columbus, OH, that I visited last month that provides job opportunities for trafficking victims. They do a heck of a job and teach these women a trade, too--culinary arts. Now so many of these women who had been trafficked, who had been heroin addicts, are back on their feet, reunited with their families, and know the dignity and self-respect that come from the work they are doing and from helping others. There is hope. Treatment can work. Mr. President, leaders in the House say they want to move anti-heroin legislation through regular order. Again, I heard today that one of the leaders said they are planning to take action. I had conversations with Speaker Ryan on this issue. I had conversations with other leaders in the House on it. I take them at their word. I am hopeful we will see the House begin to act next week when that Chamber returns, but I will say this: The House must act, and they must act soon. I am not going to be patient on this. This is urgent, and people's lives are at stake. The House must pass this bill so the President can sign it and so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives of the people we represent. This is our responsibility. We need to take advantage of this opportunity that the Senate has given us by this huge vote--94 to 1--to get this legislation to the President and get it enacted into law. Mr. President, I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. FLINT, MICHIGAN, WATER CRISIS Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I would like to speak about two different subjects. Both are connected in the sense that they involve lack of action and people counting on us to act as a Senate. The first involves the fact that today in the city of Flint, MI, we still have people who can't drink the water coming out of the tap. I think any one of us would have trouble if that happened for 1 day, but we are talking about months and months--going on 2 years now--that we have seen a system completely broken down because of decisions, because of lack of treating the water, a whole range of things. From my perspective, the most important thing is the fact that people still don't have access to clean, safe water. They can't bathe their babies. They can't take a shower themselves. I can't imagine what it must be like for families in Flint who are waiting and waiting for help. I want to thank President Obama for doing what he can do through the administration to help from the standpoint of health and nutrition and education, but the fundamental problem is replacing the damaged pipes. As my colleagues know, we have been working very hard and we have developed a bipartisan proposal. I wish to thank the chair and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell, for working with us, and so many colleagues who are now bipartisan cosponsors on a bill with myself and Senator Peters. I wish to thank Senator Inhofe as chair of EPW and ranking member Senator Boxer and so many people who have [[Page S1792]] come together to support this effort, not only for Flint, but we now are seeing headlines across the country about other areas where lead poisoning in water is a serious issue and where we have all kinds of communities with water infrastructure needs. We have put together a proposal. We have a bipartisan proposal. We are ready to move forward. We need a vote on this proposal. As people in this building know, the junior Senator from Utah is holding us up from being able to get that vote. We have spent weeks now--weeks-- trying to find a way to get beyond this objection. We thought we had an agreement, and then the bar just keeps changing. This is not a game. These are real people, and we are trying to solve a real problem. We have put forward a proposal fully paid for that actually reduces the deficit, paid for out of a program that I care deeply about because I authored it in 2007, and prior to Senator Peters being a Senator, when he was in the House, he was the champion of the program that we are offering to use as a payfor. So I just want to remind everyone--and I am going to continue to come to the floor and remind colleagues every day--that a group of Americans in a city of 100,000 where there has been a Federal emergency declared are still waiting for us to act to help them--not to do the whole thing, not to pay for all of what needs to be done in terms of water infrastructure, but to do our part as a Federal Government, as we have done in communities across the country for other kinds of emergencies. We need to help the children of Flint. Nine thousand children under the age of six are being exposed to lead poisoning; some homes have exposure higher than a toxic waste dump. I can tell my colleagues as a mother and now as a grandmother, I would never tolerate something like that. I can't imagine what is happening for families. We have the opportunity to do something. It is easy. It is fully paid for. It is fully paid for by something that colleagues on the other side of the aisle have wanted to eliminate--fully paid for. It helps communities across the country. Now we have a situation where one Member has indicated, well, it is not his problem. He doesn't care; it is not his problem. I hope as Americans we are willing to say that other people's problems--I would think we care about them, whether it is our own children, our own grandchildren, people we know or not. That is what we expect when there are emergencies and disasters across the country. And whether it is in the farm bill that I worked on with the distinguished Presiding Officer where we strengthened livestock disaster assistance-- even though that is not a huge issue to me in the State of Michigan, but I know it is for a lot of States and a lot of communities. That is what we do as Americans. We care about people and communities. We have a group of people right now who are not being seen. I want my colleagues to see this baby and the picture this represents of a group of people who are waiting for help and deserve help. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. President, I wish to address something else now and turn to history to talk about somebody else who is waiting. He can drink his water and take a shower. That is a good thing. But we have a very distinguished jurist, the Chief Judge of the DC Court of Appeals, nominated by the President of the United States to be a Supreme Court Justice, who is waiting for the opportunity to be heard, to have a hearing, to meet with people, to have a vote, yes or no. We have spoken a lot about the Constitution, about responsibilities, about debates. Our three branches of government are sworn to uphold both the written word of the Constitution and the spirit of the Constitution. This spirit was expressed in a series of articles beginning in 1787. I wasn't there at the time. But in reading what our Founding Fathers said--those who framed the Constitution--I think it is important to look at what they intended through the Federalist Papers. On April 1, 1788, Alexander Hamilton, writing in Federalist Paper No. 76, outlined two specific roles for Supreme Court nominees: that the President nominate Justices and the Senate provide advice and consent. Hamilton explained how the Senate held the power to reject a nominee, to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from family connection, from personal attachment, or from other biases. As my colleagues know, Senators can investigate the character of a nominee by meeting the nominee in person, by holding hearings, and by looking at their writings. At the Senate Judiciary Committee they can ask the nominee questions in full view of the public. Based on responses, if they believe a nominee does not have the appropriate character, they can reject the nomination. They can vote no. That is our right as Senators. But Senators in the current Republican majority are refusing to do any of that. They have said they will not hold hearings. Most of them will not even meet with the nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. I want to commend Republican Senators who are, in fact, meeting with Judge Garland. This is their job. This is our job--the job established for us by America's Founding Fathers--and a majority of the majority is refusing to do it. Now, according to the average time for moving a Supreme Court nominee through the process, if the Republican majority did their job, as previous Senates did, then there would be a hearing of the Judiciary Committee by April 27, but there is none scheduled. The Judiciary Committee would hold a vote by May 12, but there is no vote coming. And based on historical precedent, the Supreme Court nominee would then come to the floor for a vote on confirmation before Memorial Day. But because my colleagues across the aisle are refusing to do their job, that vote will not happen. My Republican colleagues like to say that the Senate does not confirm Supreme Court nominees during a Presidential year, but that doesn't square with the facts. More than a dozen Supreme Court nominees have been confirmed by the Senate in an election year. In 1988, also a Presidential year, the Senate did its job by confirming President Reagan's Supreme Court nominee, Justice Anthony Kennedy, with a Democratically controlled Senate. In 1940, another Presidential election year, the Senate did its job by confirming President Franklin Roosevelt's nominee, Justice Frank Murphy. In 1932, the Senate did its job by confirming President Hoover's Supreme Court nominee. In 1916, the Senate did its job twice by confirming President Wilson's two nominees for the Supreme Court. The U.S. Constitution was ratified in June 1788, just a few months after Hamilton published the Federalist Paper I mentioned a few minutes ago. And for nearly 228 years--228 years--during times of war, times of peace, periods of prosperity, and periods of economic hardship, America has balanced the powers between the executive and the legislative branches in selecting who would serve in the third branch of government. We have done it during Democratic majorities and Republican majorities for 228 years. To those who are refusing to hold hearings on a nomination, my question is this: What has changed? What has changed this year? What is it about this President that causes him to be treated this way? What is it that is leading my colleagues to question the judgment and the wisdom of Alexander Hamilton and the rest of the Founding Fathers who signed the Constitution and gave us the responsibility for advice and consent? In short, why now are you refusing to do your job? Just do your job. Do what we are paid to do. Last month, I went over in front of the Supreme Court on a beautiful, sunny day when a lot of people were here visiting, and I talked to a number of citizens and asked them what they thought about what was happening, the debate going on about filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. I also asked them what would happen to you if during a year you told your employer that a major part of your job--a very big responsibility that you have in your job--you were going to refuse to do for a year or so. What would happen? Well, the answer is pretty easy. People said: I would be fired. People say: Why aren't you doing your job? Why isn't the majority doing its job? Because if you are not willing to do the work, why should you have the job? Nobody else can do that in their job. [[Page S1793]] That is why the polls show overwhelmingly that the American people side with those of us on the Democratic side, with all of us who stand together as Democratic Senators to say: Do your job. We are willing to do our job. People stand with the Constitution and with the overwhelming history of our country. It is very simple. It is a very simple idea. It is a phrase we say all the time in all kinds of circumstances. We say to our children, we say to people we work with: Just do your job. Well, this is our job. Hold a hearing, meet with the nominee, have a vote. You can vote yes; you can vote no. You could skip that day. But this judge deserves a vote, and it is our responsibility to vote and to fill the vacancy on the highest Court in the land. That is what the American people expect us to do. That is what they deserve. It is time that the Senate do its job. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss several provisions in an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill that is currently before the Senate and that specifically benefits my home State of Louisiana. There are more than 253 air traffic control towers throughout the country operating through a successful public-private partnership called the Federal Contract Tower Program. This program is especially critical to rural areas--as I have in Louisiana and as does the Presiding Officer--to ensure that America's airspace and the traveling public are safe. However, there are currently 30 towers awaiting the FAA to finalize an internal agency formula called the benefit-cost analysis, referred to as the BCA, which will allow eligible towers to enter the Federal Contract Tower Program. One of these airports is the Hammond Northshore Regional Airport in Hammond, LA. The Federal Contract Tower Program has been in place for more than 30 years and is a prime example of an effective public-private partnership between government and the private sector. Contract towers handle approximately 28 percent of the Nation's air traffic control tower operations but account for only 14 percent of the FAA's total tower operations budget. Repeated studies by the U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general have shown that the Contract Tower Program increases aviation safety while reducing costs to taxpayers and the Federal Government. It is also important to note that approximately 80 percent of the contract controller workforce are veterans. Congress has demonstrated numerous times in bipartisan fashion the merit and need for the Federal Contract Tower Program. Given the success of the program and the increasing likelihood of further FAA delays, I am pleased the Commerce Committee included language in the FAA reauthorization bill to strengthen and improve the Federal Contract Tower Program. Senators Cornyn, Vitter, Portman, and Wicker have been leaders on this issue, and their work is greatly appreciated. Currently, America's trade and economy are being hampered because many cargo planes from other countries are prohibited from flying into U.S. airports because they have not been upgraded to newer types of technology. Some aircraft are what is called ``Stage 2 aircraft.'' These aircraft were phased out following the passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, which mandated the phaseout for Stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds. I have introduced an amendment that would permit flights to a small number of airports under limited circumstances for revenue and nonrevenue flights of Stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds. One of the airports that meets the criteria is the Acadiana Regional Airport in New Iberia, LA. This airport is located in a heavy industrial complex and surrounded by agricultural land. The Acadiana Regional Airport has an advantage over other types of airports because it is surrounded by land use compatible with airport operations. Additionally, it is situated near the Port of Iberia, which is home to more than 100 companies employing close to 5,000 people in industries such as construction, energy, equipment rental, and trucking. This would bolster Louisiana's economy, help working families, and improve America's ability to trade with the world. Louisiana's economy relies on the thriving maritime industry. In 2014 a study from the Transportation Institute showed that 54,850 maritime- related jobs contribute more than $11 billion annually to Louisiana's economy. One in every 83 Louisiana jobs is connected to the domestic maritime industry, nearly twice that of any other State. With ports along the Mississippi and Red Rivers, our State sees vessels of varying sizes and types. While loading cargo, these ships must drain ballast water that they have taken on to maintain the balance of the ship. This can have varying degrees of environmental effects, with costly and confusing State and Federal regulations making compliance difficult. Senator Rubio is sponsoring the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, which creates a uniform, enforceable, and scientifically based national standard on ballast water discharges. This is needed in order to simplify the highly complicated and overly burdensome patchwork of State and Federal regulations that are in place today. Everyone I talk to in Louisiana's maritime industry and also in the inland marine, which would take the agriculture products from States such as the State the Presiding Officer represents, says it is necessary for these regulations to be harmonized, and they emphasize the importance of passing this bill. I am a cosponsor of this bill, and I am glad to see that Senator Rubio has filed the amendment to the bill we are considering on the floor today. The FAA Reauthorization Act contains many measures that will protect Americans, improve our economy, and protect our environment. I urge all my fellow Senators to support the bill and these amendments. I yield the floor. Amendment No. 3512, as Modified Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Aviation safety, as much as all national security, must be of paramount importance. I am increasingly concerned with reports from across the country that Secure Identification Display Area, SIDA, badges have gone missing, either through loss or theft. These badges, which grant access to secure areas of airports, allow employees to bypass traditional security checkpoints and, in the wrong hands, can pose a considerable security threat. An amendment considered and adopted earlier today by the Senate, Thune amendment No. 3512, is aimed at addressing this problem and would implement additional accountability and oversight methods to ensure that these SIDA badges do not fall into the wrong hands. It would provide for further employer accountability and allow for increased fines and enforcement actions against workers that fail to report the loss or theft of a badge. These are well-intentioned goals and ones that I support. I opposed this amendment, however, because extraneous provisions included in the amendment directly contradict bipartisan efforts in this Congress to reform our criminal justice system, including by reducing unnecessary barriers to employment for people with criminal records. The amendment will require the TSA Administrator to propose increasing the lookback period from 10 years to 15 years for background checks of airport and airline workers who have or are seeking SIDA badges. Under current regulations, there are a number of offenses that disqualify a potential employee, if the individual was convicted of the offense during the 10-year lookback period. The amendment would also require the TSA Administrator to consider adding more offenses to the list of disqualifying crimes. Disqualifying offenses already include a number of low-level offenses, such as felony drug possession. These provisions would exacerbate barriers to reentry. The scope of the changes will still exclude many potential employees and lead to the firing of a number of current employees. [[Page S1794]] I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks a letter from Transport Workers Union of America, the AFL-CIO, the Association of Flight Attendants, CWA--the Communication Workers of America, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Transportation Trades Department--AFL-CIO, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Employment Law Project in opposition to this amendment. I am committed to working with Senator Thune to ensure greater accountability for Secure Identification Display Area badges. It must be a priority. I hope that he and others will work with me through the conference of this bill to eliminate these barriers to employment for individuals with certain criminal records. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: April 6, 2016. Oppose the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361) as an Amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act (H.R. 636) Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to oppose any efforts to expand background checks on aviation workers as proposed in the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361). In particular, we are opposed to the inclusion of S. 2361 as an amendment to H.R. 636, the FAA Reauthorization Act, which is currently under consideration in the Senate. As drafted, S. 2361 would undermine reforms around the nation that have reduced barriers to employment of people with criminal records, thus representing a serious setback for the bipartisan criminal justice reform movement. The Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act would alter the requirements for airport workers to obtain Secure Identification Display Area (SIDA) badges by instructing the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator to propose increasing the lookback period on many aviation workers' employment background checks from 10 years to 15 years. This provision undermines the goal of promoting rehabilitation, and it conflicts with the substantial research documenting that criminal history lookback periods should not extend back more than seven years. The bill also instructs the TSA Administrator to consider increasing disqualifying criminal offenses to include crimes that do not appear to be related to transportation security. These reforms would have far reaching impact and exacerbate barriers to reentry. As many as one in three Americans have a criminal record and nearly half of U.S. children have a parent with a criminal record, creating life-long barriers to opportunity, including employment, for entire families. This change will also have an overwhelming discriminatory impact on communities of color, who have been hardest hit by a flawed criminal justice system. Moreover, this proposal does not account for the compelling evidence documenting the impact of gainful employment on those who have previously been convicted of a crime. Full integration into society is essential to successful anti-terror programs and efforts to lower recidivism rates. By requiring the dismissal of many current employees who have worked in a position for years, the legislation ignores these widely accepted principles. We do support some elements of this legislation. The bill would create a waiver process for those who are denied credentials. This would ensure the consideration of circumstances from which it may be concluded that an individual does not pose a risk of terrorism or to security. The waiver process would consider the circumstances surrounding an offense, restitution, mitigation remedies, and other factors. This provision is modeled on a very successful program in the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), a credential that is similar to a SIDA, which is used at secure areas of port facilities. We strongly encourage you oppose the inclusion of any amendment providing blanket categorical exclusions that would increase background checks on aviation workers and act as additional barriers to the employment of people with criminal records. Thank you for your consideration. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Brendan Danaher, Director of Government Affairs at the Transport Workers Union, or Greg Regan, Senior Legislative Representative at the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO. Sincerely, Transport Workers Union of America. AFL-CIO. Association of Flight Attendants--CWA. Communication Workers of America. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. National Employment Law Project. Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO. VOTE EXPLANATION Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was absent from today's votes on three amendments to the pending business, H.R. 636, the vehicle for a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, due to events I attended with President Obama in Illinois. Had I been present, my votes would have been as follows. On rollcall vote No. 41, Thune amendment No. 3512, as modified, I would have voted against adoption. I am concerned about the impact that a provision in this amendment will have on formerly incarcerated individuals who have successfully reintegrated into society after completing sentences for low-level crimes unrelated to transportation security. The provision, which will make it more difficult for these individuals to obtain certain aviation jobs years after a criminal conviction, undermines efforts to reduce barriers to reentry, lower recidivism rates, and reform our criminal justice system. On rollcall vote No. 42, Heinrich amendment No. 3482, as modified, I would have voted in favor of adoption. This amendment will further strengthen the homeland by increasing security in soft targets at airports, in areas like check-ins and baggage claims, where terrorists recently carried out deadly attacks in Brussels. The amendment will expand and enhance visible deterrents, create a new eligible use under Homeland Security grants for training exercises to enhance preparedness for active shooter incidents, and authorize and make explicit that Homeland Security grants can be used for airport and surface transportation in these nonsecure soft target areas. I am proud to have cosponsored this amendment. On rollcall vote No. 43, Schumer amendment No. 3483, I would have voted in favor of adoption. This amendment would establish consumer safeguards like minimum standards for space for passengers on aircrafts, including the size and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room, and the width of aisles. As these votes demonstrate, after a series of temporary extensions, the Senate is finally considering a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. In light of recent threats both here and abroad, it is important that we get this right. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis on these important security reforms, consumer protections, and other pressing aviation-related issues in the coming days and weeks. Mr. CASSIDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so ordered. UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR Mr. McCONNELL.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_160.csv,144504,144504,144572,"[congressional record volume 162, number 53 (thursday, april 7, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1778-s1794] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] america's small business tax relief act of 2015 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of h.r. 636, which the clerk will report. the legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (h.r. 636) to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. pending: thune/nelson amendment no. 3464, in the nature of a substitute. thune (for gardner) amendment no. 3460 (to amendment no. 3464), to require the faa administrator to consider the operational history of a person before authorizing the person to operate certain unmanned aircraft systems. thune amendment no. 3512 (to amendment no. 3464), to enhance airport security. the presiding officer. the senator from florida. mr. nelson. mr. president, we have the faa bill on the floor. i would like to discuss some of the amendments that are proposed and, hopefully, a couple that we will be voting on this morning. there are a couple of amendments--one offered by senator thune on behalf of himself and this senator, the ranking member of the commerce committee, and another offered by senator heinrich. both amendments deal with the issue of security but in different arenas. let me explain. the thune-nelson amendment applies to the question of perimeter security, of allowing employees to get into an airport--not the sterile area controlled by tsa, although, as i will explain, it can definitely affect the sterile area as well. on the other hand, the heinrich amendment addresses security in the areas where passengers bunch up outside of tsa security, such as in a queue-up line going through tsa security, or passengers bunched up at the ticket counters, checking in their luggage. either way, as we saw from the experience of the brussels airport explosion, those are very tempting targets for a terrorist. therefore, the proposal in the heinrich amendment, which i would commend to the senate, is to increase the level of security, particularly with what are called vipr teams, which, in essence, are not only at airports but at seaports and at transportation hubs. remember that in brussels there was a bombing in one of the train stations as well. so we need to increase the surveillance and the security there, including dogs. as a matter of fact, our k-9 friends are some of the best that we have when it comes to protecting us because their noses are attuned to being able to sniff out the explosives that you cannot detect with metal detectors or with the ait machine that we go through where we hold up our hands to see if we have anything on us. it can detect if you have a package, if you have an explosive that is somewhere in one of your body cavities. it is going to be very, very difficult. dogs, because of their god-given sense of smell, can detect that. a properly trained dog is just amazing to watch. now, interestingly, concurrently there is research going on at nist, the national institute of standards and technology, for an artificial dog nose, a mechanical item or a piece of software and hardware that would actually do the same job. but that has not been perfected yet. that is going to be really interesting to see what they come up with. this senator will report to the senate later on that. but for the time being, the heinrich amendment, which i hope we will vote on this morning, is concerned with that security that we have seen as a result of the brussels bombing. we certainly want to enhance security in our airports. thank goodness we have the intelligence apparatus that we do in this country to be able to smoke out the terrorist before he ever does his dirty deed. it is more difficult for them to do it here in america than it is in europe because of the alienation of those communities that then harbor the terrorists. we see the result in brussels as well as paris. that is the heinrich amendment. that is a broad characterization of it, but basically that is the thrust. the thune-nelson amendment is going at the perimeter security. ok, think egypt and the russian airliner. it was an airport employee who smuggled the bomb onto the plane, not as a passenger but as an airport employee. think the atlanta airport, 2 years ago. in a gunrunning scheme over 3 months, over 100 guns were transported from atlanta to new york. the police in new york could not figure out how all of these guns were getting on the streets in new york. they kept checking the trains, and they kept checking the interstates. they could not figure it out. here is how they did it. an employee at the atlanta airport--because atlanta was not checking their employees--would smuggle the guns in. then that employee had access in the terminal to get into the sterile area--the tsa sterile area--and he would go into the men's room, meet the passenger who had already come through security and was clean, and give the guns to him to put them in his empty knapsack, his backpack. this employee, over the course of 17 times, over 3 months, smuggled over 100 guns. thank goodness it was a criminal enterprise, not a terrorist, because you can imagine what would have happened. the miami international airport 10 years ago figured this out. what they did was, instead of having hundreds of entry points into the airport for airport employees in a very large airport like atlanta, in miami they boiled it down to a handful. there the employees went through similar security that passengers do to check to see if they had any weapons. they had a special identification card that they would have to stick into an electronic machine and put in their code, which was another way of checking to make sure that the employee was who they said they were. miami solved the problem after having a problem with drugs 10 years ago. interestingly, in the interim, the orlando international airport, likewise, about 4 years ago had a similar drug problem. they did the same thing. they boiled down hundreds of entry points for airport employees to a handful. they had those checks. i have gone to see those checks at those two airports. that is exactly how they do it. the fact is, we have 300 airports in the united states. there were only two that were doing this kind of perimeter checking. atlanta then became the [[page s1779]] poster boy of what can happen in a gunrunning scheme. i am happy to report to the senate that, in fact, the atlanta airport has now done exactly what miami and orlando have done. but we have 297 other airports that need to do the same thing. so the thune-nelson amendment is exactly getting at that kind of perimeter security situation. i highly commend both the thune-nelson amendment as well as the heinrich amendment. there are a whole bunch of cosponsors--bipartisan--on each of these. i highly recommend both of these to the senate. i hope we will vote on those today--hopefully, this morning. now, there are going to be, of course, a series of many other amendments, some very well intentioned that have some technical glitches, and we have our very expert staff right now starting to try to work out some of these technical glitches. then we can get moving with this faa bill. i would mention one other amendment that this senator will be offering, and that is on a cyber security bill. did the presiding officer see the ``60 minutes'' segment where people with a laptop could take over an automobile by going through the electronics of the automobile? they can speed it up, they can make it stop it, and they can make it turn and completely take over the operation of an automobile. can the presiding officer imagine somebody being able to do that with an airliner with 250 people on board? therefore, whether we want to face it or not, we better face it because we are in an era that what we need to do is to make sure technically that the systems in an airliner are separate, that there is an air gap, and that whatever those systems are--it might be wi-fi for the airplane, it might be music, or it may be whatever it is--there is an air gap so that someone cannot go into that system and suddenly get into the aircraft controls. that is super important. one other thing i would mention is what we know as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. they have become quite popular. but, obviously, one of the things that is already in the bill, which senator thune and i have insisted on as we approach this faa bill, is that we have to come face-to-face with the reality that drones are now impairing the safety of an ascending or a descending aircraft. we have seen--the two of us--an operation where you can now take over the operation of a drone. education can do so much. people have to understand that you basically have to not fly a drone within 5 miles of an airport. just recently, at miami international airport, there was an inbound american airlines plane, and there was a drone about 1,000 feet off on the left side. remember captain sully sullenberger, when a flock of geese suddenly got sucked into the engines and all power was lost. fortunately, he had the hudson river that he could belly it in after he had taken off from laguardia. you put a drone with plastic and metal, let that get sucked into the engine, and you will have a catastrophic failure. you don't want to put your passengers in that kind of operation. therefore, education is one thing, but there is always going to be a young person that does not know about this. we don't know the answer. we know we can take over the operation of the drone, send it over here, have it set down, and have it land. the technology is there, but how do we apply that technology so we avoid this aircraft collision? there is an increasing use of drones that are so helpful for so many commercial purposes, not to mention the pure pleasure of flying a drone around, which we are seeing has become exceptionally popular. we address that in the bill by giving the appropriate direction to the faa to start coming up with the solutions of how we are going to protect aircraft in and around airports. on down the line, there are going to be so many different issues with regard to drones, far beyond the scope of the faa bill. on the question of privacy--a drone suddenly coming down and coming at eye level outside your bedroom window snooping--there are all kinds of questions about privacy. what about the fact that you can now put a gun on a drone? we know in a war zone we have the capability of doing that with very sophisticated weapons, such as hellfire missiles, but now some people are experimenting with putting a gun on a drone. we have the ramifications of what that means for society to deal with in the future. for the immediate future, the faa bill on the floor--we have this problem of avoiding drones colliding into aircraft, and that is in the bill and it is addressed. we have a lot of interesting issues to talk about. let's get the senate on it, and hopefully we can get agreement so we can at least vote on two of these amendments this morning. mr. president, i yield the floor. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. heinrich. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 3482, as modified, to amendment no. 3464 mr. heinrich. mr. president, i call up my amendment no. 3482, as modified, and ask that it be reported by number. the presiding officer. the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from new mexico [mr. heinrich] proposes an amendment numbered 3482, as modified, to amendment no. 3464. the amendment, as modified, is as follows: (purpose: to expand and enhance visible deterrents at major transportation hubs and to increase the resources to protect and secure the united states) at the end of title v, insert the following: sec. 5032. visible deterrent. section 1303 of the implementing recommendations of the 9/ 11 commission act of 2007 (6 u.s.c. 1112) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (a) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a semicolon; (b) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (c) by adding at the end the following: ``(5) if the vipr team is deployed to an airport, shall require, as appropriate based on risk, that the vipr team conduct operations-- ``(a) in the sterile area and any other areas to which only individuals issued security credentials have unescorted access; and ``(b) in non-sterile areas.''; and (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2007 through 2011'' and inserting ``such sums as necessary, including funds to develop not more than 60 vipr teams, for fiscal years 2016 through 2017''. sec. 5033. law enforcement training for mass casualty and active shooter incidents. section 2006(a)(2) of the homeland security act of 2002 (6 u.s.c. 607(a)(2)) is amended-- (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (e) through (i) as subparagraphs (f) through (j), respectively; and (2) by inserting after subparagraph (d) the following: ``(e) training exercises to enhance preparedness for and response to mass casualty and active shooter incidents and security events at public locations, including airports and mass transit systems;''. sec. 5034. assistance to airports and surface transportation systems. section 2008(a) of the homeland security act of 2002 (6 u.s.c. 609(a)) is amended-- (1) by redesigning paragraphs (9) through (13) as paragraphs (10) through (14), respectively; and (2) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following: ``(9) enhancing the security and preparedness of secure and non-secure areas of eligible airports and surface transportation systems.''. the presiding officer. the senator from new mexico. mr. heinrich. mr. president, this amendment would strengthen u.s. airport security, especially in nonsecure or soft-target areas of airports--places such as check-in and baggage claim areas. it would also update federal security programs to provide active shooter training for law enforcement and increase the presence of federal agents with bomb-sniffing canines at these nonsecure areas. i thank the cosponsors of the amendment: senator manchin, senator schumer, senator nelson, senator klobuchar, senator cantwell, senator carper, senator baldwin, senator durbin, senator bennet, and senator blumenthal. i urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the adoption of this amendment. i yield the floor. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. [[page s1780]] the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. casey. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. rubio). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. casey. mr. president, i wish to speak on the bill and ask consent to do so. the presiding officer. the senator is recognized. mr. casey. mr. president, i am pleased to be joined by my colleague from pennsylvania senator toomey to talk about an issue we began to discuss on the floor yesterday, but we have been working many months on this issue. it is a rather simple issue, but it is a matter that has some real urgency connected to it because we are talking about a secondary barrier on airplanes--meaning a barrier other than what we know now to be a reinforced cockpit door--to prevent terrorists from getting into the cockpit. what we need to do in addition to that, after congress mandated the installation of these reinforced cockpit doors, is add a secondary barrier. this is something that arises because we not only know from the attack on 9/11 but thereafter, we know that, no. 1, this is still an intention that terrorists have to take over an airplane. we know since 9/11, 51-- i will correct the record from yesterday, i think i said 15, i had transposed the number--but it is 51 hijacking attempts around the world since 9/11. this is not a problem that is going away, and we have to deal with it. this is the barrier we are talking about. so people understand the nature of this barrier, this is a lightweight wire mesh gate that would prevent a terrorist from getting into the cockpit or even getting to the door of the cockpit, which, as we said, is already reinforced. what it does fundamentally is block access to the flight deck. that is what we are talking about. that is what our amendment does. we know the substantial number of groups that support this. i will just read the list for the record. and this actually is support for the underlying bill that senator toomey and i and others have been working on for a while. the underlying bill itself was s. 911. also, the amendment, amendment no. 3458, is endorsed by the following groups: the airline pilots association, the allied pilots association, the association of flight attendants, the federal law enforcement officers association, the us airline pilots association, the coalition of airline pilots association, the port authority of new york & new jersey, and families of september 11. there have been numerous studies done. i am holding a study--although you can't see it from a distance--which was conducted by the cato institute, among others, on terrorism risk and cost-benefit analysis of aviation security. so we not only have substantial support from virtually every group you could point toward, but we have some expertise on how to protect pilots in the cockpit, how to protect passengers on an airplane, and, of course, how to do that by preventing terrorists from getting through or near the cockpit because of a good secondary barrier. this effort started literally from folks we now know in pennsylvania. it started with, among other people, the saracini family, ellen saracini, the wife of captain victor saracini, who piloted united flight 175, which terrorists hijacked and flew into the world trade center on 9/11. so in memory of captain saracini and inspired by the great work of his wife ellen saracini, we offer this amendment. again, i am very pleased to be working on this with my colleague senator toomey, and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from pennsylvania. mr. toomey. mr. president, i would like to underscore the points made by my colleague senator casey. i thank him for his leadership. this is a very simple matter that is very straightforward and common sense. we know there is a very real vulnerability in our commercial aircraft. we know this. there is no mystery here. and we have a very simple, affordable, reasonable solution that will provide the security we need. after september 11, 2001, congress very rightly mandated that the cockpit door be reinforced so that it is virtually impossible to destroy that door, to knock down that door, to defeat the purpose of that door when it is closed and latched. the problem is that when it is open--which it must be open periodically during many flights--a very strong door is useless. we know what happens now on airlines because we have all witnessed it, right? when a pilot needs to come out or go in or there is access to the cockpit when that door is open, the flight attendant rolls a little serving cart in front of the door. i suppose that is better than nothing, but it is not much better than nothing. that cart can be rolled away. we are not the only ones who have observed this. an faa advisory has observed this risk. the 9/11 commission pointed out that the terrorists were very focused on the opportunity created by the opening of the cockpit door. as senator casey pointed out, there have been multiple attempts to breach that door. several have been successful. we have an amendment that solves this problem in a very affordable, reasonable, sensible way. it is a lightweight, collapsible barrier made of wire mesh, and a flight attendant can simply draw it across the opening, lock it, and then at that point the cockpit door can be opened and there is no way someone would be able to rush through that wire mesh in time to get to the cockpit during that moment when the door is open. that is what our amendment does. it passed the transportation committee in the house unanimously. as senator casey pointed out, it has very broad support from many of the stakeholders who care about the security of our commercial aviation. it is our hope and understanding that we will be very soon propounding a unanimous consent agreement which will allow this amendment to be pending and that this will be one of the amendments which will be on the docket for a subsequent vote. i hope we will get to that momentarily. i hope we will get that locked in, and then i would urge my colleagues to vote yes on our amendment and enhance commercial aviation safety. i yield the floor. mr. thune. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mrs. fischer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mrs. fischer. mr. president, i rise to discuss an important matter before the senate, the reauthorization of our nation's federal aviation administration. the faa is tasked with a critical mission to manage the safety and the security of our nation's airspace. our nation's airspace is an incredible resource that fuels our economy. according to the bureau of transportation statistics, in 2015, a record 896 million passengers traversed america's skies. our aviation system contributes $1.5 trillion to our nation's economy and it supports 11.8 million jobs for hard-working americans, as noted by the national air traffic controllers association. the senate's faa reauthorization bill will make our aviation system stronger for families, children, veterans, and the traveling public. it will also benefit nebraska's rural airports and local aviation stakeholders. notably, this carefully negotiated bill will strengthen america's aviation system without raising fees or taxes on airline passengers. our robust, bipartisan legislation includes several major priorities i championed. i am proud of bipartisan language i worked to include in the bill, along with senators booker, cantwell, and ayotte. our provision would compel the faa to work with the airline industry to comprehensively assess and update guidelines for emergency medical kits on commercial aircraft. these kits, which haven't been statutorily updated since 1998, provide lifesaving resources for passengers. it is well past time for the faa to evaluate medications and equipment included in these kits. doing so will ensure all passengers, [[page s1781]] particularly families with young infants facing unknown allergic reactions, have access to the medical supplies they might need in an emergency situation. in addition, i worked with senator mccaskill to include an amendment that would make it easier for traveling mothers to care for their young infants. our amendment unanimously passed the commerce committee. we worked closely with airport stakeholders, including omaha's eppley airfield, to establish reasonable minimum standards for both medium- and large-hub airports to develop private rooms for nursing mothers in future capital development plans. traveling as a new mom can be challenging and it can be stressful at times, but i believe this important change will provide increased flexibility and also peace of mind for mothers traveling through airports across our country. i also joined senator hirono to include an amendment that would ensure disabled veterans working at the faa have access to service- connected disability leave. the faa was one of the few agencies not included in the recently passed wounded warriors federal leave act. that bill required federal agencies to ensure disabled vets have access to service-connected disability leave. our disabled veterans bravely served our country, and they deserve access to benefits they have earned. i am grateful for the achievements this bill will advance for the flying public. at the same time, the bill is also a victory for nebraska's rural communities and airports. the small airport regulation relief act, which is included in the faa bill, would create a temporary exemption for small airports so they can continue to receive airport improvement program funds--those aip funds--despite downturns in air service. the survival of smaller airports, such as scottsbluff's western nebraska regional airport, depends on these crucial funds to provide service to local passengers and businesses. several of nebraska's small and community airports, such as alliance, chadron, grand island, mccook, north platte, and scottsbluff, will also benefit from a continuation of the essential air service, or eas, program. the eas program incentivizes air carriers to provide service to underserved and rural areas, and it is critical to ensuring air service continues for nebraska's rural communities. meanwhile, the central nebraska regional airport in grand island is growing and hosts a privately operated federal contract tower. i encouraged the inclusion of provisions to compel the faa to complete a pending cost-benefit analysis for federal contract tower airports. this analysis would reflect the cost-share arrangement more accurately between our local airports and the faa for those contract towers. through this legislation, we can help to reduce the burden on local airports such as grand island, ne. one of the major challenges facing aviation manufacturers has been the faa's inconsistent and often unclear regulatory process. i collaborated with duncan aviation of lincoln, ne, the largest family- owned maintenance, repair, and overhaul organization in the world, to address this challenge. in fact, chairman thune toured the facilities at duncan aviation with me in lincoln last fall. our bill would provide clarity to aviation businesses like duncan aviation by compelling the faa to establish a centralized safety guidance database. moreover, the bill would require the faa to establish a regulatory consistency communications board. the board would set standards to ensure the consistent application of regulations and guidance at regional offices throughout our country. agricultural aviators in nebraska will also benefit from safety enhancements in this bill. far too many of our agricultural pilots have died in recent years after collisions with unmarked utility towers. this legislation would ensure that towers are marked to create safer skies for our agriculture pilots. passing our faa bill will be a major accomplishment for the senate. i appreciate and commend the hard work of chairman thune, ranking member nelson, and their committee staffers on this meaningful faa reauthorization bill. in the coming days, i look forward to working together to help pass this critical legislation that will benefit the flying public, our national aviation system, and nebraska's rural airports and aviation stakeholders. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. thune. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. thune. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that my amendment numbered 3512 be modified with the changes at the desk and that at 12:05 p.m. today the senate vote on the following amendments in the order listed: thune no. 3512, as modified; and heinrich no. 3482, as modified; further that at 1:45 p.m. today the senate vote on the schumer amendment no. 3483 and that no second-degree amendments be in order to any of the amendments prior to the vote and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment (no. 3512), as modified, is as follows: at the appropriate place, insert the following: title ___--transportation security and terrorism prevention subtitle a--airport security enhancement and oversight act sec. _101. short title. this subtitle may be cited as the ``airport security enhancement and oversight act''. sec. _102. findings. congress makes the following findings: (1) a number of recent airport security breaches in the united states have involved the use of secure identification display area (referred to in this section as ``sida'') badges, the credentials used by airport and airline workers to access the secure areas of an airport. (2) in december 2014, a delta ramp agent at hartsfield- jackson atlanta international airport was charged with using his sida badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a number of months via commercial aircraft. (3) in january 2015, an atlanta-based aviation safety inspector of the federal aviation administration used his sida badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and transport a firearm in his carry-on luggage. (4) in february 2015, a local news investigation found that over 1,000 sida badges at hartsfield-jackson atlanta international airport were lost or missing. (5) in march 2015, and again in may 2015, transportation security administration contractors were indicted for participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed through the secure area of the san francisco international airport. (6) the administration has indicated that it does not maintain a list of lost or missing sida badges, and instead relies on airport operators to track airport worker credentials. (7) the administration rarely uses its enforcement authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain threshold of missing sida badges. (8) in april 2015, the aviation security advisory committee issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access control. (9) in june 2015, the inspector general of the department of homeland security reported that the administration did not have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers who had records in united states intelligence-related databases because the administration was not authorized to receive all terrorism-related information under current interagency watchlisting policy. (10) the inspector general also found that the administration did not have appropriate checks in place to reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment investigations, including criminal history record checks and work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight over the airport operators that the administration relies on to perform criminal history and work authorization checks for airport workers. (11) there is growing concern about the potential insider threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities. sec. _103. definitions. in this subtitle: (1) administration.--the term ``administration'' means the transportation security administration. (2) administrator.--the term ``administrator'' means the administrator of the transportation security administration. (3) appropriate committees of congress.--the term ``appropriate committees of congress'' means-- (a) the committee on commerce, science, and transportation of the senate; [[page s1782]] (b) the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs of the senate; and (c) the committee on homeland security of the house of representatives. (4) asac.--the term ``asac'' means the aviation security advisory committee established under section 44946 of title 49, united states code. (5) secretary.--the term ``secretary'' means the secretary of homeland security. (6) sida.--the term ``sida'' means secure identification display area as defined in section 1540.5 of title 49, code of federal regulations, or any successor regulation to such section. sec. _104. threat assessment.

on this issue. we worked very hard on a series of security bills that we could bring to the floor. we are trying to move them separately, but i think they fit nicely into the debate we are having on the faa reauthorization. senators nelson, ayotte, cantwell, and i have been leading oversight of airport and airline workers abusing their secure area access badges. this oversight led our committee to approve bipartisan legislation--s. 2361, airport security enhancement and oversight act--to tighten the vetting of airport workers with ties to terrorists and serious criminal behavior that should disqualify them from accessing sensitive airport areas. just in the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry workers have been caught in the act of helping criminal organizations. on march 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of cocaine after being confronted by transportation security officers in california. on march 26 in florida, an airline gate agent was arrested with a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand off to an associate. as we work to address the threat of an aviation insider helping terrorists, [[page s1786]] criminals who break laws for financial gain and those with a history of violence are a really good place to start. it is high time that we start cracking down on these types of offenses for people who are working in sensitive areas of our airports. u.s. terrorism experts believe that isis is recruiting criminals to join its ranks in europe, and some of the perpetrators in the deadly attacks in brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals. ensuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy is especially important, considering that experts believe an isis affiliate may have planted a bomb on a russian metrojet flight leaving egypt with the help of an airport employee, which killed 224 people on board. the recent attacks by isis in the unsecured area of the brussels airport also underscore the vulnerability of airport areas outside of tsa security screening checkpoints. the house of representatives and the commerce committee also approved legislation--h.r. 2843, the precheck expansion act--in december of 2015 to expand the precheck program by developing private sector partnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. these private sector partners would be required to use an assessment equivalent to a fingerprint-based criminal history record check conducted through the fbi. these changes would increase the number of passengers who are vetted before they get to the airport. as a result, more passengers would receive expedited airport screening and get through security checkpoints more quickly, ensuring they don't pose the kind of easy target that the isis suicide bombers exploited at the brussels airport. in addition to the bills approved by our committee on march 23, the house homeland security committee approved h.r. 4698, the safe gates act of 2016, which would strengthen security at international airports with direct flights to the united states. specifically, the bill would require tsa to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of all last- point-of-departure airports, a security coordination enhancement plan, and a workforce assessment. it would authorize the tsa to donate security screening equipment to foreign last-point-of-departure airports and to evaluate foreign countries' air cargo security programs to prevent any shipment of nefarious materials via air cargo. i believe these bills will help make air travel more secure, and they should advance in the full senate in this amendment to the faa bill. i encourage my colleagues to support the thune-nelson amendment and then also follow-on with the heinrich amendment, which will come up shortly after a vote on that amendment. i think the heinrich amendment also makes a number of important security improvements that will also strengthen airport security. there has been a discussion about whether there ought to be more vipr teams. i think there are 30 or so at this point, and the amendment would allow that number to go up to 60. yesterday we had the opportunity to question the tsa administrator, admiral neffenger, about whether additional vipr teams would be useful. he said they could put to use anything they were given in terms of additional units that might be deployed to places around the country where they think there is a need. so that is the principal component of the heinrich amendment, which also addresses some of the security issues. i don't think we can understate how important security is in light of everything that is going on in the world today. we have people who want to harm americans, and it is our job to make sure we are giving those authorities who are there to prevent those types of attacks against americans all the tools they need in order to do their jobs effectively. i encourage our colleagues here in the senate--when we have an opportunity to vote here momentarily on both of these security amendments--to support those amendments. they improve and strengthen security at our airports around this country, and i think they fit nicely within the context of the faa reauthorization bill and the debate we are currently having on the floor of the u.s. senate. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senior senator from florida. amendment no. 3483 to amendment no. 3464 mr. nelson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to call up schumer amendment no.

reading of the amendment be dispensed with. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to require the federal aviation administration to establish minimum standards for space for passengers on passenger aircraft) at the end of subtitle a of title iii, add the following: sec. 3124. regulations relating to space for passengers on aircraft. (a) moratorium on reductions to aircraft seat size.--not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this act, the administrator of the federal aviation administration shall prohibit any air carrier from reducing the size, width, padding, or pitch of seats on passenger aircraft operated by the air carrier, the amount of leg room per seat on such aircraft, or the width of aisles on such aircraft. (b) regulations relating to space for passengers on aircraft.--not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this act, the administrator shall prescribe regulations-- (1) establishing minimum standards for space for passengers on passenger aircraft, including the size, width, padding, and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room per seat, and the width of aisles on such aircraft for the safety, health, and comfort of passengers; and (2) requiring each air carrier to prominently display on the website of the air carrier the amount of space available for each passenger on passenger aircraft operated by the air carrier, including the size, width, padding, and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room per seat, and the width of aisles on such aircraft. (c) consultations.--in prescribing the regulations required by subsection (b), the administrator shall consult with the occupational safety and health administration, the centers for disease control and prevention, passenger advocacy organizations, physicians, and ergonomic engineers. (d) air carrier defined.--in this section, the term ``air carrier'' means an air carrier (as defined in section 40102 of title 49, united states code) that transports passengers by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation. mr. nelson. mr. president, in just 5 minutes we will have our first series of votes on amendments on this bill. this is a good start to the faa bill. it is improving the underlying bill that has a lot of attention to security already in it. but these are clearly amendments that will improve the bill. i spoke about it earlier today. i certainly commend these amendments to the senate. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mrs. fischer). the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. thune. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. vote on amendment no. 3512, as modified. the presiding officer. under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment no. 3512, as modified, offered by the senator from south dakota. mr. thune. madam president, i yield back whatever time remains. the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified. mr. thune. madam president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk called the roll. mr. thune. the following senators are necessarily absent: the senator from texas (mr. cornyn) and the senator from texas (mr. cruz). further, if present and voting the senator from texas (mr. cornyn) would have voted ``yea.''

[[page s1788]] it is difficult to overstate the importance of these statements uttered just a few months ago. the u.s. dollar is the standard currency in which international trade is conducted. because the ayatollahs can't deal in dollars, they haven't fully opened their economy to the world-- thankfully. in addition, the u.s. financial system hasn't yet been tainted by iran's terror financing, its international aggression, and its crackdown on domestic democratic dissent. but now, a mere 7 months into a 15-year agreement, the obama administration is shedding the resolve its officials tried to so hard to display before congress. according to numerous reports, the administration intends to backtrack on the statements of secretary lew and adam szubin. it is looking for some way, somehow to give iran access to u.s. dollars to boost iranian trade and investment. i want to be very clear. if the president moves to grant iran access to the u.s. dollar--whether directly or indirectly--there will be consequences. if there is any statement, guidance, regulation, or executive action that opens the u.s. banking sector to iran even a crack, the senate will hold hearings with each official who assured the american people last summer that the ayatollahs would never access the dollar. we will explore whether they lied back then or whether they intend to resign in protest now. if this policy change moves forward, i will dedicate myself to working with my colleagues to pass legislation blocking the change. if the obama administration proceeds with this massive concession to the ayatollahs, every member of the senate who voted to accept the iranian deal will have to go home and explain why the u.s. economy is now complicit in iran's financing of terrorist attacks against americans and american allies. that the obama administration would even consider allowing iran access to the u.s. banking sector is extremely disconcerting, but it is not surprising. it follows a steady pattern that has become increasingly clear since the conclusion of the nuclear deal. time and again, iran provokes the united states, commits brazen acts to destabilize its neighbors, and threatens to undo the iran deal. in response, the united states rushes to grant the ayatollahs more concessions in order to placate them. iran has tested ballistic missiles, captured u.s. sailors, and fueled conflicts in syria and yemen with fresh arms and troops--all while employing ``death to america'' as a rallying cry. but in the face of iran's continued aggression, the president has displayed only weakness. instead of steeling himself for a fight with the ayatollahs, he has laid down and rolled over for them. he has repeatedly refused to designate iran's tests of ballistic missiles as the violations of u.n. security council resolutions they so clearly are. the president also agreed to send an additional $1.7 billion to the ayatollahs, ostensibly to settle outstanding claims. for good measure, that $1.7 billion includes $1.3 billion in gratuitous interest payments. the president granted clemency to seven convicted iranian criminals and dismissed arrest warrants for 14 iranian fugitives who faced charges for sanctions violations. now the president may be on the verge of granting the largest concession yet--dollarizing iran's international trade and declaring iran truly open for business. we should call this for what it is--concession creep. in the same manner that no member of the senate should trust iran to abide by its commitments made in the iranian nuclear deal, we can no longer trust the administration to hold fast to the specific concessions contained in the four corners of that deal. the ink is hardly dry on the deal, and the president has already shown himself all too susceptible to the temptations of appeasement. the ayatollahs reportedly have complained to u.s. officials that it is too hard to transact business without access to u.s. dollars. the answer to that should be ``too bad.'' it should not be easy for the world's worst sponsor of terrorism to do business with the global economy. it should not be easy for industries dominated by the iranian revolutionary guard corps to trade in financial markets. international business leaders, directors, ceos, and general counsels should not rush into iran for fear of the grave reputational, financial, political, and legal consequences of doing business with this outlaw regime. the iranians know the obama administration is desperate to preserve the nuclear deal. they hold the possibility of walking away from the agreement as a sword of damocles over the president's head in order to extract concession after concession. they lord it over him in order to forestall any u.s. action that would meaningfully stop their regional aggression and campaign of terror. so intense is president obama's fear that the ayatollah will rip up the nuclear agreement, he has completely upended u.s. strategy in the middle east to the point where adversaries are allies and allies are becoming adversaries. this parade of concessions must stop, and it must stop now. the administration must fully implement all new sanctions passed by congress to punish iran's development of ballistic missiles, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its human rights abuses. it must work with our traditional allies in the middle east to neutralize iran's attempt to foment instability throughout the region. the president should issue a very clear order that iran will not be granted any direct or indirect access to the u.s. banking system and the dollar. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from oregon. (the remarks of mr. merkley pertaining to the introduction of s. 2760 are printed in today's record under ``statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions.'') mr. merkley. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. amendment no. 3490 to amendment no. 3464 ms. cantwell. mr. president, i call up my amendment no. 3490. the presiding officer. the clerk will report. the legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from washington [ms. cantwell] proposes an amendment numbered 3490 to amendment no. 3464. ms. cantwell. i ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to extend protections against physical assault to air carrier customer service representatives) strike section 5009 and insert the following: sec. 5009. interference with air carrier employees. (a) in general.--section 46503 is amended by inserting after ``to perform those duties'' the following ``, or who assaults an air carrier customer representative in an airport, including a gate or ticket agent, who is performing the duties of the representative or agent,''. (b) conforming amendment.--section 46503 is amended in the section heading by inserting ``or air carrier customer representatives'' after ``screening personnel''. (c) clerical amendment.--the analysis for chapter 465 is amended by striking the item relating to section 46503 and inserting the following: ``46503. interference with security screening personnel or air carrier customer representatives.''. ms. cantwell. mr. president, i call up this amendment and offer it because the issue is making sure that those who work in the air transportation system are safe and secure. this is an important issue to the men and women who work at sea-tac and at other airports and are part of the delivery system of making sure air transportation is safe. they are an integral part of air transportation at every airport in the united states of america. this issue is something that has been considered in the house of representatives as part of the transportation package as well, and it is part of what we think should be in this package in the senate; that is, making sure that those who are part of the delivery system--ticket counter agents, agents who are aiding and assisting in getting passengers through the terminals and onto planes at the gate, assisting, as many of the challenging days go by, in delivering good air transportation service. what has happened is that these individuals have become victims--the victims of physical, violent abuse; that is, the public has taken to bodily harm against these individuals. so this amendment puts in similar safeguards [[page s1789]] that are in line with other transportation officials who are protected from this kind of physical abuse. i will have more to say on it, but i know my colleague is trying to get to the floor to speak as well. i will put into the record examples of individuals who are ticketing agents, baggage agents, air transportation delivery system workers who have been hurt, and they deserve to have protection. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. schumer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 3483 mr. schumer. mr. president, i rise today to urge a ``yes'' vote on the upcoming amendment to require the faa to set a minimum standard seat size. this amendment would ensure that airlines can't keep chopping down on seat size and legroom until consumers are packed in like sardines in a can on every flight. over the last few decades, between the size of the seat and the distance between the seats, the flying public has lost half a foot of their space. flying is not pleasant anymore. you are crammed in. i am not that tall--a little under 6-foot-1. what i do when i fly is i take out the magazine and the air-sickness bag and the little folder that shows you where the exits are to gain one-sixteenth of an inch more legroom. moms with kids have a lot of trouble in those very narrow seats. have you ever been in the situation where you are in the middle and there are two sort of large people on either side of you? it is not the most pleasant flying experience. we don't have too much competition anymore. we have very few airlines. this is a place where the public is clamoring for change. when i said i was going to offer this amendment, i got more feedback on it than most other things. and you don't have to be 6-foot-4 to understand the problem. you would think that by cramming in more and more passengers on each flight, the airlines could lower their prices. instead, several major airlines went in the other direction: they started charging for the extra inches and legroom that were once considered standard. so it practically costs you an arm and a leg just to have space for your arms and legs. at a time when airlines are making record profits, at a time when fuel costs are extremely low, we need this amendment to protect consumers' safety and comfort. this amendment would do three things. it doesn't set a standard seat size; it freezes the current seat size in place so they can't shrink it any further. it directs the faa to set minimum standard seat size and pitch for all commercial flights. and some of this involves comfort, but some of it involves safety. god forbid there is something terrible happening on a plane--the seats are so narrow, it is harder for people to get out. finally, we focus on transparency. we require airlines to post their seat sizes on their web sites, providing at least a commercial incentive for airlines to offer more comfortable seat arrangements. most folks travel under the expectation that the airlines are going to set the guidelines and that is that; there is nothing they can do about it. we actually had to put in the underlying bill that airlines should refund bag fees charged to consumers if the airline lost their bags. and i would say to my good friends on the other side, if we can mandate that bag fees be returned--not leave it up to the free market-- we can mandate that the faa at least set a proper seat size. they can't say: well, leave it up to the free market on one but not on the other. it is not a little fair. now we see why we need these amendments. the bag fee--and i agree that if they lose your bags or delay your bags, they shouldn't keep the extra bag fee. it should be refunded. in most industries, that would be a standard practice. if you fail to deliver a service somebody paid for, they should get their money back. but sometimes in the airline industry you have to require basic courtesy. in conclusion, the great abraham lincoln was once asked how long a man's legs should be, and he famously answered: long enough to reach from the body to the ground. if you asked a major airline today how long a man's legs should be, they would say: short enough to miss the tray table. that is no way to fly. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and move this bill in a more consumer-friendly direction. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. schumer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. schumer. mr. president, some of my colleagues have to catch planes, and it takes extra time for them to squeeze into those small seats with no legroom. so i yield back my time, and i ask unanimous consent that we move the vote up to right now. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. the question is on agreeing to amendment no. 3483. mr. schumer. i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk called the roll. mr. thune. the following senators are necessarily

portman. mr. president, i rise today to urge my colleagues in the house of representatives to pass the legislation we passed here in the senate a few weeks ago called the comprehensive addiction and recovery act, or cara. we passed it on march 10, which was 27 days ago--almost a month. it is estimated that we lose about 120 americans every day to drug overdoses. that means that during that time period--those 27 days--we lost about 3,240 additional americans who we represent to substance abuse and death from heroin and prescription drug overdoses. since 2007, drug overdoses have killed more people in ohio than any other cause of accidental death, even surpassing car accidents. it is probably [[page s1790]] true nationally now as well. addiction is treatable, but 9 out of 10 people who need treatment aren't getting it. that is a tragedy. it shows that the system we have right now just isn't working, and that is what our legislation addresses, among other things. in one 5-day span since we passed cara, just in the last month, we had five people die from heroin and fentanyl overdoses in one of the cities i represent-- cleveland, oh. i was in athens, oh, more than 2 weeks after we passed cara, and received a tour of the rural women's addiction recovery bassett house facility. dr. joe gay and ruth tarter took me around so i could meet some of the brave women who stepped forward to treat their addiction issues. some of them were there with their kids. they have an amazing success rate. i will tell you that 3 days after i left athens, oh, $40,000 of heroin was seized at a traffic stop very close to this treatment facility. it is everywhere. it knows no zip code. it is in rural areas, suburban areas, and inner cities. states are starting to take action. ohio is taking action, your states are taking action, and communities are taking action. local leaders know this is a problem, but they want the federal government to be a better partner. that is what cara provides. it provides best practices from around the country. it provides more funding for some critical elements that are evidence- based--based on research and what actually works. our states and local communities are desperate for this right now. by the way, this legislation is not just bipartisan. it is also bicameral. in other words, not only have republicans and democrats worked across the aisle here in the senate over the last 3 years putting this bill together, but our colleagues in the house have worked together as well. i am encouraged by the fact that the cara legislation in the house has 113 cosponsors. it is bipartisan. it is based on good evidence. it is based on a lot of work and effort. today i heard through a media account that one of the house leaders said there is interest in moving something even this month. that is great. but he also talked about hearings and markups and so on. let's be sure the hearings and markups don't delay what we know we should do, which is to pass the cara legislation. it has been bicameral and bipartisan. it passed the senate with a 94-to-1 vote. that never happens around here-- 94 to 1. this is legislation which we know will make a difference right now in our communities that are dealing with a crisis we all face. let's move this legislation. i say to my friends in the house with all due respect, this legislation has been carefully crafted and we have done the hard work. i mentioned that we spent 3 years of factfinding on this bill. we didn't think we had all the right answers, so we went out to experts all over the country. we took time to listen. we consulted with them. we listened to experts, doctors, law enforcement, and patients in recovery. we listened to the drug experts in the obama administration, such as the white house office of national drug control policy, ondcp. they have been very helpful. we brought in people from health and human services and listened to them. we brought in people from my home state of ohio and other states around the country. we heard from family members, many of whom have channelled their grief at losing a loved one into advocacy for the cara legislation because they know it is going to help. one testified in the judiciary committee when we marked up the legislation. tonda dare from carrollton, oh, talked about having lost her daughter, who was a very successful high school student and engaged to be married. everything was going great. when she turned 21, she made a mistake: she tried heroin. she went into recovery. she relapsed. she ended up dying of an overdose. unfortunately, this is a story that is retold all over our country. there are moms, there are dads, there are aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters who come forward to tell us these tragic stories about losing a loved one. they want this legislation to pass because they know it is going to help another family member or a friend or a coworker or someone whom they have never met but whom they want to help so they don't have to go through the grief they have gone through. senator sheldon whitehouse--a democrat--and i have worked on this legislation together, along with many other people in this chamber. we have also worked, as i said, with many on the house side. we worked with folks on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the capitol because this has become an issue that affects us all. it is a nonpartisan issue. we have to move it forward. we held five forums here in washington, dc, and brought in experts to get counsel and advice. they helped us develop a legislative proposal that was thoughtful because it actually addressed the real problem. in april 2014, we had a forum on the criminal justice system which included alternatives to incarceration, and you will see that in our legislation. the notion is, for users who get arrested for possession, let's not just throw them in jail because that hasn't worked. let's get them into treatment and get them into a recovery program that works. in july 2014, we held a forum on how women are impacted by this drug epidemic, looking particularly at addiction and treatment responses. some new data that is out there now shows that most of the people who are suffering from heroin and prescription drug addiction are women. in december 2014, we held a forum on the science of addiction--how we could get at this from a medical point of view, how we could come up with better medical approaches to this to be able to stop the craving, to deal with the addiction problem, to get people through withdrawal. we also talked about how to address some of the collateral consequences of addiction. in april of 2015, we held a forum on our youth and how we can better promote drug prevention. after all, keeping people from getting into the funnel of addiction in the first place has to be a priority. to help people avoid going down that funnel of addiction, we need better prevention, better education. that is part of our legislation. we also had input about what is working in recovery and what is not working in recovery. we held a forum in july of 2015 to talk about our veterans, to talk about the very sad situation with veterans who are coming back to our shores who have ptsd--post-traumatic stress disorder--and who have brain injuries. some recent data shows that about 20 percent of returning veterans with those issues are becoming addicted to prescription drugs or heroin; therefore, veterans courts are a major part of our legislation. these are drug courts that are focused on mental health and addiction specifically for our veterans. i have seen them in ohio. they are working great. it is unbelievable. i talked to a guy who has been in and out of the system his whole life. he is about 45 years old now. he finally found this court that was going to help him--took him out of jail and got him into treatment. hanging over his head was the possibility of incarceration if he didn't do the right thing and stay clean. he is now a senior at ohio state university and is about to get his degree, and he reunited with his family for the first time in many years. he is clean. it can work. the final result was the legislative text that reflected this open and deliberative process i am talking about. this bill--just like the research it supports--is evidence-based. we didn't ask who had the idea; we just asked whether it was a good idea. it is no wonder that cara now has support from 130 national groups, from the fraternal order of police, to stakeholders in public health-- doctors and nurses, those in recovery, experts in the field, people who actually know what is going on because they are in the trenches working on this. they want this bill passed. they know it will help them and help them now. as i said, that vote was 94 to 1, which means 94 senators say this bill is ready to go. these are senators from every state in the union who support this legislation, therefore representing every congressional district in the united states of america. it makes sense. it expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent opiate abuse, the use of heroin and prescription drugs. it increases drug-disposal sites to get medications out of people's hands and get it into the right hands. it takes [[page s1791]] this medication off the bathroom shelves. it has a drug-monitoring program to get at the overprescribing issue. so many people who are currently addicted to heroin started with prescription drugs. in fact, the majority did. there is different data out there, but it is very clear that prescription drugs are a huge part of heroin addiction. it also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and meth. law enforcement has an important role to play here. it expands training and the availability of naloxone, or narcan, to law enforcement. this is for our firefighters. when you go to a firehouse in your state--for those listening in the house, in your district--ask them: are you going on more fire runs or are you going on more runs to help people with overdoses? they will tell you what they tell me: overdoses. that is what it has come to. that is happening in your fire department in your community. by the way, to tell you how much this law can make a difference-- because we do help get the training for them to be able to use narcan and get the narcan or naloxone into the right hands--ohio public safety officials have administered naloxone over 16,000 times since 2015-- 16,000 overdoses that might otherwise have resulted in death. for the most part, this miracle drug works. first responders know how important it is. that is why the fraternal order of police supports this bill. they want to equip their officers, but so do the firefighters. cara also supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. to avoid people getting into addiction in the first place, it also creates a national task force on recovery because there is a lot of information out there we need to bring together to find out what works and what doesn't work precisely in terms of dealing with the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. cara expands treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies who suffer from what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. what does that mean? that means babies who are born addicted. in ohio, tragically, we had a 750-percent increase in the number of babies born with addiction in the last 12 years. i have been to the hospitals. i have been to st. rita's in lima. i have been to rainbow babies in cleveland. i have been to cincinnati children's hospital. i have seen these babies. these are tiny babies who are addicted, and they have to be taken through withdrawal. the compassionate nurses and doctors who are doing it--god bless them--i asked them: what is going to happen to these babies? they told me: rob, we don't know. we don't know the long-term consequences because it is so new. but it is dramatic and it is happening in all of your hospitals. these neonatal units are now taking on a whole other task, which is helping babies through withdrawal. i visited folks who are not only pregnant but are addicted, and i talked to them about what they are going through and what the consequences are going to be, and it is sad. many say: rob, the grip of addiction is so great. i am now in treatment, but i worry about what is going to happen to my baby. we also expand treatment for expectant and postpartum women for that reason. and these expectant and postpartum women who need this help can make the right decision with more help from us. it expands residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with addiction. it creates a pilot program to provide family-based services to women who are addicted to opiates. cara also helps veterans, as i said. it allows those veterans to get into a veterans court, where they can get help to walk through how they get out of this addiction, how they get into recovery. they can get support from other veterans around them to provide the kind of help they need to get out of this cycle of incarceration and addiction. what do we say to the 40 million americans who are struggling with addiction when they ask ``why don't you guys act?'' the senate acted 94 to 1. why can't we get this done? it is time to move. they shouldn't have to wait. we shouldn't have to wait. to those 40 million who struggle, to those who think they can't overcome this addiction, to those who believe there is no one out there to help them, the message is, you are not alone. there is hope. you can beat this. i have seen it. there are people who care and want to help. there are so many heartbreaking stories of addiction, but there are also so many stories of hope. i think about vanessa perkins from nelsonville, oh. vanessa became addicted to heroin. once she became addicted, she also became a victim of sex trafficking. those two are related. in ohio, they tell me that most sex trafficking has now to do with heroin addiction. in other words, the trafficker gets these women--usually women--addicted to heroin, and that is one way they become dependent on their trafficker. what vanessa tells me is that it took her a long time to turn her life around, but she was courageous and brave enough to seek treatment, and she is now back on track. for the last 6 years she has been helping others, taking her experience and using it to help others deal with their addiction. she is on the board of a group called freedom a la cart, which is a company in columbus, oh, that i visited last month that provides job opportunities for trafficking victims. they do a heck of a job and teach these women a trade, too--culinary arts. now so many of these women who had been trafficked, who had been heroin addicts, are back on their feet, reunited with their families, and know the dignity and self-respect that come from the work they are doing and from helping others. there is hope. treatment can work. mr. president, leaders in the house say they want to move anti-heroin legislation through regular order. again, i heard today that one of the leaders said they are planning to take action. i had conversations with speaker ryan on this issue. i had conversations with other leaders in the house on it. i take them at their word. i am hopeful we will see the house begin to act next week when that chamber returns, but i will say this: the house must act, and they must act soon. i am not going to be patient on this. this is urgent, and people's lives are at stake. the house must pass this bill so the president can sign it and so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives of the people we represent. this is our responsibility. we need to take advantage of this opportunity that the senate has given us by this huge vote--94 to 1--to get this legislation to the president and get it enacted into law. mr. president, i yield back my time. the presiding officer. the senator from michigan. flint, michigan, water crisis ms. stabenow. mr. president, today i would like to speak about two different subjects. both are connected in the sense that they involve lack of action and people counting on us to act as a senate. the first involves the fact that today in the city of flint, mi, we still have people who can't drink the water coming out of the tap. i think any one of us would have trouble if that happened for 1 day, but we are talking about months and months--going on 2 years now--that we have seen a system completely broken down because of decisions, because of lack of treating the water, a whole range of things. from my perspective, the most important thing is the fact that people still don't have access to clean, safe water. they can't bathe their babies. they can't take a shower themselves. i can't imagine what it must be like for families in flint who are waiting and waiting for help. i want to thank president obama for doing what he can do through the administration to help from the standpoint of health and nutrition and education, but the fundamental problem is replacing the damaged pipes. as my colleagues know, we have been working very hard and we have developed a bipartisan proposal. i wish to thank the chair and ranking member of the energy and natural resources committee, senator murkowski and senator cantwell, for working with us, and so many colleagues who are now bipartisan cosponsors on a bill with myself and senator peters. i wish to thank senator inhofe as chair of epw and ranking member senator boxer and so many people who have [[page s1792]] come together to support this effort, not only for flint, but we now are seeing headlines across the country about other areas where lead poisoning in water is a serious issue and where we have all kinds of communities with water infrastructure needs. we have put together a proposal. we have a bipartisan proposal. we are ready to move forward. we need a vote on this proposal. as people in this building know, the junior senator from utah is holding us up from being able to get that vote. we have spent weeks now--weeks-- trying to find a way to get beyond this objection. we thought we had an agreement, and then the bar just keeps changing. this is not a game. these are real people, and we are trying to solve a real problem. we have put forward a proposal fully paid for that actually reduces the deficit, paid for out of a program that i care deeply about because i authored it in 2007, and prior to senator peters being a senator, when he was in the house, he was the champion of the program that we are offering to use as a payfor. so i just want to remind everyone--and i am going to continue to come to the floor and remind colleagues every day--that a group of americans in a city of 100,000 where there has been a federal emergency declared are still waiting for us to act to help them--not to do the whole thing, not to pay for all of what needs to be done in terms of water infrastructure, but to do our part as a federal government, as we have done in communities across the country for other kinds of emergencies. we need to help the children of flint. nine thousand children under the age of six are being exposed to lead poisoning; some homes have exposure higher than a toxic waste dump. i can tell my colleagues as a mother and now as a grandmother, i would never tolerate something like that. i can't imagine what is happening for families. we have the opportunity to do something. it is easy. it is fully paid for. it is fully paid for by something that colleagues on the other side of the aisle have wanted to eliminate--fully paid for. it helps communities across the country. now we have a situation where one member has indicated, well, it is not his problem. he doesn't care; it is not his problem. i hope as americans we are willing to say that other people's problems--i would think we care about them, whether it is our own children, our own grandchildren, people we know or not. that is what we expect when there are emergencies and disasters across the country. and whether it is in the farm bill that i worked on with the distinguished presiding officer where we strengthened livestock disaster assistance-- even though that is not a huge issue to me in the state of michigan, but i know it is for a lot of states and a lot of communities. that is what we do as americans. we care about people and communities. we have a group of people right now who are not being seen. i want my colleagues to see this baby and the picture this represents of a group of people who are waiting for help and deserve help. filling the supreme court vacancy mr. president, i wish to address something else now and turn to history to talk about somebody else who is waiting. he can drink his water and take a shower. that is a good thing. but we have a very distinguished jurist, the chief judge of the dc court of appeals, nominated by the president of the united states to be a supreme court justice, who is waiting for the opportunity to be heard, to have a hearing, to meet with people, to have a vote, yes or no. we have spoken a lot about the constitution, about responsibilities, about debates. our three branches of government are sworn to uphold both the written word of the constitution and the spirit of the constitution. this spirit was expressed in a series of articles beginning in 1787. i wasn't there at the time. but in reading what our founding fathers said--those who framed the constitution--i think it is important to look at what they intended through the federalist papers. on april 1, 1788, alexander hamilton, writing in federalist paper no. 76, outlined two specific roles for supreme court nominees: that the president nominate justices and the senate provide advice and consent. hamilton explained how the senate held the power to reject a nominee, to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from family connection, from personal attachment, or from other biases. as my colleagues know, senators can investigate the character of a nominee by meeting the nominee in person, by holding hearings, and by looking at their writings. at the senate judiciary committee they can ask the nominee questions in full view of the public. based on responses, if they believe a nominee does not have the appropriate character, they can reject the nomination. they can vote no. that is our right as senators. but senators in the current republican majority are refusing to do any of that. they have said they will not hold hearings. most of them will not even meet with the nominee, judge merrick garland. i want to commend republican senators who are, in fact, meeting with judge garland. this is their job. this is our job--the job established for us by america's founding fathers--and a majority of the majority is refusing to do it. now, according to the average time for moving a supreme court nominee through the process, if the republican majority did their job, as previous senates did, then there would be a hearing of the judiciary committee by april 27, but there is none scheduled. the judiciary committee would hold a vote by may 12, but there is no vote coming. and based on historical precedent, the supreme court nominee would then come to the floor for a vote on confirmation before memorial day. but because my colleagues across the aisle are refusing to do their job, that vote will not happen. my republican colleagues like to say that the senate does not confirm supreme court nominees during a presidential year, but that doesn't square with the facts. more than a dozen supreme court nominees have been confirmed by the senate in an election year. in 1988, also a presidential year, the senate did its job by confirming president reagan's supreme court nominee, justice anthony kennedy, with a democratically controlled senate. in 1940, another presidential election year, the senate did its job by confirming president franklin roosevelt's nominee, justice frank murphy. in 1932, the senate did its job by confirming president hoover's supreme court nominee. in 1916, the senate did its job twice by confirming president wilson's two nominees for the supreme court. the u.s. constitution was ratified in june 1788, just a few months after hamilton published the federalist paper i mentioned a few minutes ago. and for nearly 228 years--228 years--during times of war, times of peace, periods of prosperity, and periods of economic hardship, america has balanced the powers between the executive and the legislative branches in selecting who would serve in the third branch of government. we have done it during democratic majorities and republican majorities for 228 years. to those who are refusing to hold hearings on a nomination, my question is this: what has changed? what has changed this year? what is it about this president that causes him to be treated this way? what is it that is leading my colleagues to question the judgment and the wisdom of alexander hamilton and the rest of the founding fathers who signed the constitution and gave us the responsibility for advice and consent? in short, why now are you refusing to do your job? just do your job. do what we are paid to do. last month, i went over in front of the supreme court on a beautiful, sunny day when a lot of people were here visiting, and i talked to a number of citizens and asked them what they thought about what was happening, the debate going on about filling a vacancy on the supreme court. i also asked them what would happen to you if during a year you told your employer that a major part of your job--a very big responsibility that you have in your job--you were going to refuse to do for a year or so. what would happen? well, the answer is pretty easy. people said: i would be fired. people say: why aren't you doing your job? why isn't the majority doing its job? because if you are not willing to do the work, why should you have the job? nobody else can do that in their job. [[page s1793]] that is why the polls show overwhelmingly that the american people side with those of us on the democratic side, with all of us who stand together as democratic senators to say: do your job. we are willing to do our job. people stand with the constitution and with the overwhelming history of our country. it is very simple. it is a very simple idea. it is a phrase we say all the time in all kinds of circumstances. we say to our children, we say to people we work with: just do your job. well, this is our job. hold a hearing, meet with the nominee, have a vote. you can vote yes; you can vote no. you could skip that day. but this judge deserves a vote, and it is our responsibility to vote and to fill the vacancy on the highest court in the land. that is what the american people expect us to do. that is what they deserve. it is time that the senate do its job. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cassidy. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. cassidy. mr. president, i rise today to discuss several provisions in an amendment to the faa reauthorization bill that is currently before the senate and that specifically benefits my home state of louisiana. there are more than 253 air traffic control towers throughout the country operating through a successful public-private partnership called the federal contract tower program. this program is especially critical to rural areas--as i have in louisiana and as does the presiding officer--to ensure that america's airspace and the traveling public are safe. however, there are currently 30 towers awaiting the faa to finalize an internal agency formula called the benefit-cost analysis, referred to as the bca, which will allow eligible towers to enter the federal contract tower program. one of these airports is the hammond northshore regional airport in hammond, la. the federal contract tower program has been in place for more than 30 years and is a prime example of an effective public-private partnership between government and the private sector. contract towers handle approximately 28 percent of the nation's air traffic control tower operations but account for only 14 percent of the faa's total tower operations budget. repeated studies by the u.s. department of transportation inspector general have shown that the contract tower program increases aviation safety while reducing costs to taxpayers and the federal government. it is also important to note that approximately 80 percent of the contract controller workforce are veterans. congress has demonstrated numerous times in bipartisan fashion the merit and need for the federal contract tower program. given the success of the program and the increasing likelihood of further faa delays, i am pleased the commerce committee included language in the faa reauthorization bill to strengthen and improve the federal contract tower program. senators cornyn, vitter, portman, and wicker have been leaders on this issue, and their work is greatly appreciated. currently, america's trade and economy are being hampered because many cargo planes from other countries are prohibited from flying into u.s. airports because they have not been upgraded to newer types of technology. some aircraft are what is called ``stage 2 aircraft.'' these aircraft were phased out following the passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990, which mandated the phaseout for stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds. i have introduced an amendment that would permit flights to a small number of airports under limited circumstances for revenue and nonrevenue flights of stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds. one of the airports that meets the criteria is the acadiana regional airport in new iberia, la. this airport is located in a heavy industrial complex and surrounded by agricultural land. the acadiana regional airport has an advantage over other types of airports because it is surrounded by land use compatible with airport operations. additionally, it is situated near the port of iberia, which is home to more than 100 companies employing close to 5,000 people in industries such as construction, energy, equipment rental, and trucking. this would bolster louisiana's economy, help working families, and improve america's ability to trade with the world. louisiana's economy relies on the thriving maritime industry. in 2014 a study from the transportation institute showed that 54,850 maritime- related jobs contribute more than $11 billion annually to louisiana's economy. one in every 83 louisiana jobs is connected to the domestic maritime industry, nearly twice that of any other state. with ports along the mississippi and red rivers, our state sees vessels of varying sizes and types. while loading cargo, these ships must drain ballast water that they have taken on to maintain the balance of the ship. this can have varying degrees of environmental effects, with costly and confusing state and federal regulations making compliance difficult. senator rubio is sponsoring the vessel incidental discharge act, which creates a uniform, enforceable, and scientifically based national standard on ballast water discharges. this is needed in order to simplify the highly complicated and overly burdensome patchwork of state and federal regulations that are in place today. everyone i talk to in louisiana's maritime industry and also in the inland marine, which would take the agriculture products from states such as the state the presiding officer represents, says it is necessary for these regulations to be harmonized, and they emphasize the importance of passing this bill. i am a cosponsor of this bill, and i am glad to see that senator rubio has filed the amendment to the bill we are considering on the floor today. the faa reauthorization act contains many measures that will protect americans, improve our economy, and protect our environment. i urge all my fellow senators to support the bill and these amendments. i yield the floor. amendment no. 3512, as modified mr. leahy. mr. president, aviation safety, as much as all national security, must be of paramount importance. i am increasingly concerned with reports from across the country that secure identification display area, sida, badges have gone missing, either through loss or theft. these badges, which grant access to secure areas of airports, allow employees to bypass traditional security checkpoints and, in the wrong hands, can pose a considerable security threat. an amendment considered and adopted earlier today by the senate, thune amendment no. 3512, is aimed at addressing this problem and would implement additional accountability and oversight methods to ensure that these sida badges do not fall into the wrong hands. it would provide for further employer accountability and allow for increased fines and enforcement actions against workers that fail to report the loss or theft of a badge. these are well-intentioned goals and ones that i support. i opposed this amendment, however, because extraneous provisions included in the amendment directly contradict bipartisan efforts in this congress to reform our criminal justice system, including by reducing unnecessary barriers to employment for people with criminal records. the amendment will require the tsa administrator to propose increasing the lookback period from 10 years to 15 years for background checks of airport and airline workers who have or are seeking sida badges. under current regulations, there are a number of offenses that disqualify a potential employee, if the individual was convicted of the offense during the 10-year lookback period. the amendment would also require the tsa administrator to consider adding more offenses to the list of disqualifying crimes. disqualifying offenses already include a number of low-level offenses, such as felony drug possession. these provisions would exacerbate barriers to reentry. the scope of the changes will still exclude many potential employees and lead to the firing of a number of current employees. [[page s1794]] i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks a letter from transport workers union of america, the afl-cio, the association of flight attendants, cwa--the communication workers of america, the international association of machinists and aerospace workers, the transportation trades department--afl-cio, the leadership conference on civil and human rights, and the national employment law project in opposition to this amendment. i am committed to working with senator thune to ensure greater accountability for secure identification display area badges. it must be a priority. i hope that he and others will work with me through the conference of this bill to eliminate these barriers to employment for individuals with certain criminal records. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: april 6, 2016. oppose the airport security enhancement and oversight act (s. 2361) as an amendment to the faa reauthorization act (h.r. 636) dear senator: on behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to oppose any efforts to expand background checks on aviation workers as proposed in the airport security enhancement and oversight act (s. 2361). in particular, we are opposed to the inclusion of s. 2361 as an amendment to h.r. 636, the faa reauthorization act, which is currently under consideration in the senate. as drafted, s. 2361 would undermine reforms around the nation that have reduced barriers to employment of people with criminal records, thus representing a serious setback for the bipartisan criminal justice reform movement. the airport security enhancement and oversight act would alter the requirements for airport workers to obtain secure identification display area (sida) badges by instructing the transportation security administration (tsa) administrator to propose increasing the lookback period on many aviation workers' employment background checks from 10 years to 15 years. this provision undermines the goal of promoting rehabilitation, and it conflicts with the substantial research documenting that criminal history lookback periods should not extend back more than seven years. the bill also instructs the tsa administrator to consider increasing disqualifying criminal offenses to include crimes that do not appear to be related to transportation security. these reforms would have far reaching impact and exacerbate barriers to reentry. as many as one in three americans have a criminal record and nearly half of u.s. children have a parent with a criminal record, creating life-long barriers to opportunity, including employment, for entire families. this change will also have an overwhelming discriminatory impact on communities of color, who have been hardest hit by a flawed criminal justice system. moreover, this proposal does not account for the compelling evidence documenting the impact of gainful employment on those who have previously been convicted of a crime. full integration into society is essential to successful anti-terror programs and efforts to lower recidivism rates. by requiring the dismissal of many current employees who have worked in a position for years, the legislation ignores these widely accepted principles. we do support some elements of this legislation. the bill would create a waiver process for those who are denied credentials. this would ensure the consideration of circumstances from which it may be concluded that an individual does not pose a risk of terrorism or to security. the waiver process would consider the circumstances surrounding an offense, restitution, mitigation remedies, and other factors. this provision is modeled on a very successful program in the transportation worker identification credential (twic), a credential that is similar to a sida, which is used at secure areas of port facilities. we strongly encourage you oppose the inclusion of any amendment providing blanket categorical exclusions that would increase background checks on aviation workers and act as additional barriers to the employment of people with criminal records. thank you for your consideration. if you have any questions, please feel free to contact brendan danaher, director of government affairs at the transport workers union, or greg regan, senior legislative representative at the transportation trades department, afl-cio. sincerely, transport workers union of america. afl-cio. association of flight attendants--cwa. communication workers of america. international association of machinists and aerospace workers. the leadership conference on civil and human rights. national employment law project. transportation trades department, afl-cio. vote explanation mr. durbin. mr. president, i was absent from today's votes on three amendments to the pending business, h.r. 636, the vehicle for a bill to reauthorize the federal aviation administration, due to events i attended with president obama in illinois. had i been present, my votes would have been as follows. on rollcall vote no. 41, thune amendment no. 3512, as modified, i would have voted against adoption. i am concerned about the impact that a provision in this amendment will have on formerly incarcerated individuals who have successfully reintegrated into society after completing sentences for low-level crimes unrelated to transportation security. the provision, which will make it more difficult for these individuals to obtain certain aviation jobs years after a criminal conviction, undermines efforts to reduce barriers to reentry, lower recidivism rates, and reform our criminal justice system. on rollcall vote no. 42, heinrich amendment no. 3482, as modified, i would have voted in favor of adoption. this amendment will further strengthen the homeland by increasing security in soft targets at airports, in areas like check-ins and baggage claims, where terrorists recently carried out deadly attacks in brussels. the amendment will expand and enhance visible deterrents, create a new eligible use under homeland security grants for training exercises to enhance preparedness for active shooter incidents, and authorize and make explicit that homeland security grants can be used for airport and surface transportation in these nonsecure soft target areas. i am proud to have cosponsored this amendment. on rollcall vote no. 43, schumer amendment no. 3483, i would have voted in favor of adoption. this amendment would establish consumer safeguards like minimum standards for space for passengers on aircrafts, including the size and pitch of seats, the amount of leg room, and the width of aisles. as these votes demonstrate, after a series of temporary extensions, the senate is finally considering a long-term faa reauthorization bill. in light of recent threats both here and abroad, it is important that we get this right. i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis on these important security reforms, consumer protections, and other pressing aviation-related issues in the coming days and weeks. mr. cassidy. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. cassidy). without objection, it is so ordered. unanimous consent agreement--executive calendar mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that on monday, april 11, at 5 p.m., the senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: calendar no. 215; that there be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the president be immediately notified of the senate's action, and the senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",144504

Mr. President, I wish to call the attention of my colleagues to the 227th anniversary of Congress' first quorum, which the House of Representatives achieved on April 1, 1789, and which the Senate achieved 5 days later. In the first week of April, the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress remembers these milestones by observing Congress Week--an annual celebration which includes commemorative events at member institutions across the country. The Association of Centers for the Study of Congress is composed of more than 40 universities that work to preserve the historical collections of Members of Congress. The organization's goal is to promote public understanding of the House and the Senate by focusing on the history of Congress and its role in our constitutional system of government. Having served as a member of this body for nearly four decades, I understand well the importance of keeping good records, which is why I am sincerely grateful for the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress and its efforts to help us in this endeavor. While Presidents have Presidential libraries maintained by the National Archives, we--the Members of Congress--are responsible for preserving our own personal documents. Only by archiving these records will historians, students, and teachers be able to appreciate the vital role that Congress has played in our national history. As President Pro Tempore, I am committed to upholding the reputation and dignity of this institution. Part and parcel to that effort is preserving the Senate's history. To this end, I strongly encourage my colleagues to keep comprehensive records of their work in Congress. Just as important as writing legislation is maintaining a thorough record of the bills we pass, so that future generations can appreciate the historical importance of our accomplishments. Serving as a Member of the world's greatest deliberative body is no small honor; it is a tremendous privilege that none of us should take for granted. The American people have placed their confidence in our ability to effect meaningful change for the good of the country. May we honor this sacred trust by keeping detailed archives of the work we do here. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1802] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OBSERVING CONGRESS WEEK Mr. HATCH.

CREC-2016-04-07-pt1-PgS1795-2,CREC-2016-04-07,114,AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015--Continued,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1795-S1802] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a unique opportunity for the American people to have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court. The American people should be afforded the opportunity to weigh in on this very important matter. Our side, meaning the Republican side, believes very strongly that the people deserve to be heard, and they should be allowed to decide through their vote for the next President the type of person who should be on the Supreme Court. As I have stated previously, this is a reasonable approach, it is a fair approach, and it is a historical approach--one echoed by then- Chairman Biden, Senator Schumer, and other Senators. The other side, meaning the Democratic side, has been talking a great deal about the so-called pressure campaign to try to get Members to change their position. It is no secret that the White House strategy is to put pressure on this chairman of the Judiciary Committee and other Republicans in the hopes that we can be worn down and ultimately agree to hold hearings on the nominee. This pressure campaign, which is targeted at me and a handful of my colleagues, is based on the supposition that I and they will crack and move forward on the consideration of President Obama's pick. This strategy has failed to recognize that I am no stranger to political pressure and to strong-arm tactics--not necessarily just from Democratic Presidents but also from Republican Presidents. When I make a decision based on sound principle, I am not about to flip-flop because the left has organized what they call a pressure campaign. As many of my colleagues--and especially my constituents--know, I have done battle with administrations of both parties. I have fought over irresponsible budgets, waste, fraud, and policy disagreements. I have made tough decisions. I have stuck with those tough decisions regardless of what pressure was applied. The so-called pressure being applied to me now is nothing. It is absolutely nothing compared to what I withstood from heavyhanded White House political operations in the past. Let me say, by the way, that most of that has come from Republican White Houses. To just give a few examples, in 1981, as a new Member of the Senate and a brand-new member of the Senate Budget Committee, I voted against President Reagan's first budget proposal because we were promised a balanced budget and it didn't balance. I remember very specifically the Budget Committee markup in April 1981 on President Reagan's first budget. It happened to be that I wasn't alone on this. I was one of three Republicans to vote against that resolution because it did not put us on a path to a balanced budget. You can imagine that when a budget has to come out on a party-line vote, you cannot lose three Republicans, and three Republicans who were elected in 1980 on a promise to balance the budget did not go along with it. What a loss this was for this new President Reagan--that his budget might not get adopted by the Budget Committee. We were under immense pressure to act on the President's budget regardless of the deficits that it would cause. But we stood on principle and didn't succumb to the pressure. As an example, right after that vote where the President's budget wasn't voted out of the Budget Committee, I was home on a spring recess. I remember calls from the White House. I remember threats from the Chamber of Commerce while I was home for Easter break, even interrupting my town meetings. Four years later, I led the charge to freeze spending and to end the Reagan defense buildup as a way to get the Federal budget under control. In 1984 I teamed up with Senator Biden, a Democrat, and Senator Kassebaum of Kansas, a Republican, to propose a freeze of the defense budget that would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the annual deficit. At the time, it was known as the Kassebaum-Grassley Budget or the KGB defense freeze. We were going to make sure that across-the-board budgets were responsible. For months, I endured pressure from the Reagan administration and from my Republican colleagues who argued a freeze on defense spending would constitute unilateral disarmament. President Reagan had put together a less aggressive deficit reduction plan. We didn't think it went far enough. My bipartisan plan was attacked for being dangerous and causing draconian cuts to the defense budget. I knew it was realistic and a responsible approach. I didn't back down. We forced a vote that year in the Budget Committee. We forced a vote on the Senate floor on May 2, 1984, and that particular year we were not successful. However, this effort required the Senate and the Nation to have a debate about a growing defense budget. We started that debate, about the waste and inefficiency in the Pentagon and the growing Federal fiscal deficits. Despite the weeks-long pressure from conservatives in the Reagan administration, I did not back down because I knew the policy was on my side. In this process I stood up to pressure from President Reagan, Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger, Secretary Barry Goldwater, Senator John Tower, Chairman of the Budget Committee, and many others. I remember a meeting at the White House where I reminded the President that he had been talking through the campaign about the Welfare queens impacting the budget. It happens that I reminded him there were Defense queens as well. I started doing oversight on the Defense Department. It wasn't long before the evidence of waste and fraud began appearing. We uncovered contractors that billed the Defense Department $435 for a claw hammer, $750 for toilet seats, $695 for ashtrays. We even found a coffee pot that cost $7,600. I had no problem finding Democrats to join my oversight effort back then, but it is interesting how difficult it is to find bipartisan help when doing oversight in the current Democrat administration. Nevertheless, 12 months later, on May 2, 1985, after a year of [[Page S1796]] work to make the case that the Defense Department needed structural reforms and slower spending growth, I was successful. My amendment to freeze the defense budget and allow for increases based on inflation was agreed to when a motion to table failed by a vote of 48 to 51. A majority of the Republicans opposed me, and a majority of the Democrats were with me. That didn't matter because I knew we were doing the right thing. I went against my own party, my own President, to hold the Pentagon accountable, and I never backed off. I had a similar experience with President George W. Bush in 1991. In January 1991, the Senate debated a resolution to authorize the use of U.S. Armed Forces to remove Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. I opposed the resolution because I felt the economic and diplomatic sanctions that I voted for should have been given more time to work. I was not ready to give up on sanctions in favor of war. In the end, I was one of just two Republicans, along with Senator Hatfield of Oregon, to oppose the resolution. I was under pressure from President Bush, Vice President Quayle, and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu. I was even pressured by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. I heard from a lot of Iowans, particularly Republicans, who were disappointed and even angry with my position. Some were even considering a public rebuke because of my vote. As one of just two Republicans, it was difficult to differ with a Republican President on such a major issue. But as I stated at the time, my decision was above any partisanship. It was a decision of conscience rather than a matter of Republican versus Democrat. After a tremendous amount of soul-searching, I did what I thought was right, regardless of the political pressure. The same is true today with regard to the Supreme Court vacancy. Under President George W. Bush, I faced another dilemma. The President and the Republican congressional leadership determined that they wanted to provide $1.6 trillion in tax relief in 2001. I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance. The problem is, we had a Senate that was divided 50-50 at the time. The parties' numbers also equal, on the Senate Finance Committee. I had two members on my side who were reluctant to support a huge tax cut because they had concerns about the deficit and the debt. As we saw a few years later, their concerns were not totally unwarranted. But, at the time, the administration leadership would have nothing to do with anything except what the President wanted--$1.6 trillion in tax relief. Obviously, the White House wasn't thinking about how many Republicans might vote against it, and when you have a 50-50 Senate, you can't lose a lot of Republicans. After very difficult negotiations, I finally rounded up enough votes to support $1.3 trillion in tax relief. A hailstorm of criticism followed. There were Republican House Members who held press conferences denouncing the fact that the Committee wasn't able get enough votes for the whole $1.6 trillion. Those House Members were more professional in their criticism of my position, than what we currently witness almost every day from the current minority leader about my role as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But, it was still a very contentious and difficult period that included both the budget and the reconciliation process. Minority Leader Reid has already recently brought up the pressure I came under in regard to ObamaCare back in 2009. Of course, his version is his usual attempt to rewrite the actual history. At that time, I was the ranking member of the Finance Committee. I was involved in very in- depth negotiations to try to come up with a health care solution. We started in November of 2008. We had negotiations between three Republicans and three Democrats on the Finance Committee. We met for hours and hours at a time. We met between November 2008 and mid-September 2009, and then the other side decided they ought to go political and not worry about Republicans. The minority leader, in his usual inaccurate statement of facts has tried to say that Republicans walked out of those negotiations on ObamaCare. The fact is, we were given a deadline and told that if we didn't agree with the latest draft of the bill, then Democrats would have to move on. I would suggest that anybody in the Senate who wants some reference on this should talk to Senator Snowe or Senator Enzi. I was the other Republican. Talk to Senator Baucus, talk to Senator Conrad and the then-Senator from New Mexico. The President called six of us to the White House in early August of 2009. The first question I got was this: Would you, Senator Grassley, be willing to go along with two or three Republicans to have a bipartisan bill with ObamaCare at that point? And I said: Mr. President, the answer is no. What do you think we have been working on for 9 months? We have been working, trying to get a broad bipartisan agreement. It's something like 70 to 75 votes you need to get if you really want to have a changed social policy and have it stick. We didn't abandon this until 2009. But my idea is that probably it was that meeting at the White House in early August 2009 where this President decided: we don't want to mess around with those Republicans anymore. We have 60 votes; we are going to move ahead. Well, that happened then in that September. The fact is, we were given that deadline, and we were shoved out of the room. So when we didn't bow to this pressure and agree to Democratic demands, it ended up being a partisan document. That is why it still doesn't have the majority support of the American people. I want the minority leader to know that is what happened, not what he described a couple of weeks ago. Eventually, as we all know, the former majority leader--now minority leader--had his staff rewrite the bill that came out of the HELP Committee and in secret in the back rooms of his leadership office. And we ended up with the disaster called ObamaCare that we have today. The Senate minority leader also recently proclaimed that rather than follow Leader McConnell--and these are Senator Reid's words-- ``Republicans are sprinting in the opposite direction.'' The minority leader also wishfully claimed that the Republican facade was cracking on the issue. Senator Schumer fancifully stated that ``because of the pressure, Republicans are beginning to change.'' You can almost hear the ruby slippers on the other side clicking while they wish this narrative they describe were true. The fact is, the pressure they have applied thus far has had no impact on this Senator's principled position or the principled position of almost everybody on this side of the aisle. Our side knows and believes that what we are doing is right, and when that is the case, it is not hard to withstand the outrage and the pressure they and the White House have manufactured. The pressure we are now getting on this issue pales in comparison to the pressure I have endured and withstood from both Democrats and Republicans in the past. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the bill that is on the floor, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. I thank Senator Thune and Senator Nelson for their leadership. I serve on the Commerce Committee. I am proud of this bill. Our State has a long history of aviation. It was the childhood home of Charles Lindbergh. We are home to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, the 13th busiest airport in the United States. We are home to Cirrus Design Corporation in Duluth, which makes planes and is a very successful company, as well as many people whose jobs and ways of life depend on the aviation industry, not to mention the 148th Fighter Wing National Guard base, as well as the one in the Twin Cities and the one in Duluth. I see my colleague from Arizona is here, so I will focus on one issue, and that is aviation security. Mr. President, 9/11 was our country's wake-up call that our transportation system is a target, and the attacks in Brussels last month remind us that we must continue to do everything we can to strengthen security, and not just in our security lines at the airports but also in places like baggage claim areas and other forms of transportation, like train stations. We need to make sure [[Page S1797]] our soft-target areas, as they are called--like the security lines, baggage claims, and ticketing counters at the airport--are safe. I am a cosponsor of the amendment that passed today that will help address the issue by doubling the number of visible intermodal prevention and response teams from 30 to 60. These teams help provide important deterrent security at potential air and ground transportation targets across our country. This amendment which passed today will also improve existing security systems in airports and train stations by expanding bomb-sniffing dog patrols, law enforcement training for emergency situations, and security in all perimeter areas of the airport. We must also improve the secure areas of airports where airline employees have secure access to what are called sterile areas. In March, as we all know, an airline employee was arrested after attempting to use his badge to enter the boarding area of a terminal from the tarmac, bypassing security gates. He had a backpack with $282,000 in it. In the same month, we saw another employee try to smuggle 70 pounds of cocaine in her suitcase at LAX, and she was caught at a security checkpoint. The most egregious breach of security happened at the Atlanta airport, where airline employees helped to facilitate a gun-smuggling ring and were successful at getting guns on at least 20 flights from Atlanta to New York. Needless to say, there continues to be significant concern, as much as we know that the vast majority of our airline employees are hard-working and good employees. Eighty-five Senators just voted in support of the Airport Security Enforcement and Oversight Act, a bill I cosponsored that would help address this issue of security at the airport, but I would like to add our own story out of Minnesota-St. Paul. First of all, it is a story of inefficiency, so we made a reconfiguration at our airport. There were lines at one point where the average time was 45 to 50 minutes--average time. That was just a month ago. There were passengers waiting for 2 hours and missing their flights. There were simply not enough TSA agents. They were out at a training, which was, of course, necessary because of the inspector general's report that came out this June and showed some severe problems in security at our airports. So we had a perfect storm of people out for training, a new reconfiguration, and finally the spring break travel. But it was simply unacceptable when our taxpayers are paying for TSA. In fact, this Congress authorized $100 million--$90 million more than they asked for in the last budget year. I have appreciated TSA Administrator Neffenger coming to Minnesota, saying that it was unacceptable, saying that they were hiring people with the budget money that was provided. There are also plans to use these K-9 units not just in the perimeters of the bill we passed today but also on these lines. Not only do these dog teams add more security, by working a line of passengers, they actually speed up that line because then those passengers essentially become precheck passengers and they don't have to be prechecked. They become prechecked because of the dogs, and that speeds up everything for all airport passengers. I think we have seen enough of these terrorist attacks across the country, planes with bombs going down in other places. We know this is a danger. We don't want this in our homeland. I appreciate the support of my colleagues on these amendments. We will continue to work on security issues. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Permanent VA Choice Card Act Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the urgent need for Congress to reform how the Department of Veterans Affairs delivers health care to our Nation's veterans. One of the great scandals and shameful aspects of the greatest Nation in the world is the way we treat our veterans. I believe important progress has been made since the scandal in which veterans died, waiting on nonexisting wait-lists for care at the Phoenix VA medical center and VA hospitals around the country, but we have a long way to go to fulfill our solemn promise to every veteran who has served and sacrificed. In the matter of that terrible scandal, I was proud that Congress quickly acted to pass the bipartisan Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act. That bill was an important first step--and I emphasize ``first step''--in reforming the gross mismanagement and lack of accountability at the VA. In my view, the hallmark of the bill is the Choice Card Program, which for the first time allows any veteran who is waiting more than 30 days for an appointment or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA health care facility to receive a Choice Card that they can use to visit a participating doctor in their community instead of being forced to wait with no recourse. So how is the VA Choice Card working? My colleagues in the Senate and I continue to hear from veterans in Arizona and across the country about their ongoing problems receiving care. Veterans find that VA staff don't know about the Choice Card or how to authorize care through it. Veterans are forced to wait on hold for hours with a call center in order to schedule an appointment. Community doctors and hospitals that volunteered to participate in the Choice Program are not getting paid for their services. Veterans who are able to use the Choice Card once and need to use it again have to start all over from scratch. Veterans still have to drive long distances to get prescription medications. There should be no doubt that the VA is failing to fully and effectively implement the Choice Card. In doing so, it is preventing our veterans from receiving the flexible care they have earned and deserve. We know that when implemented correctly, the Choice Card Program is improving care for our veterans. After an extremely difficult start, the VA Choice Card is now authorizing more than 110,000 appointments for veteran care per month--over 5,000 per workday. Each of these appointments represents a veteran's appointment that would otherwise be delayed and pending for months in the VA scheduling system. It also frees up appointments at the VA for veterans who do not use the Choice Card, helping countless veterans receive an appointment faster. We have also seen what can happen when the VA properly reimburses community doctors for their services. In the western region alone, community doctors participating in the VA Choice Program have increased from around 95,000 to nearly 160,000. More than 90 percent of all doctors are being paid within 30 days, and the vast majority of doctors are choosing to stay in the VA Choice Program--mainly because of their love of country--to treat our Nation's veterans. Moreover, we have seen that when the VA is equipped to handle the demand for Choice Program appointments made through call centers, veterans are getting their appointments faster. Recent openings of new call centers have greatly reduced wait and on-hold times among our veterans. Today, wait time averages for veterans calling into the western region call centers for Choice Card appointments are less than 1 minute. As a result of a positive VA policy change last year, contractors are now able to contact veterans and ensure that their authorizations for care are approved ahead of time so that appointments can be made much faster over the phone. While we are seeing important progress as a result of the Choice Card, far too many veterans are still experiencing long wait and on- hold times with call centers and confronting difficulties getting an appointment. Unfortunately, some veterans, veterans service organizations, and opponents of the VA Choice Card cite these shortcomings as evidence that the whole Choice Card Program is broken and needs to be eliminated. These opponents are wrong, and they know it. The problem isn't the Choice Card; it is that the VA refuses to implement it correctly. Instead of working to solve the problems at the VA head-on, the same bureaucrats who have completely bungled the implementation of the VA Choice Card are using their own failures as an excuse to shut down the entire program. Allowing them to do so would only send veterans back to the unacceptable status quo of never-ending [[Page S1798]] wait times for appointments. Does anybody want to return to the status quo? I refuse to send our veterans back to the nonexistent wait-lists that led to the scandal of denied and delayed care in the first place. Every representative in Congress and every official at the VA should too. According to a poll recently released by Gallup, the American people overwhelmingly agree. Ninety-one percent of survey respondents believe that veterans should be allowed to get health care from any provider who accepts Medicare, not just the VA. This chart describes the main problems with VA health care before the Choice Program. Today, military and civilian retirees; Federal employees, including VA employees; ObamaCare enrollees; civilians on employer insurance plans; and refugees and illegal immigrants have the ability to choose their doctors. The only group of Americans who is still being denied universal choice in health care is disabled veterans. How is it that we have created a system where virtually everyone in America gets to choose their doctor except for our Nation's disabled veterans? Our veterans want and need the opportunity to choose the health care that works best for them. It is simply unacceptable that half a million veterans nationwide today are waiting for a medical appointment that is scheduled more than 30 days from now. We can address this crisis now by making simple changes to the law. Under the law, the VA Choice Card pilot program expires next year. We cannot and will not go back to the way our VA operated before the scandal. While some senior VA leaders are aggressively implementing the Choice Program, many others believe veterans should be forced to stay within the walls of the VA no matter what. Making the program permanent will send a clear message that we refuse to send veterans back to the days of denied and delayed care. That is why I introduced legislation to make the VA Choice Card permanent and universal. I believe every veteran--no matter where they live or how long they are waiting for an appointment--should have the ability to see a doctor of their choice in their community. Last week I held a townhall meeting with veterans in Phoenix, AZ, along with Mike Broomhead, a distinguished leader in our community. With tears in their eyes and frustration in their voices, veterans described the unending wait times for appointments and difficulty obtaining and using the Choice Card to receive the care they want and need. More than 2 years after the scandal in care first arose in Phoenix, AZ, and more than a year after reform legislation was signed into law, the VA is still failing our veterans. It doesn't have to be this way. There are additional steps we can take now to reform this broken health care system. That is why I recently announced my Care Veterans Deserve action plan. The elements of my plan address some of the most urgent problems still plaguing the VA. First, the action plan proposes keeping the VA open later during the week and opening the VA on weekends for local doctors and nurses to treat our veterans. This would address the most common complaint we hear that wait times for appointments are still too long. In Arizona, wait times have gotten worse--not better--over the last year, with more than 10 percent of all the Arizona veterans having to wait more than 30 days for care at the VA. Despite these long wait times, veterans are still not allowed to make appointments past 3 p.m. during the week and have very few appointment options on weekends. VA employees abruptly close clinics no matter what a veteran needs at the end of the day. By keeping the VA open later and adding hours on weekends, we can address these unacceptably high wait times and maximize the use of our VA facilities. I have also proposed in the Care Veterans Deserve action plan that the VA allow community walk-in clinics to treat veterans for minor injuries and illnesses such as a cold, the flu, allergies, sinus infections, immunizations, vaccines, sore throats, and minor headaches. Again, this would greatly reduce the need for veterans to visit VA emergency rooms after hours and would free up appointments for everyone waiting for care at the VA. The plan also proposes that we require VA pharmacies to stay open until 8 p.m. during the week and for at least 8 hours on Saturday and Sundays. This would tackle a common complaint among our working veterans who cannot visit VA pharmacies during their limited workday hours to obtain a prescription. It is absurd that a civilian can go to a pharmacy 24 hours a day in most cities in America, but VA pharmacies close early on weekdays and completely on the weekends. I also propose in this action plan that individual VA hospitals undergo peer review from the best in health care: Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic--there is a long line of them--and other top-tier health care networks. I was disappointed that the independent review required by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act only resulted in a high-level review of the VA health care system. Its findings were so broad and general that they provided Congress with very little guidance on what is happening at individual VA hospitals in our States. By requiring the VA to undergo peer reviews from the best in health care, we will have better insight into how to fully reform the VA health care system. I intend to include the elements of that action plan in a bill I will introduce in this Congress. By enacting legislation as soon as possible, we can fix the serious inequity in veterans health care. It is absurd to me and many others that virtually every American receives Federal subsidies for choice and freedom in health care while veterans are forced to wait in line and ask permission from a VA bureaucrat before getting access to care. I thank my colleagues for working with me on these and other measures that will help finish the work we started nearly 2 years ago with the Veteran Access, Choice and Accountability Act and urge passage of my commonsense reforms as soon as possible. Before I close, I want to take a moment to applaud the efforts of my friend from Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Johnny Isakson, for his leadership, particularly on the issue of accountability at the VA. One of the most disgraceful aspects of the scandal at the VA is that only a small number of senior VA executives responsible for the wait-time scandal were fired. This was despite the fact that Congress provided the VA Secretary broad authority to hold corrupt executives accountable for wrongdoing. I look forward to working with Chairman Isakson and my colleagues in the Senate to pass legislation that would ensure we hold all those responsible for denied and delayed care, even the deaths of some, accountable. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. EUREKA Act Mr. WICKER. Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, I once again come to the floor to talk about Alzheimer's and the efforts being made in this country and in this Senate and in this city to find a cure and find better treatments for the scourge of Alzheimer's. Many of you know this is the most expensive disease our country has ever seen; one-half trillion dollars a year in costs to programs that we need to protect like Medicare, Medicaid. This will rise to $1 trillion per year in the lifetime of many people within the sound of my voice unless something is done. I am so appreciative of the some 1,200 people who descended on Washington this week advocating on behalf of the millions of Americans living with Alzheimer's and their family members. I was honored to be invited to their conference and to speak to over 1,000 people in the hotel where they were meeting earlier this week. They then came to Capitol Hill to visit in the offices of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, and I had a great meeting on Wednesday in my office. We want to reaffirm our dedication to putting an end to this terrible disease. My mom died with dementia. Most of us have family members who have had Alzheimer's or who have been impacted by Alzheimer's. [[Page S1799]] I appreciate the support of my colleagues in this Congress for NIH funding. It is very important to continue funding, to continue increasing the funding for the excellent work done by the National Institutes of Health to fight Alzheimer's disease and fund Alzheimer's research. I appreciate my colleagues voting for a $350 million increase in research for Alzheimer's disease, but of course this falls far short. This is funding that experts say is needed to reach our goal of curing Alzheimer's within the next decade. Along those lines, I have introduced legislation that I think gives us a different way to approach the disease of Alzheimer's. My bill is called the EUREKA Act that involves a prize competition, in addition to everything we are doing in research, everything NIH is doing, and all the research being done around the country. It is a prize competition inviting innovators, inviting people to think outside the box, come forward, and give us their ideas. EUREKA stands for ``Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for Alzheimer's.'' Of course, the Greek translation for Eureka is ``I found it.'' That is what we are trying to do--trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's, trying to find milestones that will lead to a cure, and trying to find treatments to help those suffering from the disease. The goal of my EUREKA Act is to find the best and brightest minds in the country, the best and brightest minds in the world, to come forward and use their ingenuity to solve this complex problem. As I have reiterated in visits with Member after Member, and I have reiterated on the floor, with a prize competition, we pay only for success. Regardless of the amount of money we put on the prize, you don't pay the money until we have success, which is one of the reasons this EUREKA provision wouldn't come out of NIH funding. It would add to it, and we would only pay the money if we got the result, which of course would be far more valuable than the prize. The numbers associated with Alzheimer's are daunting--even worse, chilling. The disease affects 5 million Americans. The number of people with Alzheimer's is on the rise, as we all know. It is the sixth leading cause of death in America and, again, it is the most expensive disease in America: $236 billion this year and $1 trillion per year by the year 2050. Of course, there is a huge burden for the caregivers also. There is good news, to be sure. It was announced last week that there's been an analysis by UsAgainstAlzheimer's, and it showed some 17 drugs for Alzheimer's could be launched in the next 5 years. In Mississippi, the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson has developed a service called TeleMIND as part of its MIND Center. Telehealth technology is being used to attack Alzheimer's, to treat Alzheimer's patients, and make life better for them and their family. Let us try the concept of EUREKA also. Let us try the concept of offering a prize to young minds. Perhaps people from around the world might come to the United States. This might be someone in a basement or in his mom's garage or might be some major international corporation. We don't care. We want to offer an incentive for somebody to come around, think outside the box, and get us to a cure quicker. Prizes have a history of success. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh achieved a nonstop flight between New York and Paris. He won a prize of $25,000 in so doing. In 2004, the XPRIZE--sponsored by the XPRIZE Foundation-- offered $10 million for the first reusable manned spacecraft. You know what happened. It drew down $100 million in investments, this $10 million prize. In 2011, $1 million was awarded for a breakthrough in oilspill cleanup. So prizes work. It can work, in addition to the research NIH is doing around the country. Let me say, in addition to myself as principal sponsor of this act, we now have 39 cosponsors among this 100-person Senate. We are day-by- day, step-by-step getting toward a majority. It is my hope the leadership of the HELP Committee that is now working on the 21st Century Cures Act that came over from the House with an overwhelming bipartisan vote--I hope we can, in a bipartisan fashion, with the leadership of Senator Alexander, with the leadership of Senator Murray--his lead Democrat on the committee--I hope we can make a decision to add the EUREKA bill to the 21st Century Cures Act, to have this extra opportunity, in addition to everything we are doing, to cure Alzheimer's. I would urge my colleagues, I would urge the staff members who might be listening to this, to check and see if their Members have cosponsored this and to help us with an additional tool to attack the problem of Alzheimer's. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Michigan for deferring for a moment or two while I make these remarks. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, it is very hard for me to believe I am once again standing on this floor. I have to come before my colleagues in the Senate to report that despite the fact that we have been building bipartisan support for legislation that will address the catastrophic situation in Flint, we still have one Senator standing in the way of this coming to a vote. It has been now nearly 2 months since Senator Stabenow and I introduced legislation to deal with the catastrophic crisis in the city of Flint, MI. Since that time, we have been able to build a broad coalition of folks on both sides of the aisle, Republican cosponsors who have joined with us to say it is time for this body, it is time for the Senate, to stand and help those in need in the city of Flint, as well as issues all across this country. Senator Stabenow and I offered legislation, along with Senator Inhofe, and a long list of Democrats and Republicans, including Senators Burr, Capito, Kirk, and Portman, have been working very closely with Senator Murkowski as chair of the committee as well. Yet we have one Senator, one Senator who says that is not enough. He wants to have more, and he is standing in the way of the people of Flint getting the help they desperately need. He is standing in the way of children like this young infant who appeared on the cover of Time magazine. To me, those eyes are very compelling, and I think those eyes are very compelling to every American who has witnessed what has happened in that city, who has witnessed the horror and the tragedy of having poisoned water going into people's bodies for many months while the State government dropped the ball. I will say folks around the country have responded. There has been an outpouring of help from people in every corner of this great country of ours. People have sent bottled water. They have sent filters and are providing resources. It is what our country does. It is what our people do when we see people in crisis. We stand and lend that helping hand. We know any one of us at any time could be in that situation. The wonderful thing about being an American is that as Americans we look out for each other. We know we are a community, a very special place in this world, and we look out for each other. That is why people back home in Michigan--and as I travel around the country--people are at a loss and wondering why the U.S. Congress hasn't done something to address this issue. When I tell them we have legislation that will help deal with infrastructure, not just in Flint but in communities all across the country, that will plus-up public health programs to deal with lead poisoning at a time when we realize lead poisoning is not just an issue for Flint but is an issue for communities all across this country and one we need to focus on and probably ignored for far too long, they wonder why we have not acted. When I tell them we have one Senator--just one Senator--standing in the way, it only adds to their belief that this is a dysfunctional place; that partisanship and polarization have prevented this body from doing what is right. We can't forget the people of Flint, and I know many of my colleagues on the Senate floor have not. That is why we have been able to get broad support from both Democrats and Republicans, who have come together and said to both my senior Senator, Ms. Stabenow, and me: We understand it is a problem in Flint, but we also understand it is a problem in other communities around the country. Let us design legislation to deal with that. That is what we have before us. We have legislation that will provide money for those cities that may be in [[Page S1800]] a declared emergency, which is where we are with the city of Flint, but we also know there may be other communities in this country--in fact, we think there will be a community very soon--that will also have a declared water emergency that will be able to access those funds. We also know aging infrastructure is not unique to the city of Flint. It is with cities all across the country, especially older urban areas that have lead surface lines, but there are certainly many rural areas that have that as well. Those pipes need to be taken out. In this legislation, we create a fund that will allow money to be loaned to those communities--oftentimes, communities that don't have a lot of resources but desperately need infrastructure improvement. It is a loan fund that will be paid back to the taxpayers but will extend the money necessary to make improvements that truly will be lifesaving improvements for the citizens in those cities. We also plus-up a number of public health programs from the CDC that deal with lead poisoning in children. The insidious thing about lead poisoning is that once it gets into the brain of a young child--like this child who is looking at us right now in this picture I have in the Chamber--it has lasting effects. It has lifetime effects. We need not only to embrace that child with our love but understand that the child is going to need health care for decades. That child is going to need educational support to be able to pursue his or her version of the American dream that he or she may have. They are going to need to have, in addition to education and health care, good nutrition, making sure the food they eat will provide their bodies with the nourishment that can counter some of the impacts of lead. But it is not just the children; it is everybody in the city of Flint. Senior citizens have also been impacted. I have gone door to door in Flint and worked with volunteers, including the American Red Cross, delivering bottled water to the people of Flint. I never thought I would have to go with the American Red Cross to deliver bottled water to a community because the water they were getting out of their pipes was poisoned--not in this country, not in the United States of America. But that is what people are doing, and filters as well are being given door to door. The people of Flint are appreciative. Please know they are extremely appreciative of the generosity they have seen from people across this country and from FEMA response as well, but they are also frustrated. People can't bathe with bottled water. They are cooking and cleaning food--all of the basic things we take for granted each and every day. It is simply impossible to live just on bottled water and have that bottled water delivered to them every few days. It is not a workable system. It is unacceptable, and it certainly should be unacceptable to everybody in this country. That is why we need to have a long-term solution. It has to be a long-term solution that will fix the problem permanently by making sure the infrastructure improvements are there, lead pipes are pulled out, but makes sure other support services are going to be there for decades. My fear for the people of the city of Flint is that although they have been the beneficiaries of a great outpouring of love and support from people around the country, they have been able to get that because the spotlight has been on Flint and the TV cameras are in Flint. We all know in today's media world that those cameras will eventually go away. There won't be media attention for Flint. There won't be the bright lights of publicity motivating people to do what is needed in the city of Flint. When those lights go down and when it goes dark, the people of the city of Flint will still be confronted with this absolutely catastrophic situation that is impacting them in their homes. It is impacting businesses--businesses that have been rocked as a result of this. People don't want to go to restaurants because they are not sure of the water there. Real estate values have plummeted. This is a different kind of a disaster than a natural disaster if a hurricane goes through or a tornado goes through. Then we can rebuild, and it can be as good as new. Our concern with Flint is that there will always be this stigma attached to the city as a result of this, and if that stigma is there, it is going to make it even more difficult. The people of Flint are resilient and courageous and brave and strong. They will survive, but we need to be there to lend that helping hand. That is why it is even more frustrating to me, given the fact that when we have natural disasters across this country, this body--the Senate--acts. We send money. We help those local governments. The State governments provide help. Now, I know some colleagues have said that this is not a natural disaster, that this is a manmade disaster. All I can say is to ask that child when he or she grows up: Does it make a difference that it was a manmade disaster or a natural disaster? Ask the senior citizen in Flint right now. Ask the parent who is concerned about that child. Does it make any difference? I don't think any American here thinks it makes a difference. There isn't anybody in this country who thinks it makes a difference. A disaster is a disaster. Now, it is true the State government messed up horribly in Michigan. In fact, the Governor's own task force that he appointed to look into it clearly points the finger at the State of Michigan and the incompetence that was shown by the government of the State of Michigan. That is a given. They are primarily responsible and need to step up, and they have. But they need to do a whole lot more than what they have done so far. But even though the State has to do that and must do that, that doesn't prevent us, the Federal Government, from also standing up and saying: We can help as well because that is what we do. It is what the American people expect us to do. I certainly hope my colleagues will help Senator Stabenow and I move this legislation forward. If we can't get around this one Senator who wants to constantly move the goalpost, who wants to change the basis of negotiations even though this legislation is completely paid for--we have used a pay-for that Senator Stabenow fought for, authored to help manufacturers in the Midwest. I fought aggressively to keep that fund when I was a Member of the House. This is something that is important to us, but we know that dealing with a catastrophic situation in Flint and water infrastructure across this country so that we don't have any more Flints is more important. That money will be used to help the people of Flint and communities across this country. Not only does it pay for this, but it actually reduces the deficit at the same time. I think it is important to say that usually when a disaster hits this country, we don't look for pay-fors. We step up and provide money for people in need. We have been asked to come up with a pay-for, and we did--completely paid for while reducing the Federal deficit at the same time. Yet we have one Senator who wants more. He wants more. I don't know how that one Senator can hold up something that has been able to get this kind of bipartisan support and can hold up something that is so important to this child in this picture. How can you stand in the way? If that one Senator does not like this legislation, that is fine. They can vote against it. But allow the other 99 Senators in this body an opportunity to have their say. That is the way this institution is supposed to work. I still believe in this institution. I still believe the Senate can do better than allowing one Member to stand in the way of helping this child and other children just like this one. It is now our task as Members of this body to come together and say: Enough is enough. We are going to help somebody in this country no matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter the circumstances. If you have been hit by a major disaster, we will stand with you. We will help you. That is who we are as Americans. It goes to the very core of our values. It is now up to my colleagues here in the Senate to please join Senator Stabenow and me and our long list of both Democratic and Republican cosponsors. Put this legislation on the floor. Let's vote on it, let's pass it, and let's help the people of Flint and other folks all across the country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. [[Page S1801]] Tribute to Trent Harmon and La'Porsha Renae Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I don't know what other Members of the Senate will be doing at 8 p.m. eastern time, but I can tell you I will be in front of my television set watching ``American Idol.'' We all take pride in people from our own States, but I want to boldly predict that the winner of ``American Idol'' tonight will be a contestant from my State of Mississippi. The reason I am so certain of this is that two talented Mississippians are the two finalists remaining in the ``American Idol'' competition tonight. They say this will be the final season of ``American Idol.'' Perhaps we are only going to have a timeout for a few years, and we will see it back. This is the 15th season of ``American Idol.'' I am so proud to announce to my colleagues in the Senate and to the Presiding Officer that the two finalists are none other than Trent Harmon of Amory, MS, and La'Porsha Renae of McComb, MS. Now, in Mississippi we proudly call ourselves the Birthplace of America's Music, and I think we do that with some justification. From blues to country to rock and roll, our State has produced more Grammy award winners per capita than any other State in the Nation. Elvis Presley comes from Mississippi, as well as Robert Johnson, B.B. King, Jimmie Rodgers, Charley Pride, Faith Hill, and the list goes on and on and on. Last month, I was honored to participate in the opening of the Grammy Museum in Cleveland, MS. There are now two Grammy museums in the country. One is in Los Angeles and the other is in the Mississippi Delta in Cleveland. The Mississippi Delta is a testament to the many musical inspirations that have emerged there. In 1986, Paul Simon sang: ``The Mississippi Delta is shining like a National guitar.'' He sang that line 20 years before the first Mississippi Blues Trail marker was placed, but he was correct. We now have some 200 Blues Trail markers across our State, and I invite each and every Member and all the rest of you to come and visit those locations in Mississippi. But tonight, the entire State of Mississippi will be shining like a national guitar with talents like La'Porsha Renae and Trent Harmon. They are keeping our legacy alive. They represent the wide range of Mississippi's musical influences. It was wonderfully touching to watch the video of their hometown visits, where the people came out to support them, showing off their Mississippi talent and the dedication of their fans. Trent Harmon is from Amory, MS. He grew up on his family's farm, working in his parents' restaurant, the Longhorn Fish and Steakhouse. Growing up in Amory is truly a small town beginning. The town has a population of around 7,500 people. Trent's interest in music was apparent from early on, as he spent his time in high school and college performing in musicals. My wife and I have numerous times been to Amory High School to see Trent Harmon perform in programs such as ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' ``Forever Plaid,'' and other performances. He was a star then, and he is going to be a star in the future. Trent's powerful voice and versatility seem effortless. He can do it all, from southern soul to R & B. La'Porsha Renae comes from McComb, MS, down in the southwestern part of our State. She worked for a call center before auditioning for ``American Idol.'' She has shared with America the details about her story of survival from an abusive relationship in which she had to seek refuge in a women's shelter. Her soulful voice has been compared to Aretha Franklin, and the emotion she pours into every performance is truly show-stopping. She credits her former high school algebra teacher, Angelia Johnson, as one of her biggest mentors who encouraged her to embrace her own signature style. La'Porsha dedicated last night's moving performance of ``Diamonds'' to her young daughter who was in the audience. So when it comes to talent, I believe ``American Idol'' may have saved the best for last, and I very much anticipate a great performance tonight. Millions of Americans will choose one of these outstanding young Mississippians as the latest, but perhaps not the last, ``American Idol.'' Trent and La'Porsha have made Mississippi proud. They have made me proud, and I wish them all the best tonight and in their future musical careers. I am quite certain that both of them will be incredibly successful.

The Senator from Iowa. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a unique opportunity for the American people to have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court. The American people should be afforded the opportunity to weigh in on this very important matter. Our side, meaning the Republican side, believes very strongly that the people deserve to be heard, and they should be allowed to decide through their vote for the next President the type of person who should be on the Supreme Court. As I have stated previously, this is a reasonable approach, it is a fair approach, and it is a historical approach--one echoed by then- Chairman Biden, Senator Schumer, and other Senators. The other side, meaning the Democratic side, has been talking a great deal about the so-called pressure campaign to try to get Members to change their position. It is no secret that the White House strategy is to put pressure on this chairman of the Judiciary Committee and other Republicans in the hopes that we can be worn down and ultimately agree to hold hearings on the nominee. This pressure campaign, which is targeted at me and a handful of my colleagues, is based on the supposition that I and they will crack and move forward on the consideration of President Obama's pick. This strategy has failed to recognize that I am no stranger to political pressure and to strong-arm tactics--not necessarily just from Democratic Presidents but also from Republican Presidents. When I make a decision based on sound principle, I am not about to flip-flop because the left has organized what they call a pressure campaign. As many of my colleagues--and especially my constituents--know, I have done battle with administrations of both parties. I have fought over irresponsible budgets, waste, fraud, and policy disagreements. I have made tough decisions. I have stuck with those tough decisions regardless of what pressure was applied. The so-called pressure being applied to me now is nothing. It is absolutely nothing compared to what I withstood from heavyhanded White House political operations in the past. Let me say, by the way, that most of that has come from Republican White Houses. To just give a few examples, in 1981, as a new Member of the Senate and a brand-new member of the Senate Budget Committee, I voted against President Reagan's first budget proposal because we were promised a balanced budget and it didn't balance. I remember very specifically the Budget Committee markup in April 1981 on President Reagan's first budget. It happened to be that I wasn't alone on this. I was one of three Republicans to vote against that resolution because it did not put us on a path to a balanced budget. You can imagine that when a budget has to come out on a party-line vote, you cannot lose three Republicans, and three Republicans who were elected in 1980 on a promise to balance the budget did not go along with it. What a loss this was for this new President Reagan--that his budget might not get adopted by the Budget Committee. We were under immense pressure to act on the President's budget regardless of the deficits that it would cause. But we stood on principle and didn't succumb to the pressure. As an example, right after that vote where the President's budget wasn't voted out of the Budget Committee, I was home on a spring recess. I remember calls from the White House. I remember threats from the Chamber of Commerce while I was home for Easter break, even interrupting my town meetings. Four years later, I led the charge to freeze spending and to end the Reagan defense buildup as a way to get the Federal budget under control. In 1984 I teamed up with Senator Biden, a Democrat, and Senator Kassebaum of Kansas, a Republican, to propose a freeze of the defense budget that would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the annual deficit. At the time, it was known as the Kassebaum-Grassley Budget or the KGB defense freeze. We were going to make sure that across-the-board budgets were responsible. For months, I endured pressure from the Reagan administration and from my Republican colleagues who argued a freeze on defense spending would constitute unilateral disarmament. President Reagan had put together a less aggressive deficit reduction plan. We didn't think it went far enough. My bipartisan plan was attacked for being dangerous and causing draconian cuts to the defense budget. I knew it was realistic and a responsible approach. I didn't back down. We forced a vote that year in the Budget Committee. We forced a vote on the Senate floor on May 2, 1984, and that particular year we were not successful. However, this effort required the Senate and the Nation to have a debate about a growing defense budget. We started that debate, about the waste and inefficiency in the Pentagon and the growing Federal fiscal deficits. Despite the weeks-long pressure from conservatives in the Reagan administration, I did not back down because I knew the policy was on my side. In this process I stood up to pressure from President Reagan, Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger, Secretary Barry Goldwater, Senator John Tower, Chairman of the Budget Committee, and many others. I remember a meeting at the White House where I reminded the President that he had been talking through the campaign about the Welfare queens impacting the budget. It happens that I reminded him there were Defense queens as well. I started doing oversight on the Defense Department. It wasn't long before the evidence of waste and fraud began appearing. We uncovered contractors that billed the Defense Department $435 for a claw hammer, $750 for toilet seats, $695 for ashtrays. We even found a coffee pot that cost $7,600. I had no problem finding Democrats to join my oversight effort back then, but it is interesting how difficult it is to find bipartisan help when doing oversight in the current Democrat administration. Nevertheless, 12 months later, on May 2, 1985, after a year of [[Page S1796]] work to make the case that the Defense Department needed structural reforms and slower spending growth, I was successful. My amendment to freeze the defense budget and allow for increases based on inflation was agreed to when a motion to table failed by a vote of 48 to 51. A majority of the Republicans opposed me, and a majority of the Democrats were with me. That didn't matter because I knew we were doing the right thing. I went against my own party, my own President, to hold the Pentagon accountable, and I never backed off. I had a similar experience with President George W. Bush in 1991. In January 1991, the Senate debated a resolution to authorize the use of U.S. Armed Forces to remove Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. I opposed the resolution because I felt the economic and diplomatic sanctions that I voted for should have been given more time to work. I was not ready to give up on sanctions in favor of war. In the end, I was one of just two Republicans, along with Senator Hatfield of Oregon, to oppose the resolution. I was under pressure from President Bush, Vice President Quayle, and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu. I was even pressured by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. I heard from a lot of Iowans, particularly Republicans, who were disappointed and even angry with my position. Some were even considering a public rebuke because of my vote. As one of just two Republicans, it was difficult to differ with a Republican President on such a major issue. But as I stated at the time, my decision was above any partisanship. It was a decision of conscience rather than a matter of Republican versus Democrat. After a tremendous amount of soul-searching, I did what I thought was right, regardless of the political pressure. The same is true today with regard to the Supreme Court vacancy. Under President George W. Bush, I faced another dilemma. The President and the Republican congressional leadership determined that they wanted to provide $1.6 trillion in tax relief in 2001. I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance. The problem is, we had a Senate that was divided 50-50 at the time. The parties' numbers also equal, on the Senate Finance Committee. I had two members on my side who were reluctant to support a huge tax cut because they had concerns about the deficit and the debt. As we saw a few years later, their concerns were not totally unwarranted. But, at the time, the administration leadership would have nothing to do with anything except what the President wanted--$1.6 trillion in tax relief. Obviously, the White House wasn't thinking about how many Republicans might vote against it, and when you have a 50-50 Senate, you can't lose a lot of Republicans. After very difficult negotiations, I finally rounded up enough votes to support $1.3 trillion in tax relief. A hailstorm of criticism followed. There were Republican House Members who held press conferences denouncing the fact that the Committee wasn't able get enough votes for the whole $1.6 trillion. Those House Members were more professional in their criticism of my position, than what we currently witness almost every day from the current minority leader about my role as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But, it was still a very contentious and difficult period that included both the budget and the reconciliation process. Minority Leader Reid has already recently brought up the pressure I came under in regard to ObamaCare back in 2009. Of course, his version is his usual attempt to rewrite the actual history. At that time, I was the ranking member of the Finance Committee. I was involved in very in- depth negotiations to try to come up with a health care solution. We started in November of 2008. We had negotiations between three Republicans and three Democrats on the Finance Committee. We met for hours and hours at a time. We met between November 2008 and mid-September 2009, and then the other side decided they ought to go political and not worry about Republicans. The minority leader, in his usual inaccurate statement of facts has tried to say that Republicans walked out of those negotiations on ObamaCare. The fact is, we were given a deadline and told that if we didn't agree with the latest draft of the bill, then Democrats would have to move on. I would suggest that anybody in the Senate who wants some reference on this should talk to Senator Snowe or Senator Enzi. I was the other Republican. Talk to Senator Baucus, talk to Senator Conrad and the then-Senator from New Mexico. The President called six of us to the White House in early August of 2009. The first question I got was this: Would you, Senator Grassley, be willing to go along with two or three Republicans to have a bipartisan bill with ObamaCare at that point? And I said: Mr. President, the answer is no. What do you think we have been working on for 9 months? We have been working, trying to get a broad bipartisan agreement. It's something like 70 to 75 votes you need to get if you really want to have a changed social policy and have it stick. We didn't abandon this until 2009. But my idea is that probably it was that meeting at the White House in early August 2009 where this President decided: we don't want to mess around with those Republicans anymore. We have 60 votes; we are going to move ahead. Well, that happened then in that September. The fact is, we were given that deadline, and we were shoved out of the room. So when we didn't bow to this pressure and agree to Democratic demands, it ended up being a partisan document. That is why it still doesn't have the majority support of the American people. I want the minority leader to know that is what happened, not what he described a couple of weeks ago. Eventually, as we all know, the former majority leader--now minority leader--had his staff rewrite the bill that came out of the HELP Committee and in secret in the back rooms of his leadership office. And we ended up with the disaster called ObamaCare that we have today. The Senate minority leader also recently proclaimed that rather than follow Leader McConnell--and these are Senator Reid's words-- ``Republicans are sprinting in the opposite direction.'' The minority leader also wishfully claimed that the Republican facade was cracking on the issue. Senator Schumer fancifully stated that ``because of the pressure, Republicans are beginning to change.'' You can almost hear the ruby slippers on the other side clicking while they wish this narrative they describe were true. The fact is, the pressure they have applied thus far has had no impact on this Senator's principled position or the principled position of almost everybody on this side of the aisle. Our side knows and believes that what we are doing is right, and when that is the case, it is not hard to withstand the outrage and the pressure they and the White House have manufactured. The pressure we are now getting on this issue pales in comparison to the pressure I have endured and withstood from both Democrats and Republicans in the past. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the bill that is on the floor, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. I thank Senator Thune and Senator Nelson for their leadership. I serve on the Commerce Committee. I am proud of this bill. Our State has a long history of aviation. It was the childhood home of Charles Lindbergh. We are home to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, the 13th busiest airport in the United States. We are home to Cirrus Design Corporation in Duluth, which makes planes and is a very successful company, as well as many people whose jobs and ways of life depend on the aviation industry, not to mention the 148th Fighter Wing National Guard base, as well as the one in the Twin Cities and the one in Duluth. I see my colleague from Arizona is here, so I will focus on one issue, and that is aviation security. Mr. President, 9/11 was our country's wake-up call that our transportation system is a target, and the attacks in Brussels last month remind us that we must continue to do everything we can to strengthen security, and not just in our security lines at the airports but also in places like baggage claim areas and other forms of transportation, like train stations. We need to make sure [[Page S1797]] our soft-target areas, as they are called--like the security lines, baggage claims, and ticketing counters at the airport--are safe. I am a cosponsor of the amendment that passed today that will help address the issue by doubling the number of visible intermodal prevention and response teams from 30 to 60. These teams help provide important deterrent security at potential air and ground transportation targets across our country. This amendment which passed today will also improve existing security systems in airports and train stations by expanding bomb-sniffing dog patrols, law enforcement training for emergency situations, and security in all perimeter areas of the airport. We must also improve the secure areas of airports where airline employees have secure access to what are called sterile areas. In March, as we all know, an airline employee was arrested after attempting to use his badge to enter the boarding area of a terminal from the tarmac, bypassing security gates. He had a backpack with $282,000 in it. In the same month, we saw another employee try to smuggle 70 pounds of cocaine in her suitcase at LAX, and she was caught at a security checkpoint. The most egregious breach of security happened at the Atlanta airport, where airline employees helped to facilitate a gun-smuggling ring and were successful at getting guns on at least 20 flights from Atlanta to New York. Needless to say, there continues to be significant concern, as much as we know that the vast majority of our airline employees are hard-working and good employees. Eighty-five Senators just voted in support of the Airport Security Enforcement and Oversight Act, a bill I cosponsored that would help address this issue of security at the airport, but I would like to add our own story out of Minnesota-St. Paul. First of all, it is a story of inefficiency, so we made a reconfiguration at our airport. There were lines at one point where the average time was 45 to 50 minutes--average time. That was just a month ago. There were passengers waiting for 2 hours and missing their flights. There were simply not enough TSA agents. They were out at a training, which was, of course, necessary because of the inspector general's report that came out this June and showed some severe problems in security at our airports. So we had a perfect storm of people out for training, a new reconfiguration, and finally the spring break travel. But it was simply unacceptable when our taxpayers are paying for TSA. In fact, this Congress authorized $100 million--$90 million more than they asked for in the last budget year. I have appreciated TSA Administrator Neffenger coming to Minnesota, saying that it was unacceptable, saying that they were hiring people with the budget money that was provided. There are also plans to use these K-9 units not just in the perimeters of the bill we passed today but also on these lines. Not only do these dog teams add more security, by working a line of passengers, they actually speed up that line because then those passengers essentially become precheck passengers and they don't have to be prechecked. They become prechecked because of the dogs, and that speeds up everything for all airport passengers. I think we have seen enough of these terrorist attacks across the country, planes with bombs going down in other places. We know this is a danger. We don't want this in our homeland. I appreciate the support of my colleagues on these amendments. We will continue to work on security issues. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Permanent VA Choice Card Act Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the urgent need for Congress to reform how the Department of Veterans Affairs delivers health care to our Nation's veterans. One of the great scandals and shameful aspects of the greatest Nation in the world is the way we treat our veterans. I believe important progress has been made since the scandal in which veterans died, waiting on nonexisting wait-lists for care at the Phoenix VA medical center and VA hospitals around the country, but we have a long way to go to fulfill our solemn promise to every veteran who has served and sacrificed. In the matter of that terrible scandal, I was proud that Congress quickly acted to pass the bipartisan Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act. That bill was an important first step--and I emphasize ``first step''--in reforming the gross mismanagement and lack of accountability at the VA. In my view, the hallmark of the bill is the Choice Card Program, which for the first time allows any veteran who is waiting more than 30 days for an appointment or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA health care facility to receive a Choice Card that they can use to visit a participating doctor in their community instead of being forced to wait with no recourse. So how is the VA Choice Card working? My colleagues in the Senate and I continue to hear from veterans in Arizona and across the country about their ongoing problems receiving care. Veterans find that VA staff don't know about the Choice Card or how to authorize care through it. Veterans are forced to wait on hold for hours with a call center in order to schedule an appointment. Community doctors and hospitals that volunteered to participate in the Choice Program are not getting paid for their services. Veterans who are able to use the Choice Card once and need to use it again have to start all over from scratch. Veterans still have to drive long distances to get prescription medications. There should be no doubt that the VA is failing to fully and effectively implement the Choice Card. In doing so, it is preventing our veterans from receiving the flexible care they have earned and deserve. We know that when implemented correctly, the Choice Card Program is improving care for our veterans. After an extremely difficult start, the VA Choice Card is now authorizing more than 110,000 appointments for veteran care per month--over 5,000 per workday. Each of these appointments represents a veteran's appointment that would otherwise be delayed and pending for months in the VA scheduling system. It also frees up appointments at the VA for veterans who do not use the Choice Card, helping countless veterans receive an appointment faster. We have also seen what can happen when the VA properly reimburses community doctors for their services. In the western region alone, community doctors participating in the VA Choice Program have increased from around 95,000 to nearly 160,000. More than 90 percent of all doctors are being paid within 30 days, and the vast majority of doctors are choosing to stay in the VA Choice Program--mainly because of their love of country--to treat our Nation's veterans. Moreover, we have seen that when the VA is equipped to handle the demand for Choice Program appointments made through call centers, veterans are getting their appointments faster. Recent openings of new call centers have greatly reduced wait and on-hold times among our veterans. Today, wait time averages for veterans calling into the western region call centers for Choice Card appointments are less than 1 minute. As a result of a positive VA policy change last year, contractors are now able to contact veterans and ensure that their authorizations for care are approved ahead of time so that appointments can be made much faster over the phone. While we are seeing important progress as a result of the Choice Card, far too many veterans are still experiencing long wait and on- hold times with call centers and confronting difficulties getting an appointment. Unfortunately, some veterans, veterans service organizations, and opponents of the VA Choice Card cite these shortcomings as evidence that the whole Choice Card Program is broken and needs to be eliminated. These opponents are wrong, and they know it. The problem isn't the Choice Card; it is that the VA refuses to implement it correctly. Instead of working to solve the problems at the VA head-on, the same bureaucrats who have completely bungled the implementation of the VA Choice Card are using their own failures as an excuse to shut down the entire program. Allowing them to do so would only send veterans back to the unacceptable status quo of never-ending [[Page S1798]] wait times for appointments. Does anybody want to return to the status quo? I refuse to send our veterans back to the nonexistent wait-lists that led to the scandal of denied and delayed care in the first place. Every representative in Congress and every official at the VA should too. According to a poll recently released by Gallup, the American people overwhelmingly agree. Ninety-one percent of survey respondents believe that veterans should be allowed to get health care from any provider who accepts Medicare, not just the VA. This chart describes the main problems with VA health care before the Choice Program. Today, military and civilian retirees; Federal employees, including VA employees; ObamaCare enrollees; civilians on employer insurance plans; and refugees and illegal immigrants have the ability to choose their doctors. The only group of Americans who is still being denied universal choice in health care is disabled veterans. How is it that we have created a system where virtually everyone in America gets to choose their doctor except for our Nation's disabled veterans? Our veterans want and need the opportunity to choose the health care that works best for them. It is simply unacceptable that half a million veterans nationwide today are waiting for a medical appointment that is scheduled more than 30 days from now. We can address this crisis now by making simple changes to the law. Under the law, the VA Choice Card pilot program expires next year. We cannot and will not go back to the way our VA operated before the scandal. While some senior VA leaders are aggressively implementing the Choice Program, many others believe veterans should be forced to stay within the walls of the VA no matter what. Making the program permanent will send a clear message that we refuse to send veterans back to the days of denied and delayed care. That is why I introduced legislation to make the VA Choice Card permanent and universal. I believe every veteran--no matter where they live or how long they are waiting for an appointment--should have the ability to see a doctor of their choice in their community. Last week I held a townhall meeting with veterans in Phoenix, AZ, along with Mike Broomhead, a distinguished leader in our community. With tears in their eyes and frustration in their voices, veterans described the unending wait times for appointments and difficulty obtaining and using the Choice Card to receive the care they want and need. More than 2 years after the scandal in care first arose in Phoenix, AZ, and more than a year after reform legislation was signed into law, the VA is still failing our veterans. It doesn't have to be this way. There are additional steps we can take now to reform this broken health care system. That is why I recently announced my Care Veterans Deserve action plan. The elements of my plan address some of the most urgent problems still plaguing the VA. First, the action plan proposes keeping the VA open later during the week and opening the VA on weekends for local doctors and nurses to treat our veterans. This would address the most common complaint we hear that wait times for appointments are still too long. In Arizona, wait times have gotten worse--not better--over the last year, with more than 10 percent of all the Arizona veterans having to wait more than 30 days for care at the VA. Despite these long wait times, veterans are still not allowed to make appointments past 3 p.m. during the week and have very few appointment options on weekends. VA employees abruptly close clinics no matter what a veteran needs at the end of the day. By keeping the VA open later and adding hours on weekends, we can address these unacceptably high wait times and maximize the use of our VA facilities. I have also proposed in the Care Veterans Deserve action plan that the VA allow community walk-in clinics to treat veterans for minor injuries and illnesses such as a cold, the flu, allergies, sinus infections, immunizations, vaccines, sore throats, and minor headaches. Again, this would greatly reduce the need for veterans to visit VA emergency rooms after hours and would free up appointments for everyone waiting for care at the VA. The plan also proposes that we require VA pharmacies to stay open until 8 p.m. during the week and for at least 8 hours on Saturday and Sundays. This would tackle a common complaint among our working veterans who cannot visit VA pharmacies during their limited workday hours to obtain a prescription. It is absurd that a civilian can go to a pharmacy 24 hours a day in most cities in America, but VA pharmacies close early on weekdays and completely on the weekends. I also propose in this action plan that individual VA hospitals undergo peer review from the best in health care: Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic--there is a long line of them--and other top-tier health care networks. I was disappointed that the independent review required by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act only resulted in a high-level review of the VA health care system. Its findings were so broad and general that they provided Congress with very little guidance on what is happening at individual VA hospitals in our States. By requiring the VA to undergo peer reviews from the best in health care, we will have better insight into how to fully reform the VA health care system. I intend to include the elements of that action plan in a bill I will introduce in this Congress. By enacting legislation as soon as possible, we can fix the serious inequity in veterans health care. It is absurd to me and many others that virtually every American receives Federal subsidies for choice and freedom in health care while veterans are forced to wait in line and ask permission from a VA bureaucrat before getting access to care. I thank my colleagues for working with me on these and other measures that will help finish the work we started nearly 2 years ago with the Veteran Access, Choice and Accountability Act and urge passage of my commonsense reforms as soon as possible. Before I close, I want to take a moment to applaud the efforts of my friend from Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Johnny Isakson, for his leadership, particularly on the issue of accountability at the VA. One of the most disgraceful aspects of the scandal at the VA is that only a small number of senior VA executives responsible for the wait-time scandal were fired. This was despite the fact that Congress provided the VA Secretary broad authority to hold corrupt executives accountable for wrongdoing. I look forward to working with Chairman Isakson and my colleagues in the Senate to pass legislation that would ensure we hold all those responsible for denied and delayed care, even the deaths of some, accountable. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. EUREKA Act Mr. WICKER. Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, I once again come to the floor to talk about Alzheimer's and the efforts being made in this country and in this Senate and in this city to find a cure and find better treatments for the scourge of Alzheimer's. Many of you know this is the most expensive disease our country has ever seen; one-half trillion dollars a year in costs to programs that we need to protect like Medicare, Medicaid. This will rise to $1 trillion per year in the lifetime of many people within the sound of my voice unless something is done. I am so appreciative of the some 1,200 people who descended on Washington this week advocating on behalf of the millions of Americans living with Alzheimer's and their family members. I was honored to be invited to their conference and to speak to over 1,000 people in the hotel where they were meeting earlier this week. They then came to Capitol Hill to visit in the offices of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, and I had a great meeting on Wednesday in my office. We want to reaffirm our dedication to putting an end to this terrible disease. My mom died with dementia. Most of us have family members who have had Alzheimer's or who have been impacted by Alzheimer's. [[Page S1799]] I appreciate the support of my colleagues in this Congress for NIH funding. It is very important to continue funding, to continue increasing the funding for the excellent work done by the National Institutes of Health to fight Alzheimer's disease and fund Alzheimer's research. I appreciate my colleagues voting for a $350 million increase in research for Alzheimer's disease, but of course this falls far short. This is funding that experts say is needed to reach our goal of curing Alzheimer's within the next decade. Along those lines, I have introduced legislation that I think gives us a different way to approach the disease of Alzheimer's. My bill is called the EUREKA Act that involves a prize competition, in addition to everything we are doing in research, everything NIH is doing, and all the research being done around the country. It is a prize competition inviting innovators, inviting people to think outside the box, come forward, and give us their ideas. EUREKA stands for ``Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for Alzheimer's.'' Of course, the Greek translation for Eureka is ``I found it.'' That is what we are trying to do--trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's, trying to find milestones that will lead to a cure, and trying to find treatments to help those suffering from the disease. The goal of my EUREKA Act is to find the best and brightest minds in the country, the best and brightest minds in the world, to come forward and use their ingenuity to solve this complex problem. As I have reiterated in visits with Member after Member, and I have reiterated on the floor, with a prize competition, we pay only for success. Regardless of the amount of money we put on the prize, you don't pay the money until we have success, which is one of the reasons this EUREKA provision wouldn't come out of NIH funding. It would add to it, and we would only pay the money if we got the result, which of course would be far more valuable than the prize. The numbers associated with Alzheimer's are daunting--even worse, chilling. The disease affects 5 million Americans. The number of people with Alzheimer's is on the rise, as we all know. It is the sixth leading cause of death in America and, again, it is the most expensive disease in America: $236 billion this year and $1 trillion per year by the year 2050. Of course, there is a huge burden for the caregivers also. There is good news, to be sure. It was announced last week that there's been an analysis by UsAgainstAlzheimer's, and it showed some 17 drugs for Alzheimer's could be launched in the next 5 years. In Mississippi, the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson has developed a service called TeleMIND as part of its MIND Center. Telehealth technology is being used to attack Alzheimer's, to treat Alzheimer's patients, and make life better for them and their family. Let us try the concept of EUREKA also. Let us try the concept of offering a prize to young minds. Perhaps people from around the world might come to the United States. This might be someone in a basement or in his mom's garage or might be some major international corporation. We don't care. We want to offer an incentive for somebody to come around, think outside the box, and get us to a cure quicker. Prizes have a history of success. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh achieved a nonstop flight between New York and Paris. He won a prize of $25,000 in so doing. In 2004, the XPRIZE--sponsored by the XPRIZE Foundation-- offered $10 million for the first reusable manned spacecraft. You know what happened. It drew down $100 million in investments, this $10 million prize. In 2011, $1 million was awarded for a breakthrough in oilspill cleanup. So prizes work. It can work, in addition to the research NIH is doing around the country. Let me say, in addition to myself as principal sponsor of this act, we now have 39 cosponsors among this 100-person Senate. We are day-by- day, step-by-step getting toward a majority. It is my hope the leadership of the HELP Committee that is now working on the 21st Century Cures Act that came over from the House with an overwhelming bipartisan vote--I hope we can, in a bipartisan fashion, with the leadership of Senator Alexander, with the leadership of Senator Murray--his lead Democrat on the committee--I hope we can make a decision to add the EUREKA bill to the 21st Century Cures Act, to have this extra opportunity, in addition to everything we are doing, to cure Alzheimer's. I would urge my colleagues, I would urge the staff members who might be listening to this, to check and see if their Members have cosponsored this and to help us with an additional tool to attack the problem of Alzheimer's. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Michigan for deferring for a moment or two while I make these remarks. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, it is very hard for me to believe I am once again standing on this floor. I have to come before my colleagues in the Senate to report that despite the fact that we have been building bipartisan support for legislation that will address the catastrophic situation in Flint, we still have one Senator standing in the way of this coming to a vote. It has been now nearly 2 months since Senator Stabenow and I introduced legislation to deal with the catastrophic crisis in the city of Flint, MI. Since that time, we have been able to build a broad coalition of folks on both sides of the aisle, Republican cosponsors who have joined with us to say it is time for this body, it is time for the Senate, to stand and help those in need in the city of Flint, as well as issues all across this country. Senator Stabenow and I offered legislation, along with Senator Inhofe, and a long list of Democrats and Republicans, including Senators Burr, Capito, Kirk, and Portman, have been working very closely with Senator Murkowski as chair of the committee as well. Yet we have one Senator, one Senator who says that is not enough. He wants to have more, and he is standing in the way of the people of Flint getting the help they desperately need. He is standing in the way of children like this young infant who appeared on the cover of Time magazine. To me, those eyes are very compelling, and I think those eyes are very compelling to every American who has witnessed what has happened in that city, who has witnessed the horror and the tragedy of having poisoned water going into people's bodies for many months while the State government dropped the ball. I will say folks around the country have responded. There has been an outpouring of help from people in every corner of this great country of ours. People have sent bottled water. They have sent filters and are providing resources. It is what our country does. It is what our people do when we see people in crisis. We stand and lend that helping hand. We know any one of us at any time could be in that situation. The wonderful thing about being an American is that as Americans we look out for each other. We know we are a community, a very special place in this world, and we look out for each other. That is why people back home in Michigan--and as I travel around the country--people are at a loss and wondering why the U.S. Congress hasn't done something to address this issue. When I tell them we have legislation that will help deal with infrastructure, not just in Flint but in communities all across the country, that will plus-up public health programs to deal with lead poisoning at a time when we realize lead poisoning is not just an issue for Flint but is an issue for communities all across this country and one we need to focus on and probably ignored for far too long, they wonder why we have not acted. When I tell them we have one Senator--just one Senator--standing in the way, it only adds to their belief that this is a dysfunctional place; that partisanship and polarization have prevented this body from doing what is right. We can't forget the people of Flint, and I know many of my colleagues on the Senate floor have not. That is why we have been able to get broad support from both Democrats and Republicans, who have come together and said to both my senior Senator, Ms. Stabenow, and me: We understand it is a problem in Flint, but we also understand it is a problem in other communities around the country. Let us design legislation to deal with that. That is what we have before us. We have legislation that will provide money for those cities that may be in [[Page S1800]] a declared emergency, which is where we are with the city of Flint, but we also know there may be other communities in this country--in fact, we think there will be a community very soon--that will also have a declared water emergency that will be able to access those funds. We also know aging infrastructure is not unique to the city of Flint. It is with cities all across the country, especially older urban areas that have lead surface lines, but there are certainly many rural areas that have that as well. Those pipes need to be taken out. In this legislation, we create a fund that will allow money to be loaned to those communities--oftentimes, communities that don't have a lot of resources but desperately need infrastructure improvement. It is a loan fund that will be paid back to the taxpayers but will extend the money necessary to make improvements that truly will be lifesaving improvements for the citizens in those cities. We also plus-up a number of public health programs from the CDC that deal with lead poisoning in children. The insidious thing about lead poisoning is that once it gets into the brain of a young child--like this child who is looking at us right now in this picture I have in the Chamber--it has lasting effects. It has lifetime effects. We need not only to embrace that child with our love but understand that the child is going to need health care for decades. That child is going to need educational support to be able to pursue his or her version of the American dream that he or she may have. They are going to need to have, in addition to education and health care, good nutrition, making sure the food they eat will provide their bodies with the nourishment that can counter some of the impacts of lead. But it is not just the children; it is everybody in the city of Flint. Senior citizens have also been impacted. I have gone door to door in Flint and worked with volunteers, including the American Red Cross, delivering bottled water to the people of Flint. I never thought I would have to go with the American Red Cross to deliver bottled water to a community because the water they were getting out of their pipes was poisoned--not in this country, not in the United States of America. But that is what people are doing, and filters as well are being given door to door. The people of Flint are appreciative. Please know they are extremely appreciative of the generosity they have seen from people across this country and from FEMA response as well, but they are also frustrated. People can't bathe with bottled water. They are cooking and cleaning food--all of the basic things we take for granted each and every day. It is simply impossible to live just on bottled water and have that bottled water delivered to them every few days. It is not a workable system. It is unacceptable, and it certainly should be unacceptable to everybody in this country. That is why we need to have a long-term solution. It has to be a long-term solution that will fix the problem permanently by making sure the infrastructure improvements are there, lead pipes are pulled out, but makes sure other support services are going to be there for decades. My fear for the people of the city of Flint is that although they have been the beneficiaries of a great outpouring of love and support from people around the country, they have been able to get that because the spotlight has been on Flint and the TV cameras are in Flint. We all know in today's media world that those cameras will eventually go away. There won't be media attention for Flint. There won't be the bright lights of publicity motivating people to do what is needed in the city of Flint. When those lights go down and when it goes dark, the people of the city of Flint will still be confronted with this absolutely catastrophic situation that is impacting them in their homes. It is impacting businesses--businesses that have been rocked as a result of this. People don't want to go to restaurants because they are not sure of the water there. Real estate values have plummeted. This is a different kind of a disaster than a natural disaster if a hurricane goes through or a tornado goes through. Then we can rebuild, and it can be as good as new. Our concern with Flint is that there will always be this stigma attached to the city as a result of this, and if that stigma is there, it is going to make it even more difficult. The people of Flint are resilient and courageous and brave and strong. They will survive, but we need to be there to lend that helping hand. That is why it is even more frustrating to me, given the fact that when we have natural disasters across this country, this body--the Senate--acts. We send money. We help those local governments. The State governments provide help. Now, I know some colleagues have said that this is not a natural disaster, that this is a manmade disaster. All I can say is to ask that child when he or she grows up: Does it make a difference that it was a manmade disaster or a natural disaster? Ask the senior citizen in Flint right now. Ask the parent who is concerned about that child. Does it make any difference? I don't think any American here thinks it makes a difference. There isn't anybody in this country who thinks it makes a difference. A disaster is a disaster. Now, it is true the State government messed up horribly in Michigan. In fact, the Governor's own task force that he appointed to look into it clearly points the finger at the State of Michigan and the incompetence that was shown by the government of the State of Michigan. That is a given. They are primarily responsible and need to step up, and they have. But they need to do a whole lot more than what they have done so far. But even though the State has to do that and must do that, that doesn't prevent us, the Federal Government, from also standing up and saying: We can help as well because that is what we do. It is what the American people expect us to do. I certainly hope my colleagues will help Senator Stabenow and I move this legislation forward. If we can't get around this one Senator who wants to constantly move the goalpost, who wants to change the basis of negotiations even though this legislation is completely paid for--we have used a pay-for that Senator Stabenow fought for, authored to help manufacturers in the Midwest. I fought aggressively to keep that fund when I was a Member of the House. This is something that is important to us, but we know that dealing with a catastrophic situation in Flint and water infrastructure across this country so that we don't have any more Flints is more important. That money will be used to help the people of Flint and communities across this country. Not only does it pay for this, but it actually reduces the deficit at the same time. I think it is important to say that usually when a disaster hits this country, we don't look for pay-fors. We step up and provide money for people in need. We have been asked to come up with a pay-for, and we did--completely paid for while reducing the Federal deficit at the same time. Yet we have one Senator who wants more. He wants more. I don't know how that one Senator can hold up something that has been able to get this kind of bipartisan support and can hold up something that is so important to this child in this picture. How can you stand in the way? If that one Senator does not like this legislation, that is fine. They can vote against it. But allow the other 99 Senators in this body an opportunity to have their say. That is the way this institution is supposed to work. I still believe in this institution. I still believe the Senate can do better than allowing one Member to stand in the way of helping this child and other children just like this one. It is now our task as Members of this body to come together and say: Enough is enough. We are going to help somebody in this country no matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter the circumstances. If you have been hit by a major disaster, we will stand with you. We will help you. That is who we are as Americans. It goes to the very core of our values. It is now up to my colleagues here in the Senate to please join Senator Stabenow and me and our long list of both Democratic and Republican cosponsors. Put this legislation on the floor. Let's vote on it, let's pass it, and let's help the people of Flint and other folks all across the country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. [[Page S1801]] Tribute to Trent Harmon and La'Porsha Renae Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I don't know what other Members of the Senate will be doing at 8 p.m. eastern time, but I can tell you I will be in front of my television set watching ``American Idol.'' We all take pride in people from our own States, but I want to boldly predict that the winner of ``American Idol'' tonight will be a contestant from my State of Mississippi. The reason I am so certain of this is that two talented Mississippians are the two finalists remaining in the ``American Idol'' competition tonight. They say this will be the final season of ``American Idol.'' Perhaps we are only going to have a timeout for a few years, and we will see it back. This is the 15th season of ``American Idol.'' I am so proud to announce to my colleagues in the Senate and to the Presiding Officer that the two finalists are none other than Trent Harmon of Amory, MS, and La'Porsha Renae of McComb, MS. Now, in Mississippi we proudly call ourselves the Birthplace of America's Music, and I think we do that with some justification. From blues to country to rock and roll, our State has produced more Grammy award winners per capita than any other State in the Nation. Elvis Presley comes from Mississippi, as well as Robert Johnson, B.B. King, Jimmie Rodgers, Charley Pride, Faith Hill, and the list goes on and on and on. Last month, I was honored to participate in the opening of the Grammy Museum in Cleveland, MS. There are now two Grammy museums in the country. One is in Los Angeles and the other is in the Mississippi Delta in Cleveland. The Mississippi Delta is a testament to the many musical inspirations that have emerged there. In 1986, Paul Simon sang: ``The Mississippi Delta is shining like a National guitar.'' He sang that line 20 years before the first Mississippi Blues Trail marker was placed, but he was correct. We now have some 200 Blues Trail markers across our State, and I invite each and every Member and all the rest of you to come and visit those locations in Mississippi. But tonight, the entire State of Mississippi will be shining like a national guitar with talents like La'Porsha Renae and Trent Harmon. They are keeping our legacy alive. They represent the wide range of Mississippi's musical influences. It was wonderfully touching to watch the video of their hometown visits, where the people came out to support them, showing off their Mississippi talent and the dedication of their fans. Trent Harmon is from Amory, MS. He grew up on his family's farm, working in his parents' restaurant, the Longhorn Fish and Steakhouse. Growing up in Amory is truly a small town beginning. The town has a population of around 7,500 people. Trent's interest in music was apparent from early on, as he spent his time in high school and college performing in musicals. My wife and I have numerous times been to Amory High School to see Trent Harmon perform in programs such as ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' ``Forever Plaid,'' and other performances. He was a star then, and he is going to be a star in the future. Trent's powerful voice and versatility seem effortless. He can do it all, from southern soul to R & B. La'Porsha Renae comes from McComb, MS, down in the southwestern part of our State. She worked for a call center before auditioning for ``American Idol.'' She has shared with America the details about her story of survival from an abusive relationship in which she had to seek refuge in a women's shelter. Her soulful voice has been compared to Aretha Franklin, and the emotion she pours into every performance is truly show-stopping. She credits her former high school algebra teacher, Angelia Johnson, as one of her biggest mentors who encouraged her to embrace her own signature style. La'Porsha dedicated last night's moving performance of ``Diamonds'' to her young daughter who was in the audience. So when it comes to talent, I believe ``American Idol'' may have saved the best for last, and I very much anticipate a great performance tonight. Millions of Americans will choose one of these outstanding young Mississippians as the latest, but perhaps not the last, ``American Idol.'' Trent and La'Porsha have made Mississippi proud. They have made me proud, and I wish them all the best tonight and in their future musical careers. I am quite certain that both of them will be incredibly successful.

The Senator from Iowa. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a unique opportunity for the American people to have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court. The American people should be afforded the opportunity to weigh in on this very important matter. Our side, meaning the Republican side, believes very strongly that the people deserve to be heard, and they should be allowed to decide through their vote for the next President the type of person who should be on the Supreme Court. As I have stated previously, this is a reasonable approach, it is a fair approach, and it is a historical approach--one echoed by then- Chairman Biden, Senator Schumer, and other Senators. The other side, meaning the Democratic side, has been talking a great deal about the so-called pressure campaign to try to get Members to change their position. It is no secret that the White House strategy is to put pressure on this chairman of the Judiciary Committee and other Republicans in the hopes that we can be worn down and ultimately agree to hold hearings on the nominee. This pressure campaign, which is targeted at me and a handful of my colleagues, is based on the supposition that I and they will crack and move forward on the consideration of President Obama's pick. This strategy has failed to recognize that I am no stranger to political pressure and to strong-arm tactics--not necessarily just from Democratic Presidents but also from Republican Presidents. When I make a decision based on sound principle, I am not about to flip-flop because the left has organized what they call a pressure campaign. As many of my colleagues--and especially my constituents--know, I have done battle with administrations of both parties. I have fought over irresponsible budgets, waste, fraud, and policy disagreements. I have made tough decisions. I have stuck with those tough decisions regardless of what pressure was applied. The so-called pressure being applied to me now is nothing. It is absolutely nothing compared to what I withstood from heavyhanded White House political operations in the past. Let me say, by the way, that most of that has come from Republican White Houses. To just give a few examples, in 1981, as a new Member of the Senate and a brand-new member of the Senate Budget Committee, I voted against President Reagan's first budget proposal because we were promised a balanced budget and it didn't balance. I remember very specifically the Budget Committee markup in April 1981 on President Reagan's first budget. It happened to be that I wasn't alone on this. I was one of three Republicans to vote against that resolution because it did not put us on a path to a balanced budget. You can imagine that when a budget has to come out on a party-line vote, you cannot lose three Republicans, and three Republicans who were elected in 1980 on a promise to balance the budget did not go along with it. What a loss this was for this new President Reagan--that his budget might not get adopted by the Budget Committee. We were under immense pressure to act on the President's budget regardless of the deficits that it would cause. But we stood on principle and didn't succumb to the pressure. As an example, right after that vote where the President's budget wasn't voted out of the Budget Committee, I was home on a spring recess. I remember calls from the White House. I remember threats from the Chamber of Commerce while I was home for Easter break, even interrupting my town meetings. Four years later, I led the charge to freeze spending and to end the Reagan defense buildup as a way to get the Federal budget under control. In 1984 I teamed up with Senator Biden, a Democrat, and Senator Kassebaum of Kansas, a Republican, to propose a freeze of the defense budget that would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the annual deficit. At the time, it was known as the Kassebaum-Grassley Budget or the KGB defense freeze. We were going to make sure that across-the-board budgets were responsible. For months, I endured pressure from the Reagan administration and from my Republican colleagues who argued a freeze on defense spending would constitute unilateral disarmament. President Reagan had put together a less aggressive deficit reduction plan. We didn't think it went far enough. My bipartisan plan was attacked for being dangerous and causing draconian cuts to the defense budget. I knew it was realistic and a responsible approach. I didn't back down. We forced a vote that year in the Budget Committee. We forced a vote on the Senate floor on May 2, 1984, and that particular year we were not successful. However, this effort required the Senate and the Nation to have a debate about a growing defense budget. We started that debate, about the waste and inefficiency in the Pentagon and the growing Federal fiscal deficits. Despite the weeks-long pressure from conservatives in the Reagan administration, I did not back down because I knew the policy was on my side. In this process I stood up to pressure from President Reagan, Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger, Secretary Barry Goldwater, Senator John Tower, Chairman of the Budget Committee, and many others. I remember a meeting at the White House where I reminded the President that he had been talking through the campaign about the Welfare queens impacting the budget. It happens that I reminded him there were Defense queens as well. I started doing oversight on the Defense Department. It wasn't long before the evidence of waste and fraud began appearing. We uncovered contractors that billed the Defense Department $435 for a claw hammer, $750 for toilet seats, $695 for ashtrays. We even found a coffee pot that cost $7,600. I had no problem finding Democrats to join my oversight effort back then, but it is interesting how difficult it is to find bipartisan help when doing oversight in the current Democrat administration. Nevertheless, 12 months later, on May 2, 1985, after a year of [[Page S1796]] work to make the case that the Defense Department needed structural reforms and slower spending growth, I was successful. My amendment to freeze the defense budget and allow for increases based on inflation was agreed to when a motion to table failed by a vote of 48 to 51. A majority of the Republicans opposed me, and a majority of the Democrats were with me. That didn't matter because I knew we were doing the right thing. I went against my own party, my own President, to hold the Pentagon accountable, and I never backed off. I had a similar experience with President George W. Bush in 1991. In January 1991, the Senate debated a resolution to authorize the use of U.S. Armed Forces to remove Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. I opposed the resolution because I felt the economic and diplomatic sanctions that I voted for should have been given more time to work. I was not ready to give up on sanctions in favor of war. In the end, I was one of just two Republicans, along with Senator Hatfield of Oregon, to oppose the resolution. I was under pressure from President Bush, Vice President Quayle, and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu. I was even pressured by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. I heard from a lot of Iowans, particularly Republicans, who were disappointed and even angry with my position. Some were even considering a public rebuke because of my vote. As one of just two Republicans, it was difficult to differ with a Republican President on such a major issue. But as I stated at the time, my decision was above any partisanship. It was a decision of conscience rather than a matter of Republican versus Democrat. After a tremendous amount of soul-searching, I did what I thought was right, regardless of the political pressure. The same is true today with regard to the Supreme Court vacancy. Under President George W. Bush, I faced another dilemma. The President and the Republican congressional leadership determined that they wanted to provide $1.6 trillion in tax relief in 2001. I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance. The problem is, we had a Senate that was divided 50-50 at the time. The parties' numbers also equal, on the Senate Finance Committee. I had two members on my side who were reluctant to support a huge tax cut because they had concerns about the deficit and the debt. As we saw a few years later, their concerns were not totally unwarranted. But, at the time, the administration leadership would have nothing to do with anything except what the President wanted--$1.6 trillion in tax relief. Obviously, the White House wasn't thinking about how many Republicans might vote against it, and when you have a 50-50 Senate, you can't lose a lot of Republicans. After very difficult negotiations, I finally rounded up enough votes to support $1.3 trillion in tax relief. A hailstorm of criticism followed. There were Republican House Members who held press conferences denouncing the fact that the Committee wasn't able get enough votes for the whole $1.6 trillion. Those House Members were more professional in their criticism of my position, than what we currently witness almost every day from the current minority leader about my role as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But, it was still a very contentious and difficult period that included both the budget and the reconciliation process. Minority Leader Reid has already recently brought up the pressure I came under in regard to ObamaCare back in 2009. Of course, his version is his usual attempt to rewrite the actual history. At that time, I was the ranking member of the Finance Committee. I was involved in very in- depth negotiations to try to come up with a health care solution. We started in November of 2008. We had negotiations between three Republicans and three Democrats on the Finance Committee. We met for hours and hours at a time. We met between November 2008 and mid-September 2009, and then the other side decided they ought to go political and not worry about Republicans. The minority leader, in his usual inaccurate statement of facts has tried to say that Republicans walked out of those negotiations on ObamaCare. The fact is, we were given a deadline and told that if we didn't agree with the latest draft of the bill, then Democrats would have to move on. I would suggest that anybody in the Senate who wants some reference on this should talk to Senator Snowe or Senator Enzi. I was the other Republican. Talk to Senator Baucus, talk to Senator Conrad and the then-Senator from New Mexico. The President called six of us to the White House in early August of 2009. The first question I got was this: Would you, Senator Grassley, be willing to go along with two or three Republicans to have a bipartisan bill with ObamaCare at that point? And I said: Mr. President, the answer is no. What do you think we have been working on for 9 months? We have been working, trying to get a broad bipartisan agreement. It's something like 70 to 75 votes you need to get if you really want to have a changed social policy and have it stick. We didn't abandon this until 2009. But my idea is that probably it was that meeting at the White House in early August 2009 where this President decided: we don't want to mess around with those Republicans anymore. We have 60 votes; we are going to move ahead. Well, that happened then in that September. The fact is, we were given that deadline, and we were shoved out of the room. So when we didn't bow to this pressure and agree to Democratic demands, it ended up being a partisan document. That is why it still doesn't have the majority support of the American people. I want the minority leader to know that is what happened, not what he described a couple of weeks ago. Eventually, as we all know, the former majority leader--now minority leader--had his staff rewrite the bill that came out of the HELP Committee and in secret in the back rooms of his leadership office. And we ended up with the disaster called ObamaCare that we have today. The Senate minority leader also recently proclaimed that rather than follow Leader McConnell--and these are Senator Reid's words-- ``Republicans are sprinting in the opposite direction.'' The minority leader also wishfully claimed that the Republican facade was cracking on the issue. Senator Schumer fancifully stated that ``because of the pressure, Republicans are beginning to change.'' You can almost hear the ruby slippers on the other side clicking while they wish this narrative they describe were true. The fact is, the pressure they have applied thus far has had no impact on this Senator's principled position or the principled position of almost everybody on this side of the aisle. Our side knows and believes that what we are doing is right, and when that is the case, it is not hard to withstand the outrage and the pressure they and the White House have manufactured. The pressure we are now getting on this issue pales in comparison to the pressure I have endured and withstood from both Democrats and Republicans in the past. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the bill that is on the floor, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. I thank Senator Thune and Senator Nelson for their leadership. I serve on the Commerce Committee. I am proud of this bill. Our State has a long history of aviation. It was the childhood home of Charles Lindbergh. We are home to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, the 13th busiest airport in the United States. We are home to Cirrus Design Corporation in Duluth, which makes planes and is a very successful company, as well as many people whose jobs and ways of life depend on the aviation industry, not to mention the 148th Fighter Wing National Guard base, as well as the one in the Twin Cities and the one in Duluth. I see my colleague from Arizona is here, so I will focus on one issue, and that is aviation security. Mr. President, 9/11 was our country's wake-up call that our transportation system is a target, and the attacks in Brussels last month remind us that we must continue to do everything we can to strengthen security, and not just in our security lines at the airports but also in places like baggage claim areas and other forms of transportation, like train stations. We need to make sure [[Page S1797]] our soft-target areas, as they are called--like the security lines, baggage claims, and ticketing counters at the airport--are safe. I am a cosponsor of the amendment that passed today that will help address the issue by doubling the number of visible intermodal prevention and response teams from 30 to 60. These teams help provide important deterrent security at potential air and ground transportation targets across our country. This amendment which passed today will also improve existing security systems in airports and train stations by expanding bomb-sniffing dog patrols, law enforcement training for emergency situations, and security in all perimeter areas of the airport. We must also improve the secure areas of airports where airline employees have secure access to what are called sterile areas. In March, as we all know, an airline employee was arrested after attempting to use his badge to enter the boarding area of a terminal from the tarmac, bypassing security gates. He had a backpack with $282,000 in it. In the same month, we saw another employee try to smuggle 70 pounds of cocaine in her suitcase at LAX, and she was caught at a security checkpoint. The most egregious breach of security happened at the Atlanta airport, where airline employees helped to facilitate a gun-smuggling ring and were successful at getting guns on at least 20 flights from Atlanta to New York. Needless to say, there continues to be significant concern, as much as we know that the vast majority of our airline employees are hard-working and good employees. Eighty-five Senators just voted in support of the Airport Security Enforcement and Oversight Act, a bill I cosponsored that would help address this issue of security at the airport, but I would like to add our own story out of Minnesota-St. Paul. First of all, it is a story of inefficiency, so we made a reconfiguration at our airport. There were lines at one point where the average time was 45 to 50 minutes--average time. That was just a month ago. There were passengers waiting for 2 hours and missing their flights. There were simply not enough TSA agents. They were out at a training, which was, of course, necessary because of the inspector general's report that came out this June and showed some severe problems in security at our airports. So we had a perfect storm of people out for training, a new reconfiguration, and finally the spring break travel. But it was simply unacceptable when our taxpayers are paying for TSA. In fact, this Congress authorized $100 million--$90 million more than they asked for in the last budget year. I have appreciated TSA Administrator Neffenger coming to Minnesota, saying that it was unacceptable, saying that they were hiring people with the budget money that was provided. There are also plans to use these K-9 units not just in the perimeters of the bill we passed today but also on these lines. Not only do these dog teams add more security, by working a line of passengers, they actually speed up that line because then those passengers essentially become precheck passengers and they don't have to be prechecked. They become prechecked because of the dogs, and that speeds up everything for all airport passengers. I think we have seen enough of these terrorist attacks across the country, planes with bombs going down in other places. We know this is a danger. We don't want this in our homeland. I appreciate the support of my colleagues on these amendments. We will continue to work on security issues. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Permanent VA Choice Card Act Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the urgent need for Congress to reform how the Department of Veterans Affairs delivers health care to our Nation's veterans. One of the great scandals and shameful aspects of the greatest Nation in the world is the way we treat our veterans. I believe important progress has been made since the scandal in which veterans died, waiting on nonexisting wait-lists for care at the Phoenix VA medical center and VA hospitals around the country, but we have a long way to go to fulfill our solemn promise to every veteran who has served and sacrificed. In the matter of that terrible scandal, I was proud that Congress quickly acted to pass the bipartisan Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act. That bill was an important first step--and I emphasize ``first step''--in reforming the gross mismanagement and lack of accountability at the VA. In my view, the hallmark of the bill is the Choice Card Program, which for the first time allows any veteran who is waiting more than 30 days for an appointment or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA health care facility to receive a Choice Card that they can use to visit a participating doctor in their community instead of being forced to wait with no recourse. So how is the VA Choice Card working? My colleagues in the Senate and I continue to hear from veterans in Arizona and across the country about their ongoing problems receiving care. Veterans find that VA staff don't know about the Choice Card or how to authorize care through it. Veterans are forced to wait on hold for hours with a call center in order to schedule an appointment. Community doctors and hospitals that volunteered to participate in the Choice Program are not getting paid for their services. Veterans who are able to use the Choice Card once and need to use it again have to start all over from scratch. Veterans still have to drive long distances to get prescription medications. There should be no doubt that the VA is failing to fully and effectively implement the Choice Card. In doing so, it is preventing our veterans from receiving the flexible care they have earned and deserve. We know that when implemented correctly, the Choice Card Program is improving care for our veterans. After an extremely difficult start, the VA Choice Card is now authorizing more than 110,000 appointments for veteran care per month--over 5,000 per workday. Each of these appointments represents a veteran's appointment that would otherwise be delayed and pending for months in the VA scheduling system. It also frees up appointments at the VA for veterans who do not use the Choice Card, helping countless veterans receive an appointment faster. We have also seen what can happen when the VA properly reimburses community doctors for their services. In the western region alone, community doctors participating in the VA Choice Program have increased from around 95,000 to nearly 160,000. More than 90 percent of all doctors are being paid within 30 days, and the vast majority of doctors are choosing to stay in the VA Choice Program--mainly because of their love of country--to treat our Nation's veterans. Moreover, we have seen that when the VA is equipped to handle the demand for Choice Program appointments made through call centers, veterans are getting their appointments faster. Recent openings of new call centers have greatly reduced wait and on-hold times among our veterans. Today, wait time averages for veterans calling into the western region call centers for Choice Card appointments are less than 1 minute. As a result of a positive VA policy change last year, contractors are now able to contact veterans and ensure that their authorizations for care are approved ahead of time so that appointments can be made much faster over the phone. While we are seeing important progress as a result of the Choice Card, far too many veterans are still experiencing long wait and on- hold times with call centers and confronting difficulties getting an appointment. Unfortunately, some veterans, veterans service organizations, and opponents of the VA Choice Card cite these shortcomings as evidence that the whole Choice Card Program is broken and needs to be eliminated. These opponents are wrong, and they know it. The problem isn't the Choice Card; it is that the VA refuses to implement it correctly. Instead of working to solve the problems at the VA head-on, the same bureaucrats who have completely bungled the implementation of the VA Choice Card are using their own failures as an excuse to shut down the entire program. Allowing them to do so would only send veterans back to the unacceptable status quo of never-ending [[Page S1798]] wait times for appointments. Does anybody want to return to the status quo? I refuse to send our veterans back to the nonexistent wait-lists that led to the scandal of denied and delayed care in the first place. Every representative in Congress and every official at the VA should too. According to a poll recently released by Gallup, the American people overwhelmingly agree. Ninety-one percent of survey respondents believe that veterans should be allowed to get health care from any provider who accepts Medicare, not just the VA. This chart describes the main problems with VA health care before the Choice Program. Today, military and civilian retirees; Federal employees, including VA employees; ObamaCare enrollees; civilians on employer insurance plans; and refugees and illegal immigrants have the ability to choose their doctors. The only group of Americans who is still being denied universal choice in health care is disabled veterans. How is it that we have created a system where virtually everyone in America gets to choose their doctor except for our Nation's disabled veterans? Our veterans want and need the opportunity to choose the health care that works best for them. It is simply unacceptable that half a million veterans nationwide today are waiting for a medical appointment that is scheduled more than 30 days from now. We can address this crisis now by making simple changes to the law. Under the law, the VA Choice Card pilot program expires next year. We cannot and will not go back to the way our VA operated before the scandal. While some senior VA leaders are aggressively implementing the Choice Program, many others believe veterans should be forced to stay within the walls of the VA no matter what. Making the program permanent will send a clear message that we refuse to send veterans back to the days of denied and delayed care. That is why I introduced legislation to make the VA Choice Card permanent and universal. I believe every veteran--no matter where they live or how long they are waiting for an appointment--should have the ability to see a doctor of their choice in their community. Last week I held a townhall meeting with veterans in Phoenix, AZ, along with Mike Broomhead, a distinguished leader in our community. With tears in their eyes and frustration in their voices, veterans described the unending wait times for appointments and difficulty obtaining and using the Choice Card to receive the care they want and need. More than 2 years after the scandal in care first arose in Phoenix, AZ, and more than a year after reform legislation was signed into law, the VA is still failing our veterans. It doesn't have to be this way. There are additional steps we can take now to reform this broken health care system. That is why I recently announced my Care Veterans Deserve action plan. The elements of my plan address some of the most urgent problems still plaguing the VA. First, the action plan proposes keeping the VA open later during the week and opening the VA on weekends for local doctors and nurses to treat our veterans. This would address the most common complaint we hear that wait times for appointments are still too long. In Arizona, wait times have gotten worse--not better--over the last year, with more than 10 percent of all the Arizona veterans having to wait more than 30 days for care at the VA. Despite these long wait times, veterans are still not allowed to make appointments past 3 p.m. during the week and have very few appointment options on weekends. VA employees abruptly close clinics no matter what a veteran needs at the end of the day. By keeping the VA open later and adding hours on weekends, we can address these unacceptably high wait times and maximize the use of our VA facilities. I have also proposed in the Care Veterans Deserve action plan that the VA allow community walk-in clinics to treat veterans for minor injuries and illnesses such as a cold, the flu, allergies, sinus infections, immunizations, vaccines, sore throats, and minor headaches. Again, this would greatly reduce the need for veterans to visit VA emergency rooms after hours and would free up appointments for everyone waiting for care at the VA. The plan also proposes that we require VA pharmacies to stay open until 8 p.m. during the week and for at least 8 hours on Saturday and Sundays. This would tackle a common complaint among our working veterans who cannot visit VA pharmacies during their limited workday hours to obtain a prescription. It is absurd that a civilian can go to a pharmacy 24 hours a day in most cities in America, but VA pharmacies close early on weekdays and completely on the weekends. I also propose in this action plan that individual VA hospitals undergo peer review from the best in health care: Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic--there is a long line of them--and other top-tier health care networks. I was disappointed that the independent review required by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act only resulted in a high-level review of the VA health care system. Its findings were so broad and general that they provided Congress with very little guidance on what is happening at individual VA hospitals in our States. By requiring the VA to undergo peer reviews from the best in health care, we will have better insight into how to fully reform the VA health care system. I intend to include the elements of that action plan in a bill I will introduce in this Congress. By enacting legislation as soon as possible, we can fix the serious inequity in veterans health care. It is absurd to me and many others that virtually every American receives Federal subsidies for choice and freedom in health care while veterans are forced to wait in line and ask permission from a VA bureaucrat before getting access to care. I thank my colleagues for working with me on these and other measures that will help finish the work we started nearly 2 years ago with the Veteran Access, Choice and Accountability Act and urge passage of my commonsense reforms as soon as possible. Before I close, I want to take a moment to applaud the efforts of my friend from Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Johnny Isakson, for his leadership, particularly on the issue of accountability at the VA. One of the most disgraceful aspects of the scandal at the VA is that only a small number of senior VA executives responsible for the wait-time scandal were fired. This was despite the fact that Congress provided the VA Secretary broad authority to hold corrupt executives accountable for wrongdoing. I look forward to working with Chairman Isakson and my colleagues in the Senate to pass legislation that would ensure we hold all those responsible for denied and delayed care, even the deaths of some, accountable. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. EUREKA Act Mr. WICKER. Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, I once again come to the floor to talk about Alzheimer's and the efforts being made in this country and in this Senate and in this city to find a cure and find better treatments for the scourge of Alzheimer's. Many of you know this is the most expensive disease our country has ever seen; one-half trillion dollars a year in costs to programs that we need to protect like Medicare, Medicaid. This will rise to $1 trillion per year in the lifetime of many people within the sound of my voice unless something is done. I am so appreciative of the some 1,200 people who descended on Washington this week advocating on behalf of the millions of Americans living with Alzheimer's and their family members. I was honored to be invited to their conference and to speak to over 1,000 people in the hotel where they were meeting earlier this week. They then came to Capitol Hill to visit in the offices of Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, and I had a great meeting on Wednesday in my office. We want to reaffirm our dedication to putting an end to this terrible disease. My mom died with dementia. Most of us have family members who have had Alzheimer's or who have been impacted by Alzheimer's. [[Page S1799]] I appreciate the support of my colleagues in this Congress for NIH funding. It is very important to continue funding, to continue increasing the funding for the excellent work done by the National Institutes of Health to fight Alzheimer's disease and fund Alzheimer's research. I appreciate my colleagues voting for a $350 million increase in research for Alzheimer's disease, but of course this falls far short. This is funding that experts say is needed to reach our goal of curing Alzheimer's within the next decade. Along those lines, I have introduced legislation that I think gives us a different way to approach the disease of Alzheimer's. My bill is called the EUREKA Act that involves a prize competition, in addition to everything we are doing in research, everything NIH is doing, and all the research being done around the country. It is a prize competition inviting innovators, inviting people to think outside the box, come forward, and give us their ideas. EUREKA stands for ``Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for Alzheimer's.'' Of course, the Greek translation for Eureka is ``I found it.'' That is what we are trying to do--trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's, trying to find milestones that will lead to a cure, and trying to find treatments to help those suffering from the disease. The goal of my EUREKA Act is to find the best and brightest minds in the country, the best and brightest minds in the world, to come forward and use their ingenuity to solve this complex problem. As I have reiterated in visits with Member after Member, and I have reiterated on the floor, with a prize competition, we pay only for success. Regardless of the amount of money we put on the prize, you don't pay the money until we have success, which is one of the reasons this EUREKA provision wouldn't come out of NIH funding. It would add to it, and we would only pay the money if we got the result, which of course would be far more valuable than the prize. The numbers associated with Alzheimer's are daunting--even worse, chilling. The disease affects 5 million Americans. The number of people with Alzheimer's is on the rise, as we all know. It is the sixth leading cause of death in America and, again, it is the most expensive disease in America: $236 billion this year and $1 trillion per year by the year 2050. Of course, there is a huge burden for the caregivers also. There is good news, to be sure. It was announced last week that there's been an analysis by UsAgainstAlzheimer's, and it showed some 17 drugs for Alzheimer's could be launched in the next 5 years. In Mississippi, the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson has developed a service called TeleMIND as part of its MIND Center. Telehealth technology is being used to attack Alzheimer's, to treat Alzheimer's patients, and make life better for them and their family. Let us try the concept of EUREKA also. Let us try the concept of offering a prize to young minds. Perhaps people from around the world might come to the United States. This might be someone in a basement or in his mom's garage or might be some major international corporation. We don't care. We want to offer an incentive for somebody to come around, think outside the box, and get us to a cure quicker. Prizes have a history of success. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh achieved a nonstop flight between New York and Paris. He won a prize of $25,000 in so doing. In 2004, the XPRIZE--sponsored by the XPRIZE Foundation-- offered $10 million for the first reusable manned spacecraft. You know what happened. It drew down $100 million in investments, this $10 million prize. In 2011, $1 million was awarded for a breakthrough in oilspill cleanup. So prizes work. It can work, in addition to the research NIH is doing around the country. Let me say, in addition to myself as principal sponsor of this act, we now have 39 cosponsors among this 100-person Senate. We are day-by- day, step-by-step getting toward a majority. It is my hope the leadership of the HELP Committee that is now working on the 21st Century Cures Act that came over from the House with an overwhelming bipartisan vote--I hope we can, in a bipartisan fashion, with the leadership of Senator Alexander, with the leadership of Senator Murray--his lead Democrat on the committee--I hope we can make a decision to add the EUREKA bill to the 21st Century Cures Act, to have this extra opportunity, in addition to everything we are doing, to cure Alzheimer's. I would urge my colleagues, I would urge the staff members who might be listening to this, to check and see if their Members have cosponsored this and to help us with an additional tool to attack the problem of Alzheimer's. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Michigan for deferring for a moment or two while I make these remarks. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, it is very hard for me to believe I am once again standing on this floor. I have to come before my colleagues in the Senate to report that despite the fact that we have been building bipartisan support for legislation that will address the catastrophic situation in Flint, we still have one Senator standing in the way of this coming to a vote. It has been now nearly 2 months since Senator Stabenow and I introduced legislation to deal with the catastrophic crisis in the city of Flint, MI. Since that time, we have been able to build a broad coalition of folks on both sides of the aisle, Republican cosponsors who have joined with us to say it is time for this body, it is time for the Senate, to stand and help those in need in the city of Flint, as well as issues all across this country. Senator Stabenow and I offered legislation, along with Senator Inhofe, and a long list of Democrats and Republicans, including Senators Burr, Capito, Kirk, and Portman, have been working very closely with Senator Murkowski as chair of the committee as well. Yet we have one Senator, one Senator who says that is not enough. He wants to have more, and he is standing in the way of the people of Flint getting the help they desperately need. He is standing in the way of children like this young infant who appeared on the cover of Time magazine. To me, those eyes are very compelling, and I think those eyes are very compelling to every American who has witnessed what has happened in that city, who has witnessed the horror and the tragedy of having poisoned water going into people's bodies for many months while the State government dropped the ball. I will say folks around the country have responded. There has been an outpouring of help from people in every corner of this great country of ours. People have sent bottled water. They have sent filters and are providing resources. It is what our country does. It is what our people do when we see people in crisis. We stand and lend that helping hand. We know any one of us at any time could be in that situation. The wonderful thing about being an American is that as Americans we look out for each other. We know we are a community, a very special place in this world, and we look out for each other. That is why people back home in Michigan--and as I travel around the country--people are at a loss and wondering why the U.S. Congress hasn't done something to address this issue. When I tell them we have legislation that will help deal with infrastructure, not just in Flint but in communities all across the country, that will plus-up public health programs to deal with lead poisoning at a time when we realize lead poisoning is not just an issue for Flint but is an issue for communities all across this country and one we need to focus on and probably ignored for far too long, they wonder why we have not acted. When I tell them we have one Senator--just one Senator--standing in the way, it only adds to their belief that this is a dysfunctional place; that partisanship and polarization have prevented this body from doing what is right. We can't forget the people of Flint, and I know many of my colleagues on the Senate floor have not. That is why we have been able to get broad support from both Democrats and Republicans, who have come together and said to both my senior Senator, Ms. Stabenow, and me: We understand it is a problem in Flint, but we also understand it is a problem in other communities around the country. Let us design legislation to deal with that. That is what we have before us. We have legislation that will provide money for those cities that may be in [[Page S1800]] a declared emergency, which is where we are with the city of Flint, but we also know there may be other communities in this country--in fact, we think there will be a community very soon--that will also have a declared water emergency that will be able to access those funds. We also know aging infrastructure is not unique to the city of Flint. It is with cities all across the country, especially older urban areas that have lead surface lines, but there are certainly many rural areas that have that as well. Those pipes need to be taken out. In this legislation, we create a fund that will allow money to be loaned to those communities--oftentimes, communities that don't have a lot of resources but desperately need infrastructure improvement. It is a loan fund that will be paid back to the taxpayers but will extend the money necessary to make improvements that truly will be lifesaving improvements for the citizens in those cities. We also plus-up a number of public health programs from the CDC that deal with lead poisoning in children. The insidious thing about lead poisoning is that once it gets into the brain of a young child--like this child who is looking at us right now in this picture I have in the Chamber--it has lasting effects. It has lifetime effects. We need not only to embrace that child with our love but understand that the child is going to need health care for decades. That child is going to need educational support to be able to pursue his or her version of the American dream that he or she may have. They are going to need to have, in addition to education and health care, good nutrition, making sure the food they eat will provide their bodies with the nourishment that can counter some of the impacts of lead. But it is not just the children; it is everybody in the city of Flint. Senior citizens have also been impacted. I have gone door to door in Flint and worked with volunteers, including the American Red Cross, delivering bottled water to the people of Flint. I never thought I would have to go with the American Red Cross to deliver bottled water to a community because the water they were getting out of their pipes was poisoned--not in this country, not in the United States of America. But that is what people are doing, and filters as well are being given door to door. The people of Flint are appreciative. Please know they are extremely appreciative of the generosity they have seen from people across this country and from FEMA response as well, but they are also frustrated. People can't bathe with bottled water. They are cooking and cleaning food--all of the basic things we take for granted each and every day. It is simply impossible to live just on bottled water and have that bottled water delivered to them every few days. It is not a workable system. It is unacceptable, and it certainly should be unacceptable to everybody in this country. That is why we need to have a long-term solution. It has to be a long-term solution that will fix the problem permanently by making sure the infrastructure improvements are there, lead pipes are pulled out, but makes sure other support services are going to be there for decades. My fear for the people of the city of Flint is that although they have been the beneficiaries of a great outpouring of love and support from people around the country, they have been able to get that because the spotlight has been on Flint and the TV cameras are in Flint. We all know in today's media world that those cameras will eventually go away. There won't be media attention for Flint. There won't be the bright lights of publicity motivating people to do what is needed in the city of Flint. When those lights go down and when it goes dark, the people of the city of Flint will still be confronted with this absolutely catastrophic situation that is impacting them in their homes. It is impacting businesses--businesses that have been rocked as a result of this. People don't want to go to restaurants because they are not sure of the water there. Real estate values have plummeted. This is a different kind of a disaster than a natural disaster if a hurricane goes through or a tornado goes through. Then we can rebuild, and it can be as good as new. Our concern with Flint is that there will always be this stigma attached to the city as a result of this, and if that stigma is there, it is going to make it even more difficult. The people of Flint are resilient and courageous and brave and strong. They will survive, but we need to be there to lend that helping hand. That is why it is even more frustrating to me, given the fact that when we have natural disasters across this country, this body--the Senate--acts. We send money. We help those local governments. The State governments provide help. Now, I know some colleagues have said that this is not a natural disaster, that this is a manmade disaster. All I can say is to ask that child when he or she grows up: Does it make a difference that it was a manmade disaster or a natural disaster? Ask the senior citizen in Flint right now. Ask the parent who is concerned about that child. Does it make any difference? I don't think any American here thinks it makes a difference. There isn't anybody in this country who thinks it makes a difference. A disaster is a disaster. Now, it is true the State government messed up horribly in Michigan. In fact, the Governor's own task force that he appointed to look into it clearly points the finger at the State of Michigan and the incompetence that was shown by the government of the State of Michigan. That is a given. They are primarily responsible and need to step up, and they have. But they need to do a whole lot more than what they have done so far. But even though the State has to do that and must do that, that doesn't prevent us, the Federal Government, from also standing up and saying: We can help as well because that is what we do. It is what the American people expect us to do. I certainly hope my colleagues will help Senator Stabenow and I move this legislation forward. If we can't get around this one Senator who wants to constantly move the goalpost, who wants to change the basis of negotiations even though this legislation is completely paid for--we have used a pay-for that Senator Stabenow fought for, authored to help manufacturers in the Midwest. I fought aggressively to keep that fund when I was a Member of the House. This is something that is important to us, but we know that dealing with a catastrophic situation in Flint and water infrastructure across this country so that we don't have any more Flints is more important. That money will be used to help the people of Flint and communities across this country. Not only does it pay for this, but it actually reduces the deficit at the same time. I think it is important to say that usually when a disaster hits this country, we don't look for pay-fors. We step up and provide money for people in need. We have been asked to come up with a pay-for, and we did--completely paid for while reducing the Federal deficit at the same time. Yet we have one Senator who wants more. He wants more. I don't know how that one Senator can hold up something that has been able to get this kind of bipartisan support and can hold up something that is so important to this child in this picture. How can you stand in the way? If that one Senator does not like this legislation, that is fine. They can vote against it. But allow the other 99 Senators in this body an opportunity to have their say. That is the way this institution is supposed to work. I still believe in this institution. I still believe the Senate can do better than allowing one Member to stand in the way of helping this child and other children just like this one. It is now our task as Members of this body to come together and say: Enough is enough. We are going to help somebody in this country no matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter the circumstances. If you have been hit by a major disaster, we will stand with you. We will help you. That is who we are as Americans. It goes to the very core of our values. It is now up to my colleagues here in the Senate to please join Senator Stabenow and me and our long list of both Democratic and Republican cosponsors. Put this legislation on the floor. Let's vote on it, let's pass it, and let's help the people of Flint and other folks all across the country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. [[Page S1801]] Tribute to Trent Harmon and La'Porsha Renae Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I don't know what other Members of the Senate will be doing at 8 p.m. eastern time, but I can tell you I will be in front of my television set watching ``American Idol.'' We all take pride in people from our own States, but I want to boldly predict that the winner of ``American Idol'' tonight will be a contestant from my State of Mississippi. The reason I am so certain of this is that two talented Mississippians are the two finalists remaining in the ``American Idol'' competition tonight. They say this will be the final season of ``American Idol.'' Perhaps we are only going to have a timeout for a few years, and we will see it back. This is the 15th season of ``American Idol.'' I am so proud to announce to my colleagues in the Senate and to the Presiding Officer that the two finalists are none other than Trent Harmon of Amory, MS, and La'Porsha Renae of McComb, MS. Now, in Mississippi we proudly call ourselves the Birthplace of America's Music, and I think we do that with some justification. From blues to country to rock and roll, our State has produced more Grammy award winners per capita than any other State in the Nation. Elvis Presley comes from Mississippi, as well as Robert Johnson, B.B. King, Jimmie Rodgers, Charley Pride, Faith Hill, and the list goes on and on and on. Last month, I was honored to participate in the opening of the Grammy Museum in Cleveland, MS. There are now two Grammy museums in the country. One is in Los Angeles and the other is in the Mississippi Delta in Cleveland. The Mississippi Delta is a testament to the many musical inspirations that have emerged there. In 1986, Paul Simon sang: ``The Mississippi Delta is shining like a National guitar.'' He sang that line 20 years before the first Mississippi Blues Trail marker was placed, but he was correct. We now have some 200 Blues Trail markers across our State, and I invite each and every Member and all the rest of you to come and visit those locations in Mississippi. But tonight, the entire State of Mississippi will be shining like a national guitar with talents like La'Porsha Renae and Trent Harmon. They are keeping our legacy alive. They represent the wide range of Mississippi's musical influences. It was wonderfully touching to watch the video of their hometown visits, where the people came out to support them, showing off their Mississippi talent and the dedication of their fans. Trent Harmon is from Amory, MS. He grew up on his family's farm, working in his parents' restaurant, the Longhorn Fish and Steakhouse. Growing up in Amory is truly a small town beginning. The town has a population of around 7,500 people. Trent's interest in music was apparent from early on, as he spent his time in high school and college performing in musicals. My wife and I have numerous times been to Amory High School to see Trent Harmon perform in programs such as ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' ``Forever Plaid,'' and other performances. He was a star then, and he is going to be a star in the future. Trent's powerful voice and versatility seem effortless. He can do it all, from southern soul to R & B. La'Porsha Renae comes from McComb, MS, down in the southwestern part of our State. She worked for a call center before auditioning for ``American Idol.'' She has shared with America the details about her story of survival from an abusive relationship in which she had to seek refuge in a women's shelter. Her soulful voice has been compared to Aretha Franklin, and the emotion she pours into every performance is truly show-stopping. She credits her former high school algebra teacher, Angelia Johnson, as one of her biggest mentors who encouraged her to embrace her own signature style. La'Porsha dedicated last night's moving performance of ``Diamonds'' to her young daughter who was in the audience. So when it comes to talent, I believe ``American Idol'' may have saved the best for last, and I very much anticipate a great performance tonight. Millions of Americans will choose one of these outstanding young Mississippians as the latest, but perhaps not the last, ``American Idol.'' Trent and La'Porsha have made Mississippi proud. They have made me proud, and I wish them all the best tonight and in their future musical careers. I am quite certain that both of them will be incredibly successful. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE.

number 53 (thursday, april 7, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1795-s1802] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] america's small business tax relief act of 2015--continued the presiding officer. the senator from iowa. filling the supreme court vacancy mr. grassley. mr. president, we have a unique opportunity for the american people to have a voice in the direction of the supreme court. the american people should be afforded the opportunity to weigh in on this very important matter. our side, meaning the republican side, believes very strongly that the people deserve to be heard, and they should be allowed to decide through their vote for the next president the type of person who should be on the supreme court. as i have stated previously, this is a reasonable approach, it is a fair approach, and it is a historical approach--one echoed by then- chairman biden, senator schumer, and other senators. the other side, meaning the democratic side, has been talking a great deal about the so-called pressure campaign to try to get members to change their position. it is no secret that the white house strategy is to put pressure on this chairman of the judiciary committee and other republicans in the hopes that we can be worn down and ultimately agree to hold hearings on the nominee. this pressure campaign, which is targeted at me and a handful of my colleagues, is based on the supposition that i and they will crack and move forward on the consideration of president obama's pick. this strategy has failed to recognize that i am no stranger to political pressure and to strong-arm tactics--not necessarily just from democratic presidents but also from republican presidents. when i make a decision based on sound principle, i am not about to flip-flop because the left has organized what they call a pressure campaign. as many of my colleagues--and especially my constituents--know, i have done battle with administrations of both parties. i have fought over irresponsible budgets, waste, fraud, and policy disagreements. i have made tough decisions. i have stuck with those tough decisions regardless of what pressure was applied. the so-called pressure being applied to me now is nothing. it is absolutely nothing compared to what i withstood from heavyhanded white house political operations in the past. let me say, by the way, that most of that has come from republican white houses. to just give a few examples, in 1981, as a new member of the senate and a brand-new member of the senate budget committee, i voted against president reagan's first budget proposal because we were promised a balanced budget and it didn't balance. i remember very specifically the budget committee markup in april 1981 on president reagan's first budget. it happened to be that i wasn't alone on this. i was one of three republicans to vote against that resolution because it did not put us on a path to a balanced budget. you can imagine that when a budget has to come out on a party-line vote, you cannot lose three republicans, and three republicans who were elected in 1980 on a promise to balance the budget did not go along with it. what a loss this was for this new president reagan--that his budget might not get adopted by the budget committee. we were under immense pressure to act on the president's budget regardless of the deficits that it would cause. but we stood on principle and didn't succumb to the pressure. as an example, right after that vote where the president's budget wasn't voted out of the budget committee, i was home on a spring recess. i remember calls from the white house. i remember threats from the chamber of commerce while i was home for easter break, even interrupting my town meetings. four years later, i led the charge to freeze spending and to end the reagan defense buildup as a way to get the federal budget under control. in 1984 i teamed up with senator biden, a democrat, and senator kassebaum of kansas, a republican, to propose a freeze of the defense budget that would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the annual deficit. at the time, it was known as the kassebaum-grassley budget or the kgb defense freeze. we were going to make sure that across-the-board budgets were responsible. for months, i endured pressure from the reagan administration and from my republican colleagues who argued a freeze on defense spending would constitute unilateral disarmament. president reagan had put together a less aggressive deficit reduction plan. we didn't think it went far enough. my bipartisan plan was attacked for being dangerous and causing draconian cuts to the defense budget. i knew it was realistic and a responsible approach. i didn't back down. we forced a vote that year in the budget committee. we forced a vote on the senate floor on may 2, 1984, and that particular year we were not successful. however, this effort required the senate and the nation to have a debate about a growing defense budget. we started that debate, about the waste and inefficiency in the pentagon and the growing federal fiscal deficits. despite the weeks-long pressure from conservatives in the reagan administration, i did not back down because i knew the policy was on my side. in this process i stood up to pressure from president reagan, defense secretary casper weinberger, secretary barry goldwater, senator john tower, chairman of the budget committee, and many others. i remember a meeting at the white house where i reminded the president that he had been talking through the campaign about the welfare queens impacting the budget. it happens that i reminded him there were defense queens as well. i started doing oversight on the defense department. it wasn't long before the evidence of waste and fraud began appearing. we uncovered contractors that billed the defense department $435 for a claw hammer, $750 for toilet seats, $695 for ashtrays. we even found a coffee pot that cost $7,600. i had no problem finding democrats to join my oversight effort back then, but it is interesting how difficult it is to find bipartisan help when doing oversight in the current democrat administration. nevertheless, 12 months later, on may 2, 1985, after a year of [[page s1796]] work to make the case that the defense department needed structural reforms and slower spending growth, i was successful. my amendment to freeze the defense budget and allow for increases based on inflation was agreed to when a motion to table failed by a vote of 48 to 51. a majority of the republicans opposed me, and a majority of the democrats were with me. that didn't matter because i knew we were doing the right thing. i went against my own party, my own president, to hold the pentagon accountable, and i never backed off. i had a similar experience with president george w. bush in 1991. in january 1991, the senate debated a resolution to authorize the use of u.s. armed forces to remove saddam hussein's forces from kuwait. i opposed the resolution because i felt the economic and diplomatic sanctions that i voted for should have been given more time to work. i was not ready to give up on sanctions in favor of war. in the end, i was one of just two republicans, along with senator hatfield of oregon, to oppose the resolution. i was under pressure from president bush, vice president quayle, and white house chief of staff john sununu. i was even pressured by iowa governor terry branstad. i heard from a lot of iowans, particularly republicans, who were disappointed and even angry with my position. some were even considering a public rebuke because of my vote. as one of just two republicans, it was difficult to differ with a republican president on such a major issue. but as i stated at the time, my decision was above any partisanship. it was a decision of conscience rather than a matter of republican versus democrat. after a tremendous amount of soul-searching, i did what i thought was right, regardless of the political pressure. the same is true today with regard to the supreme court vacancy. under president george w. bush, i faced another dilemma. the president and the republican congressional leadership determined that they wanted to provide $1.6 trillion in tax relief in 2001. i was chairman of the senate committee on finance. the problem is, we had a senate that was divided 50-50 at the time. the parties' numbers also equal, on the senate finance committee. i had two members on my side who were reluctant to support a huge tax cut because they had concerns about the deficit and the debt. as we saw a few years later, their concerns were not totally unwarranted. but, at the time, the administration leadership would have nothing to do with anything except what the president wanted--$1.6 trillion in tax relief. obviously, the white house wasn't thinking about how many republicans might vote against it, and when you have a 50-50 senate, you can't lose a lot of republicans. after very difficult negotiations, i finally rounded up enough votes to support $1.3 trillion in tax relief. a hailstorm of criticism followed. there were republican house members who held press conferences denouncing the fact that the committee wasn't able get enough votes for the whole $1.6 trillion. those house members were more professional in their criticism of my position, than what we currently witness almost every day from the current minority leader about my role as chairman of the judiciary committee. but, it was still a very contentious and difficult period that included both the budget and the reconciliation process. minority leader reid has already recently brought up the pressure i came under in regard to obamacare back in 2009. of course, his version is his usual attempt to rewrite the actual history. at that time, i was the ranking member of the finance committee. i was involved in very in- depth negotiations to try to come up with a health care solution. we started in november of 2008. we had negotiations between three republicans and three democrats on the finance committee. we met for hours and hours at a time. we met between november 2008 and mid-september 2009, and then the other side decided they ought to go political and not worry about republicans. the minority leader, in his usual inaccurate statement of facts has tried to say that republicans walked out of those negotiations on obamacare. the fact is, we were given a deadline and told that if we didn't agree with the latest draft of the bill, then democrats would have to move on. i would suggest that anybody in the senate who wants some reference on this should talk to senator snowe or senator enzi. i was the other republican. talk to senator baucus, talk to senator conrad and the then-senator from new mexico. the president called six of us to the white house in early august of 2009. the first question i got was this: would you, senator grassley, be willing to go along with two or three republicans to have a bipartisan bill with obamacare at that point? and i said: mr. president, the answer is no. what do you think we have been working on for 9 months? we have been working, trying to get a broad bipartisan agreement. it's something like 70 to 75 votes you need to get if you really want to have a changed social policy and have it stick. we didn't abandon this until 2009. but my idea is that probably it was that meeting at the white house in early august 2009 where this president decided: we don't want to mess around with those republicans anymore. we have 60 votes; we are going to move ahead. well, that happened then in that september. the fact is, we were given that deadline, and we were shoved out of the room. so when we didn't bow to this pressure and agree to democratic demands, it ended up being a partisan document. that is why it still doesn't have the majority support of the american people. i want the minority leader to know that is what happened, not what he described a couple of weeks ago. eventually, as we all know, the former majority leader--now minority leader--had his staff rewrite the bill that came out of the help committee and in secret in the back rooms of his leadership office. and we ended up with the disaster called obamacare that we have today. the senate minority leader also recently proclaimed that rather than follow leader mcconnell--and these are senator reid's words-- ``republicans are sprinting in the opposite direction.'' the minority leader also wishfully claimed that the republican facade was cracking on the issue. senator schumer fancifully stated that ``because of the pressure, republicans are beginning to change.'' you can almost hear the ruby slippers on the other side clicking while they wish this narrative they describe were true. the fact is, the pressure they have applied thus far has had no impact on this senator's principled position or the principled position of almost everybody on this side of the aisle. our side knows and believes that what we are doing is right, and when that is the case, it is not hard to withstand the outrage and the pressure they and the white house have manufactured. the pressure we are now getting on this issue pales in comparison to the pressure i have endured and withstood from both democrats and republicans in the past. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from minnesota. ms. klobuchar. mr. president, i rise today to speak in support of the bill that is on the floor, the federal aviation administration reauthorization act. i thank senator thune and senator nelson for their leadership. i serve on the commerce committee. i am proud of this bill. our state has a long history of aviation. it was the childhood home of charles lindbergh. we are home to the minneapolis-st. paul international airport, the 13th busiest airport in the united states. we are home to cirrus design corporation in duluth, which makes planes and is a very successful company, as well as many people whose jobs and ways of life depend on the aviation industry, not to mention the 148th fighter wing national guard base, as well as the one in the twin cities and the one in duluth. i see my colleague from arizona is here, so i will focus on one issue, and that is aviation security. mr. president, 9/11 was our country's wake-up call that our transportation system is a target, and the attacks in brussels last month remind us that we must continue to do everything we can to strengthen security, and not just in our security lines at the airports but also in places like baggage claim areas and other forms of transportation, like train stations. we need to make sure [[page s1797]] our soft-target areas, as they are called--like the security lines, baggage claims, and ticketing counters at the airport--are safe. i am a cosponsor of the amendment that passed today that will help address the issue by doubling the number of visible intermodal prevention and response teams from 30 to 60. these teams help provide important deterrent security at potential air and ground transportation targets across our country. this amendment which passed today will also improve existing security systems in airports and train stations by expanding bomb-sniffing dog patrols, law enforcement training for emergency situations, and security in all perimeter areas of the airport. we must also improve the secure areas of airports where airline employees have secure access to what are called sterile areas. in march, as we all know, an airline employee was arrested after attempting to use his badge to enter the boarding area of a terminal from the tarmac, bypassing security gates. he had a backpack with $282,000 in it. in the same month, we saw another employee try to smuggle 70 pounds of cocaine in her suitcase at lax, and she was caught at a security checkpoint. the most egregious breach of security happened at the atlanta airport, where airline employees helped to facilitate a gun-smuggling ring and were successful at getting guns on at least 20 flights from atlanta to new york. needless to say, there continues to be significant concern, as much as we know that the vast majority of our airline employees are hard-working and good employees. eighty-five senators just voted in support of the airport security enforcement and oversight act, a bill i cosponsored that would help address this issue of security at the airport, but i would like to add our own story out of minnesota-st. paul. first of all, it is a story of inefficiency, so we made a reconfiguration at our airport. there were lines at one point where the average time was 45 to 50 minutes--average time. that was just a month ago. there were passengers waiting for 2 hours and missing their flights. there were simply not enough tsa agents. they were out at a training, which was, of course, necessary because of the inspector general's report that came out this june and showed some severe problems in security at our airports. so we had a perfect storm of people out for training, a new reconfiguration, and finally the spring break travel. but it was simply unacceptable when our taxpayers are paying for tsa. in fact, this congress authorized $100 million--$90 million more than they asked for in the last budget year. i have appreciated tsa administrator neffenger coming to minnesota, saying that it was unacceptable, saying that they were hiring people with the budget money that was provided. there are also plans to use these k-9 units not just in the perimeters of the bill we passed today but also on these lines. not only do these dog teams add more security, by working a line of passengers, they actually speed up that line because then those passengers essentially become precheck passengers and they don't have to be prechecked. they become prechecked because of the dogs, and that speeds up everything for all airport passengers. i think we have seen enough of these terrorist attacks across the country, planes with bombs going down in other places. we know this is a danger. we don't want this in our homeland. i appreciate the support of my colleagues on these amendments. we will continue to work on security issues. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from arizona. permanent va choice card act mr. mccain. mr. president, i rise today to discuss the urgent need for congress to reform how the department of veterans affairs delivers health care to our nation's veterans. one of the great scandals and shameful aspects of the greatest nation in the world is the way we treat our veterans. i believe important progress has been made since the scandal in which veterans died, waiting on nonexisting wait-lists for care at the phoenix va medical center and va hospitals around the country, but we have a long way to go to fulfill our solemn promise to every veteran who has served and sacrificed. in the matter of that terrible scandal, i was proud that congress quickly acted to pass the bipartisan veterans access, choice, and accountability act. that bill was an important first step--and i emphasize ``first step''--in reforming the gross mismanagement and lack of accountability at the va. in my view, the hallmark of the bill is the choice card program, which for the first time allows any veteran who is waiting more than 30 days for an appointment or who lives more than 40 miles from a va health care facility to receive a choice card that they can use to visit a participating doctor in their community instead of being forced to wait with no recourse. so how is the va choice card working? my colleagues in the senate and i continue to hear from veterans in arizona and across the country about their ongoing problems receiving care. veterans find that va staff don't know about the choice card or how to authorize care through it. veterans are forced to wait on hold for hours with a call center in order to schedule an appointment. community doctors and hospitals that volunteered to participate in the choice program are not getting paid for their services. veterans who are able to use the choice card once and need to use it again have to start all over from scratch. veterans still have to drive long distances to get prescription medications. there should be no doubt that the va is failing to fully and effectively implement the choice card. in doing so, it is preventing our veterans from receiving the flexible care they have earned and deserve. we know that when implemented correctly, the choice card program is improving care for our veterans. after an extremely difficult start, the va choice card is now authorizing more than 110,000 appointments for veteran care per month--over 5,000 per workday. each of these appointments represents a veteran's appointment that would otherwise be delayed and pending for months in the va scheduling system. it also frees up appointments at the va for veterans who do not use the choice card, helping countless veterans receive an appointment faster. we have also seen what can happen when the va properly reimburses community doctors for their services. in the western region alone, community doctors participating in the va choice program have increased from around 95,000 to nearly 160,000. more than 90 percent of all doctors are being paid within 30 days, and the vast majority of doctors are choosing to stay in the va choice program--mainly because of their love of country--to treat our nation's veterans. moreover, we have seen that when the va is equipped to handle the demand for choice program appointments made through call centers, veterans are getting their appointments faster. recent openings of new call centers have greatly reduced wait and on-hold times among our veterans. today, wait time averages for veterans calling into the western region call centers for choice card appointments are less than 1 minute. as a result of a positive va policy change last year, contractors are now able to contact veterans and ensure that their authorizations for care are approved ahead of time so that appointments can be made much faster over the phone. while we are seeing important progress as a result of the choice card, far too many veterans are still experiencing long wait and on- hold times with call centers and confronting difficulties getting an appointment. unfortunately, some veterans, veterans service organizations, and opponents of the va choice card cite these shortcomings as evidence that the whole choice card program is broken and needs to be eliminated. these opponents are wrong, and they know it. the problem isn't the choice card; it is that the va refuses to implement it correctly. instead of working to solve the problems at the va head-on, the same bureaucrats who have completely bungled the implementation of the va choice card are using their own failures as an excuse to shut down the entire program. allowing them to do so would only send veterans back to the unacceptable status quo of never-ending [[page s1798]] wait times for appointments. does anybody want to return to the status quo? i refuse to send our veterans back to the nonexistent wait-lists that led to the scandal of denied and delayed care in the first place. every representative in congress and every official at the va should too. according to a poll recently released by gallup, the american people overwhelmingly agree. ninety-one percent of survey respondents believe that veterans should be allowed to get health care from any provider who accepts medicare, not just the va. this chart describes the main problems with va health care before the choice program. today, military and civilian retirees; federal employees, including va employees; obamacare enrollees; civilians on employer insurance plans; and refugees and illegal immigrants have the ability to choose their doctors. the only group of americans who is still being denied universal choice in health care is disabled veterans. how is it that we have created a system where virtually everyone in america gets to choose their doctor except for our nation's disabled veterans? our veterans want and need the opportunity to choose the health care that works best for them. it is simply unacceptable that half a million veterans nationwide today are waiting for a medical appointment that is scheduled more than 30 days from now. we can address this crisis now by making simple changes to the law. under the law, the va choice card pilot program expires next year. we cannot and will not go back to the way our va operated before the scandal. while some senior va leaders are aggressively implementing the choice program, many others believe veterans should be forced to stay within the walls of the va no matter what. making the program permanent will send a clear message that we refuse to send veterans back to the days of denied and delayed care. that is why i introduced legislation to make the va choice card permanent and universal. i believe every veteran--no matter where they live or how long they are waiting for an appointment--should have the ability to see a doctor of their choice in their community. last week i held a townhall meeting with veterans in phoenix, az, along with mike broomhead, a distinguished leader in our community. with tears in their eyes and frustration in their voices, veterans described the unending wait times for appointments and difficulty obtaining and using the choice card to receive the care they want and need. more than 2 years after the scandal in care first arose in phoenix, az, and more than a year after reform legislation was signed into law, the va is still failing our veterans. it doesn't have to be this way. there are additional steps we can take now to reform this broken health care system. that is why i recently announced my care veterans deserve action plan. the elements of my plan address some of the most urgent problems still plaguing the va. first, the action plan proposes keeping the va open later during the week and opening the va on weekends for local doctors and nurses to treat our veterans. this would address the most common complaint we hear that wait times for appointments are still too long. in arizona, wait times have gotten worse--not better--over the last year, with more than 10 percent of all the arizona veterans having to wait more than 30 days for care at the va. despite these long wait times, veterans are still not allowed to make appointments past 3 p.m. during the week and have very few appointment options on weekends. va employees abruptly close clinics no matter what a veteran needs at the end of the day. by keeping the va open later and adding hours on weekends, we can address these unacceptably high wait times and maximize the use of our va facilities. i have also proposed in the care veterans deserve action plan that the va allow community walk-in clinics to treat veterans for minor injuries and illnesses such as a cold, the flu, allergies, sinus infections, immunizations, vaccines, sore throats, and minor headaches. again, this would greatly reduce the need for veterans to visit va emergency rooms after hours and would free up appointments for everyone waiting for care at the va. the plan also proposes that we require va pharmacies to stay open until 8 p.m. during the week and for at least 8 hours on saturday and sundays. this would tackle a common complaint among our working veterans who cannot visit va pharmacies during their limited workday hours to obtain a prescription. it is absurd that a civilian can go to a pharmacy 24 hours a day in most cities in america, but va pharmacies close early on weekdays and completely on the weekends. i also propose in this action plan that individual va hospitals undergo peer review from the best in health care: mayo clinic, cleveland clinic--there is a long line of them--and other top-tier health care networks. i was disappointed that the independent review required by the veterans access, choice and accountability act only resulted in a high-level review of the va health care system. its findings were so broad and general that they provided congress with very little guidance on what is happening at individual va hospitals in our states. by requiring the va to undergo peer reviews from the best in health care, we will have better insight into how to fully reform the va health care system. i intend to include the elements of that action plan in a bill i will introduce in this congress. by enacting legislation as soon as possible, we can fix the serious inequity in veterans health care. it is absurd to me and many others that virtually every american receives federal subsidies for choice and freedom in health care while veterans are forced to wait in line and ask permission from a va bureaucrat before getting access to care. i thank my colleagues for working with me on these and other measures that will help finish the work we started nearly 2 years ago with the veteran access, choice and accountability act and urge passage of my commonsense reforms as soon as possible. before i close, i want to take a moment to applaud the efforts of my friend from georgia, the chairman of the senate veterans' affairs committee, johnny isakson, for his leadership, particularly on the issue of accountability at the va. one of the most disgraceful aspects of the scandal at the va is that only a small number of senior va executives responsible for the wait-time scandal were fired. this was despite the fact that congress provided the va secretary broad authority to hold corrupt executives accountable for wrongdoing. i look forward to working with chairman isakson and my colleagues in the senate to pass legislation that would ensure we hold all those responsible for denied and delayed care, even the deaths of some, accountable. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. wicker. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. eureka act mr. wicker. mr. president and my fellow colleagues, i once again come to the floor to talk about alzheimer's and the efforts being made in this country and in this senate and in this city to find a cure and find better treatments for the scourge of alzheimer's. many of you know this is the most expensive disease our country has ever seen; one-half trillion dollars a year in costs to programs that we need to protect like medicare, medicaid. this will rise to $1 trillion per year in the lifetime of many people within the sound of my voice unless something is done. i am so appreciative of the some 1,200 people who descended on washington this week advocating on behalf of the millions of americans living with alzheimer's and their family members. i was honored to be invited to their conference and to speak to over 1,000 people in the hotel where they were meeting earlier this week. they then came to capitol hill to visit in the offices of senators and members of the house of representatives, and i had a great meeting on wednesday in my office. we want to reaffirm our dedication to putting an end to this terrible disease. my mom died with dementia. most of us have family members who have had alzheimer's or who have been impacted by alzheimer's. [[page s1799]] i appreciate the support of my colleagues in this congress for nih funding. it is very important to continue funding, to continue increasing the funding for the excellent work done by the national institutes of health to fight alzheimer's disease and fund alzheimer's research. i appreciate my colleagues voting for a $350 million increase in research for alzheimer's disease, but of course this falls far short. this is funding that experts say is needed to reach our goal of curing alzheimer's within the next decade. along those lines, i have introduced legislation that i think gives us a different way to approach the disease of alzheimer's. my bill is called the eureka act that involves a prize competition, in addition to everything we are doing in research, everything nih is doing, and all the research being done around the country. it is a prize competition inviting innovators, inviting people to think outside the box, come forward, and give us their ideas. eureka stands for ``ensuring useful research expenditures is key for alzheimer's.'' of course, the greek translation for eureka is ``i found it.'' that is what we are trying to do--trying to find a cure for alzheimer's, trying to find milestones that will lead to a cure, and trying to find treatments to help those suffering from the disease. the goal of my eureka act is to find the best and brightest minds in the country, the best and brightest minds in the world, to come forward and use their ingenuity to solve this complex problem. as i have reiterated in visits with member after member, and i have reiterated on the floor, with a prize competition, we pay only for success. regardless of the amount of money we put on the prize, you don't pay the money until we have success, which is one of the reasons this eureka provision wouldn't come out of nih funding. it would add to it, and we would only pay the money if we got the result, which of course would be far more valuable than the prize. the numbers associated with alzheimer's are daunting--even worse, chilling. the disease affects 5 million americans. the number of people with alzheimer's is on the rise, as we all know. it is the sixth leading cause of death in america and, again, it is the most expensive disease in america: $236 billion this year and $1 trillion per year by the year 2050. of course, there is a huge burden for the caregivers also. there is good news, to be sure. it was announced last week that there's been an analysis by usagainstalzheimer's, and it showed some 17 drugs for alzheimer's could be launched in the next 5 years. in mississippi, the university of mississippi medical center in jackson has developed a service called telemind as part of its mind center. telehealth technology is being used to attack alzheimer's, to treat alzheimer's patients, and make life better for them and their family. let us try the concept of eureka also. let us try the concept of offering a prize to young minds. perhaps people from around the world might come to the united states. this might be someone in a basement or in his mom's garage or might be some major international corporation. we don't care. we want to offer an incentive for somebody to come around, think outside the box, and get us to a cure quicker. prizes have a history of success. in 1927, charles lindbergh achieved a nonstop flight between new york and paris. he won a prize of $25,000 in so doing. in 2004, the xprize--sponsored by the xprize foundation-- offered $10 million for the first reusable manned spacecraft. you know what happened. it drew down $100 million in investments, this $10 million prize. in 2011, $1 million was awarded for a breakthrough in oilspill cleanup. so prizes work. it can work, in addition to the research nih is doing around the country. let me say, in addition to myself as principal sponsor of this act, we now have 39 cosponsors among this 100-person senate. we are day-by- day, step-by-step getting toward a majority. it is my hope the leadership of the help committee that is now working on the 21st century cures act that came over from the house with an overwhelming bipartisan vote--i hope we can, in a bipartisan fashion, with the leadership of senator alexander, with the leadership of senator murray--his lead democrat on the committee--i hope we can make a decision to add the eureka bill to the 21st century cures act, to have this extra opportunity, in addition to everything we are doing, to cure alzheimer's. i would urge my colleagues, i would urge the staff members who might be listening to this, to check and see if their members have cosponsored this and to help us with an additional tool to attack the problem of alzheimer's. thank you very much, mr. president. i thank my colleague from michigan for deferring for a moment or two while i make these remarks. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from michigan. flint, michigan, water crisis mr. peters. mr. president, it is very hard for me to believe i am once again standing on this floor. i have to come before my colleagues in the senate to report that despite the fact that we have been building bipartisan support for legislation that will address the catastrophic situation in flint, we still have one senator standing in the way of this coming to a vote. it has been now nearly 2 months since senator stabenow and i introduced legislation to deal with the catastrophic crisis in the city of flint, mi. since that time, we have been able to build a broad coalition of folks on both sides of the aisle, republican cosponsors who have joined with us to say it is time for this body, it is time for the senate, to stand and help those in need in the city of flint, as well as issues all across this country. senator stabenow and i offered legislation, along with senator inhofe, and a long list of democrats and republicans, including senators burr, capito, kirk, and portman, have been working very closely with senator murkowski as chair of the committee as well. yet we have one senator, one senator who says that is not enough. he wants to have more, and he is standing in the way of the people of flint getting the help they desperately need. he is standing in the way of children like this young infant who appeared on the cover of time magazine. to me, those eyes are very compelling, and i think those eyes are very compelling to every american who has witnessed what has happened in that city, who has witnessed the horror and the tragedy of having poisoned water going into people's bodies for many months while the state government dropped the ball. i will say folks around the country have responded. there has been an outpouring of help from people in every corner of this great country of ours. people have sent bottled water. they have sent filters and are providing resources. it is what our country does. it is what our people do when we see people in crisis. we stand and lend that helping hand. we know any one of us at any time could be in that situation. the wonderful thing about being an american is that as americans we look out for each other. we know we are a community, a very special place in this world, and we look out for each other. that is why people back home in michigan--and as i travel around the country--people are at a loss and wondering why the u.s. congress hasn't done something to address this issue. when i tell them we have legislation that will help deal with infrastructure, not just in flint but in communities all across the country, that will plus-up public health programs to deal with lead poisoning at a time when we realize lead poisoning is not just an issue for flint but is an issue for communities all across this country and one we need to focus on and probably ignored for far too long, they wonder why we have not acted. when i tell them we have one senator--just one senator--standing in the way, it only adds to their belief that this is a dysfunctional place; that partisanship and polarization have prevented this body from doing what is right. we can't forget the people of flint, and i know many of my colleagues on the senate floor have not. that is why we have been able to get broad support from both democrats and republicans, who have come together and said to both my senior senator, ms. stabenow, and me: we understand it is a problem in flint, but we also understand it is a problem in other communities around the country. let us design legislation to deal with that. that is what we have before us. we have legislation that will provide money for those cities that may be in [[page s1800]] a declared emergency, which is where we are with the city of flint, but we also know there may be other communities in this country--in fact, we think there will be a community very soon--that will also have a declared water emergency that will be able to access those funds. we also know aging infrastructure is not unique to the city of flint. it is with cities all across the country, especially older urban areas that have lead surface lines, but there are certainly many rural areas that have that as well. those pipes need to be taken out. in this legislation, we create a fund that will allow money to be loaned to those communities--oftentimes, communities that don't have a lot of resources but desperately need infrastructure improvement. it is a loan fund that will be paid back to the taxpayers but will extend the money necessary to make improvements that truly will be lifesaving improvements for the citizens in those cities. we also plus-up a number of public health programs from the cdc that deal with lead poisoning in children. the insidious thing about lead poisoning is that once it gets into the brain of a young child--like this child who is looking at us right now in this picture i have in the chamber--it has lasting effects. it has lifetime effects. we need not only to embrace that child with our love but understand that the child is going to need health care for decades. that child is going to need educational support to be able to pursue his or her version of the american dream that he or she may have. they are going to need to have, in addition to education and health care, good nutrition, making sure the food they eat will provide their bodies with the nourishment that can counter some of the impacts of lead. but it is not just the children; it is everybody in the city of flint. senior citizens have also been impacted. i have gone door to door in flint and worked with volunteers, including the american red cross, delivering bottled water to the people of flint. i never thought i would have to go with the american red cross to deliver bottled water to a community because the water they were getting out of their pipes was poisoned--not in this country, not in the united states of america. but that is what people are doing, and filters as well are being given door to door. the people of flint are appreciative. please know they are extremely appreciative of the generosity they have seen from people across this country and from fema response as well, but they are also frustrated. people can't bathe with bottled water. they are cooking and cleaning food--all of the basic things we take for granted each and every day. it is simply impossible to live just on bottled water and have that bottled water delivered to them every few days. it is not a workable system. it is unacceptable, and it certainly should be unacceptable to everybody in this country. that is why we need to have a long-term solution. it has to be a long-term solution that will fix the problem permanently by making sure the infrastructure improvements are there, lead pipes are pulled out, but makes sure other support services are going to be there for decades. my fear for the people of the city of flint is that although they have been the beneficiaries of a great outpouring of love and support from people around the country, they have been able to get that because the spotlight has been on flint and the tv cameras are in flint. we all know in today's media world that those cameras will eventually go away. there won't be media attention for flint. there won't be the bright lights of publicity motivating people to do what is needed in the city of flint. when those lights go down and when it goes dark, the people of the city of flint will still be confronted with this absolutely catastrophic situation that is impacting them in their homes. it is impacting businesses--businesses that have been rocked as a result of this. people don't want to go to restaurants because they are not sure of the water there. real estate values have plummeted. this is a different kind of a disaster than a natural disaster if a hurricane goes through or a tornado goes through. then we can rebuild, and it can be as good as new. our concern with flint is that there will always be this stigma attached to the city as a result of this, and if that stigma is there, it is going to make it even more difficult. the people of flint are resilient and courageous and brave and strong. they will survive, but we need to be there to lend that helping hand. that is why it is even more frustrating to me, given the fact that when we have natural disasters across this country, this body--the senate--acts. we send money. we help those local governments. the state governments provide help. now, i know some colleagues have said that this is not a natural disaster, that this is a manmade disaster. all i can say is to ask that child when he or she grows up: does it make a difference that it was a manmade disaster or a natural disaster? ask the senior citizen in flint right now. ask the parent who is concerned about that child. does it make any difference? i don't think any american here thinks it makes a difference. there isn't anybody in this country who thinks it makes a difference. a disaster is a disaster. now, it is true the state government messed up horribly in michigan. in fact, the governor's own task force that he appointed to look into it clearly points the finger at the state of michigan and the incompetence that was shown by the government of the state of michigan. that is a given. they are primarily responsible and need to step up, and they have. but they need to do a whole lot more than what they have done so far. but even though the state has to do that and must do that, that doesn't prevent us, the federal government, from also standing up and saying: we can help as well because that is what we do. it is what the american people expect us to do. i certainly hope my colleagues will help senator stabenow and i move this legislation forward. if we can't get around this one senator who wants to constantly move the goalpost, who wants to change the basis of negotiations even though this legislation is completely paid for--we have used a pay-for that senator stabenow fought for, authored to help manufacturers in the midwest. i fought aggressively to keep that fund when i was a member of the house. this is something that is important to us, but we know that dealing with a catastrophic situation in flint and water infrastructure across this country so that we don't have any more flints is more important. that money will be used to help the people of flint and communities across this country. not only does it pay for this, but it actually reduces the deficit at the same time. i think it is important to say that usually when a disaster hits this country, we don't look for pay-fors. we step up and provide money for people in need. we have been asked to come up with a pay-for, and we did--completely paid for while reducing the federal deficit at the same time. yet we have one senator who wants more. he wants more. i don't know how that one senator can hold up something that has been able to get this kind of bipartisan support and can hold up something that is so important to this child in this picture. how can you stand in the way? if that one senator does not like this legislation, that is fine. they can vote against it. but allow the other 99 senators in this body an opportunity to have their say. that is the way this institution is supposed to work. i still believe in this institution. i still believe the senate can do better than allowing one member to stand in the way of helping this child and other children just like this one. it is now our task as members of this body to come together and say: enough is enough. we are going to help somebody in this country no matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter the circumstances. if you have been hit by a major disaster, we will stand with you. we will help you. that is who we are as americans. it goes to the very core of our values. it is now up to my colleagues here in the senate to please join senator stabenow and me and our long list of both democratic and republican cosponsors. put this legislation on the floor. let's vote on it, let's pass it, and let's help the people of flint and other folks all across the country. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from mississippi. [[page s1801]] tribute to trent harmon and la'porsha renae mr. wicker. mr. president, i don't know what other members of the senate will be doing at 8 p.m. eastern time, but i can tell you i will be in front of my television set watching ``american idol.'' we all take pride in people from our own states, but i want to boldly predict that the winner of ``american idol'' tonight will be a contestant from my state of mississippi. the reason i am so certain of this is that two talented mississippians are the two finalists remaining in the ``american idol'' competition tonight. they say this will be the final season of ``american idol.'' perhaps we are only going to have a timeout for a few years, and we will see it back. this is the 15th season of ``american idol.'' i am so proud to announce to my colleagues in the senate and to the presiding officer that the two finalists are none other than trent harmon of amory, ms, and la'porsha renae of mccomb, ms. now, in mississippi we proudly call ourselves the birthplace of america's music, and i think we do that with some justification. from blues to country to rock and roll, our state has produced more grammy award winners per capita than any other state in the nation. elvis presley comes from mississippi, as well as robert johnson, b.b. king, jimmie rodgers, charley pride, faith hill, and the list goes on and on and on. last month, i was honored to participate in the opening of the grammy museum in cleveland, ms. there are now two grammy museums in the country. one is in los angeles and the other is in the mississippi delta in cleveland. the mississippi delta is a testament to the many musical inspirations that have emerged there. in 1986, paul simon sang: ``the mississippi delta is shining like a national guitar.'' he sang that line 20 years before the first mississippi blues trail marker was placed, but he was correct. we now have some 200 blues trail markers across our state, and i invite each and every member and all the rest of you to come and visit those locations in mississippi. but tonight, the entire state of mississippi will be shining like a national guitar with talents like la'porsha renae and trent harmon. they are keeping our legacy alive. they represent the wide range of mississippi's musical influences. it was wonderfully touching to watch the video of their hometown visits, where the people came out to support them, showing off their mississippi talent and the dedication of their fans. trent harmon is from amory, ms. he grew up on his family's farm, working in his parents' restaurant, the longhorn fish and steakhouse. growing up in amory is truly a small town beginning. the town has a population of around 7,500 people. trent's interest in music was apparent from early on, as he spent his time in high school and college performing in musicals. my wife and i have numerous times been to amory high school to see trent harmon perform in programs such as ``joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat,'' ``forever plaid,'' and other performances. he was a star then, and he is going to be a star in the future. trent's powerful voice and versatility seem effortless. he can do it all, from southern soul to r & b. la'porsha renae comes from mccomb, ms, down in the southwestern part of our state. she worked for a call center before auditioning for ``american idol.'' she has shared with america the details about her story of survival from an abusive relationship in which she had to seek refuge in a women's shelter. her soulful voice has been compared to aretha franklin, and the emotion she pours into every performance is truly show-stopping. she credits her former high school algebra teacher, angelia johnson, as one of her biggest mentors who encouraged her to embrace her own signature style. la'porsha dedicated last night's moving performance of ``diamonds'' to her young daughter who was in the audience. so when it comes to talent, i believe ``american idol'' may have saved the best for last, and i very much anticipate a great performance tonight. millions of americans will choose one of these outstanding young mississippians as the latest, but perhaps not the last, ``american idol.'' trent and la'porsha have made mississippi proud. they have made me proud, and i wish them all the best tonight and in their future musical careers. i am quite certain that both of them will be incredibly successful. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. thune. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendments nos. 3499, as modified; 3508; and 3505 to amendment no. 3464 mr. thune. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up and reported by number: wyden no. 3499, as modified; collins no. 3508;

CREC-2016-04-07-pt1-PgS1803,CREC-2016-04-07,114,TRIBUTE TO HARRIS WOFFORD,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1803] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO HARRIS WOFFORD Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to extend my best wishes to former Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford as he celebrates his 90th birthday this April 9. Harris is a close friend and trusted adviser, and I would like to take this time to not only wish him the best on this milestone, but to reflect upon his remarkable life. His story is interwoven into the fabric of our Nation; from a young boy campaigning for Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, to a pilot defending freedom in World War II; from a trusted adviser to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and President John F. Kennedy during the civil rights movement; to a participant in the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery; from a peace activist arrested in protest of police brutality during the 1968 Democratic National Convention; to a Senator championing universal healthcare in the 1990s. The story of Harris Wofford is the story of the steady march of equality and progress. He answered President Kennedy's call on a cold inaugural day in 1961 to ``Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.'' Harris's potential for leadership was evident early in high school amidst the chaos of World War II when he founded the Student Federalists, an organization which advocated for a united world government in order to bring about lasting peace. By the time he turned 18, the organization had grown to over 1,000 members in 30 chapters and led Newsweek to predict that the intrepid young man would one day rise to be President. He went on to graduate from the University of Chicago in 1948 and then enrolled in Howard University Law School, finishing his education with a degree from Yale Law School in 1954, just as the civil rights movement was truly picking up momentum. In 1957, Harris joined the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights as a legal assistant to Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame University. When Senator John Kennedy ran for President in 1960, he was asked to join the campaign as a civil rights coordinator. It was during that close election that Harris made one of his most lasting contributions to American history. In October 1960, Dr. King was arrested in Georgia while battling segregation, and in those tense hours after his arrest, Harris Wofford suggested to Sargent Shriver that Kennedy call Dr. King's wife, Coretta Scott King, and offer his support. Kennedy made the call despite the political risk. The news of the Democratic candidate for President--the nominee of a party that still held deep roots in the Jim Crow South--calling the wife of Dr. King was powerful and helped sway many African-American voters to Kennedy, which some feel decided the election. After the election, Harris Wofford joined the Kennedy Administration as special assistant to the President for civil rights and the chairman of the Subcabinet group on civil rights. He helped Shriver in the founding of the Peace Corps in 1961, and, as was common for him, he not only advocated for the idea, but also served as the director of operations in Ethiopia and the organization's special representative to Africa. In 1964, he was named associate director of the Peace Corps. He reentered the world of academia in 1966 as president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury. His career brought him to Pennsylvania as president of Bryn Mawr College in 1970. Later he practiced law in Philadelphia. After 16 years in Pennsylvania, he was asked to reenter the political world in June 1986 as chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. When my father was elected Governor of Pennsylvania that year, he asked Harris Wofford to serve as the Secretary of the Department of Labor and Industry for the Commonwealth. In May 1991, after the tragic death of Senator John Heinz in a plane crash, my father appointed Harris Wofford to fill the vacancy until a special election could be held. After winning a surprise victory in the special election under the banner of universal healthcare, Senator Wofford used his time in the Senate to foster the development of national service and to push for health insurance. He was a key sponsor in the establishment of the Corporation for National and Community Service and worked closely with Representative John Lewis to establish Martin Luther King, Jr., Day as a National Day of Service. Although Senator Wofford was defeated in his reelection attempt in 1994, President Bill Clinton appointed him as the chief executive officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS. His lifelong advocacy for national and community service made him an ideal choice to lead the CNCS into an influential organization, and, under his leadership, the organization's volunteer branches grew to over 50,000 members. After leaving the CNCS in 2001, he continued his dedication to public service and civil rights through his work on the boards of the America's Promise Alliance, Malaria No More, Youth Service America, the Points of Light Foundation, and as a trustee of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Non-Violent Social Change. Throughout his life, Harris Wofford has left an indelible mark on our Nation's history and the lives of those who have had the privilege to work with him. When I took the oath of office for the U.S. Senate in 2007 to fill the seat he once held, I was honored and humbled to have him with me at the ceremony. For over 90 years, he has stood for courage, idealism, and a steadfast defense of equal rights for all Americans. As we look back on the growth of community service and the march of civil rights in our Nation's history, we see the steady, guiding hand of Harris Wofford. I am grateful for his experienced counsel and support on the many issues facing our Nation today, and I am pleased that he shows no signs of slowing down. On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a grateful Nation, I am pleased to once again wish Harris Wofford a happy birthday and many more years of health and happiness. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1803] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO HARRIS WOFFORD Mr. CASEY.

As we look back on the growth of community service and the march of civil rights in our Nation's history, we see the steady, guiding hand of Harris Wofford. I am grateful for his experienced counsel and support on the many issues facing our Nation today, and I am pleased that he shows no signs of slowing down. On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a grateful Nation, I am pleased to once again wish Harris Wofford a happy birthday and many more years of health and happiness. ____________________",package_114_160.csv,6263,6263,6331,"[congressional record volume 162, number 53 (thursday, april 7, 2016)] [senate] [page s1803] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tribute to harris wofford mr. casey. mr. president, today i wish to extend my best wishes to former pennsylvania senator harris wofford as he celebrates his 90th birthday this april 9. harris is a close friend and trusted adviser, and i would like to take this time to not only wish him the best on this milestone, but to reflect upon his remarkable life. his story is interwoven into the fabric of our nation; from a young boy campaigning for franklin d. roosevelt during the great depression, to a pilot defending freedom in world war ii; from a trusted adviser to the reverend dr. martin luther king, jr., and president john f. kennedy during the civil rights movement; to a participant in the 1965 march from selma to montgomery; from a peace activist arrested in protest of police brutality during the 1968 democratic national convention; to a senator championing universal healthcare in the 1990s. the story of harris wofford is the story of the steady march of equality and progress. he answered president kennedy's call on a cold inaugural day in 1961 to ``ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.'' harris's potential for leadership was evident early in high school amidst the chaos of world war ii when he founded the student federalists, an organization which advocated for a united world government in order to bring about lasting peace. by the time he turned 18, the organization had grown to over 1,000 members in 30 chapters and led newsweek to predict that the intrepid young man would one day rise to be president. he went on to graduate from the university of chicago in 1948 and then enrolled in howard university law school, finishing his education with a degree from yale law school in 1954, just as the civil rights movement was truly picking up momentum. in 1957, harris joined the u.s. commission on civil rights as a legal assistant to reverend theodore m. hesburgh, the president of notre dame university. when senator john kennedy ran for president in 1960, he was asked to join the campaign as a civil rights coordinator. it was during that close election that harris made one of his most lasting contributions to american history. in october 1960, dr. king was arrested in georgia while battling segregation, and in those tense hours after his arrest, harris wofford suggested to sargent shriver that kennedy call dr. king's wife, coretta scott king, and offer his support. kennedy made the call despite the political risk. the news of the democratic candidate for president--the nominee of a party that still held deep roots in the jim crow south--calling the wife of dr. king was powerful and helped sway many african-american voters to kennedy, which some feel decided the election. after the election, harris wofford joined the kennedy administration as special assistant to the president for civil rights and the chairman of the subcabinet group on civil rights. he helped shriver in the founding of the peace corps in 1961, and, as was common for him, he not only advocated for the idea, but also served as the director of operations in ethiopia and the organization's special representative to africa. in 1964, he was named associate director of the peace corps. he reentered the world of academia in 1966 as president of the state university of new york at old westbury. his career brought him to pennsylvania as president of bryn mawr college in 1970. later he practiced law in philadelphia. after 16 years in pennsylvania, he was asked to reenter the political world in june 1986 as chairman of the pennsylvania democratic party. when my father was elected governor of pennsylvania that year, he asked harris wofford to serve as the secretary of the department of labor and industry for the commonwealth. in may 1991, after the tragic death of senator john heinz in a plane crash, my father appointed harris wofford to fill the vacancy until a special election could be held. after winning a surprise victory in the special election under the banner of universal healthcare, senator wofford used his time in the senate to foster the development of national service and to push for health insurance. he was a key sponsor in the establishment of the corporation for national and community service and worked closely with representative john lewis to establish martin luther king, jr., day as a national day of service. although senator wofford was defeated in his reelection attempt in 1994, president bill clinton appointed him as the chief executive officer of the corporation for national and community service, cncs. his lifelong advocacy for national and community service made him an ideal choice to lead the cncs into an influential organization, and, under his leadership, the organization's volunteer branches grew to over 50,000 members. after leaving the cncs in 2001, he continued his dedication to public service and civil rights through his work on the boards of the america's promise alliance, malaria no more, youth service america, the points of light foundation, and as a trustee of the martin luther king, jr., center for non-violent social change. throughout his life, harris wofford has left an indelible mark on our nation's history and the lives of those who have had the privilege to work with him. when i took the oath of office for the u.s. senate in 2007 to fill the seat he once held, i was honored and humbled to have him with me at the ceremony. for over 90 years, he has stood for courage, idealism, and a steadfast defense of equal rights for all americans. as we look back on the growth of community service and the march of civil rights in our nation's history, we see the steady, guiding hand of harris wofford. i am grateful for his experienced counsel and support on the many issues facing our nation today, and i am pleased that he shows no signs of slowing down. on behalf of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and a grateful nation, i am pleased to once again wish harris wofford a happy birthday and many more years of health and happiness. ____________________",6263

Mr. President, today, on the eve of what would have been his 27th birthday, I rise to recognize and honor the extraordinary service and ultimate sacrifice of Howard County, IN, deputy Carl Koontz. Dedicated, loyal, and, above all, compassionate to those in need, Deputy Koontz served with the Howard County Sheriff's Department for nearly 3 years. A native of Kokomo, IN, and a graduate of Western High School and Indiana University Kokomo, Carl served his community with dedication as a corrections officer prior to attending the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy and achieving his dream of becoming a sheriff's deputy. Those who served alongside Deputy Koontz describe him as selfless, dedicated, and determined. A respected friend, leader, and mentor, he touched the lives of all who had the privilege to know him, including the students and staff of the Northwestern School Corporation, where he served as a school resource officer. On March 20, 2016, while serving a search warrant, Deputy Koontz and Sergeant Jordan Buckley were shot in the line of duty. We mourn the loss of Deputy Koontz, who succumbed to his injuries, and we wish Sergeant Buckley a quick recovery. Every day, our law enforcement professionals and first responders get up, go to work, and put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. That is exactly what Deputy Koontz, Sergeant Buckley, and their fellow officers were doing in the early hours of that Sunday morning--their job. They put their lives on the line so that we have the chance to live in safety, and we are eternally grateful. Deputy Koontz is survived and deeply missed by his wife, Kassie; son, Noah; parents, Allen and Jackie; sister, Alice; grandparents, Ann and Allen Koontz and Alice and Carl Durham, as well as the entire Koontz and Floyd family and the Howard County Sheriff's Department. No words or sentiment can adequately express our sadness and grief. As a community, we can only offer our prayers, our support, and our continued commitment to honor his service. Deputy Koontz loved his work, and he gave his life to serve and protect the citizens of Howard County. Although he would not have considered himself a hero, Deputy Koontz demonstrated his character daily by conducting himself with compassion, honor, courage, and [[Page S1804]] integrity. Let us always remember and emulate the shining example this brave man set for us and honor him for his selfless commitment to serving his fellow citizens.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate University of Nevada, Reno, UNR, chief of police services Adam Garcia on being named Police Director of the Year by the National Association of Campus Safety Administrators. It gives me great pleasure to see him receive this prestigious award after years of hard work within the university system and local community. Police Chief Garcia assumed the role of director at UNR police services in 2001. Since then, he has worked to expand both the size and diversity of police services and create a safe campus environment where students are engaged with the department. Police Chief Garcia spearheaded the development of services for public notification in the event of an active shooter or emergency situation, a service critical to ensuring the safety of UNR students. Due to the great success of police services, Police Chief Garcia has successfully integrated the department into a regional partnership, serving an even greater community. His dedication to keeping students across the UNR campus safe is invaluable to our great State. I am grateful to have someone like Police Chief Garcia leading this incredibly important department. The Police Director of the Year award is given each year to an individual who goes above and beyond to ensure safety on campus, as well as maintaining a professional and healthy relationship between the department and the university it serves. Without a doubt, Police Chief Garcia's actions warrant only the greatest recognition, including this significant accolade. I am pleased to see Police Chief Garcia recognized on a national level, representing our great State as role model to other departments. It is the brave men and women who serve in local police departments that keep our communities safe. These heroes selflessly put their lives on the line every day. I extend my deepest gratitude to Police Chief Garcia for his courageous contributions to students across the UNR campus and to the people of Reno. His sacrifice and courage earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who have valiantly put their lives on the line to benefit others. Throughout his tenure with UNR police services, Police Chief Garcia has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the highest standards of UNR police services. I am honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating Police Chief Garcia on receiving this award, and I give my deepest appreciation for all that he has done to ensure safety on the UNR campus. I offer him my best wishes as he continues in his role as police chief. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1804] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING ADAM GARCIA Mr. HELLER.

Since then, he has worked to expand both the size and diversity of police services and create a safe campus environment where students are engaged with the department. Police Chief Garcia spearheaded the development of services for public notification in the event of an active shooter or emergency situation, a service critical to ensuring the safety of UNR students. Due to the great success of police services, Police Chief Garcia has successfully integrated the department into a regional partnership, serving an even greater community. His dedication to keeping students across the UNR campus safe is invaluable to our great State. I am grateful to have someone like Police Chief Garcia leading this incredibly important department. The Police Director of the Year award is given each year to an individual who goes above and beyond to ensure safety on campus, as well as maintaining a professional and healthy relationship between the department and the university it serves. Without a doubt, Police Chief Garcia's actions warrant only the greatest recognition, including this significant accolade. I am pleased to see Police Chief Garcia recognized on a national level, representing our great State as role model to other departments. It is the brave men and women who serve in local police departments that keep our communities safe. These heroes selflessly put their lives on the line every day. I extend my deepest gratitude to Police Chief Garcia for his courageous contributions to students across the UNR campus and to the people of Reno. His sacrifice and courage earn him a place among the outstanding men and women who have valiantly put their lives on the line to benefit others. Throughout his tenure with UNR police services, Police Chief Garcia has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the highest standards of UNR police services. I am honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating Police Chief Garcia on receiving this award, and I give my deepest appreciation for all that he has done to ensure safety on the UNR campus. I offer him my best wishes as he continues in his role as police chief. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1804] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING ADAM GARCIA Mr. HELLER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Community Health Alliance's Center for Complex Care, which offers innovative and complex health care services to those in need. The advanced health care this facility provides is invaluable to northern Nevada, bringing an improved quality of life and well-being to those with chronic health conditions. The Center for Complex Care is the only facility out of several Community Health Alliance centers located throughout the Truckee Meadows that offers a team-based approach to health care for patients with chronic care conditions. A health care team, consisting of a primary care provider, social worker, care coordinator, psychiatric nurse specialist, medical assistant, clinical pharmacist, and support staff, address both the primary health care and behavioral health care of each patient. This team serves as a singular, collaborative unit in order to make a comprehensive patient assessment. Effective communication within the facility connects the physical, social, and emotional health of patients, creating a better understanding of the patient's needs. Those leading the way at this center stand as role models to our local community, demonstrating a genuine concern for improving the health of Nevadans. The Silver State is fortunate to have a facility like this available to our local community. In addition to the Center for Complex Care, the Community Health Alliance offers a variety of care options, including pediatric care, women's health care, dental care, behavioral health care, a school- based health center, a supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children, and health care for the homeless. I would like to congratulate this alliance on recently reaching an important milestone, its 20th anniversary. This achievement is well deserved, and I am grateful to have this significant health care resource available to residents across northern Nevada. Those serving at this center have gone above and beyond to provide high-quality care to Nevadans. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Community Health Alliance's Center for Complex Care for all it does for the Silver State.

The Vikings are coached by Tom Billeter, who has led the Vikings to seven NCAA tournament appearances during his 13-year career with the school. Three senior Vikings players, Alex Richter, Daniel Jansen, and Casey Schilling, were named to the Elite Eight All-Tournament team, and all three scored more than 20 points during the championship game.

CREC-2016-04-07-pt1-PgS1808,CREC-2016-04-07,114,PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1808-S1809] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-141. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to extend Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to three marine leagues; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4 Whereas, in United States of America v. States of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, 363 U.S. 1 (1960), the seaward boundary of the state of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico was judicially determined by the United States Supreme Court to be three geographical miles, despite evidence showing that Louisiana's seaward boundary historically consisted instead of three marine leagues, a distance equal to nine geographic miles or 10.357 statute miles; and Whereas, the seaward boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico for the states of Texas and Florida were determined to be three marine leagues; and Whereas, the unequal seaward boundary imposed upon Louisiana has resulted in (1) economic disparity and hardship for Louisiana citizens and entities; (2) economic loss to the state of Louisiana and its political subdivisions; and (3) the inability of the state of Louisiana and its political subdivisions to fully exercise their powers and duties under the federal and state constitutions and state laws and ordinances, including but not limited to protection and restoration of coastal lands, waters, and natural resources, and regulation of activities affecting them; and Whereas, in recognition of all of the above the Legislature of Louisiana in the 2011 Regular Session enacted Act No. 336, which amended Louisiana statutes to provide that the seaward boundary of the state of Louisiana extends a distance into the Gulf of Mexico of three marine leagues from the coastline, and further defines ``three marine leagues'' as equal to nine geographic miles or 10.357 statute miles; and Whereas, Act No. 336 further provides that the jurisdiction of the state of Louisiana or any political subdivision thereof shall not extend to the boundaries recognized in such Act until the United States Congress acknowledges the boundary described therein by an Act of Congress or any litigation resulting from the passage of Act No. 336 with respect to the legal boundary of the state is resolved and a final nonappealable judgment is rendered; and Whereas, through the federal Submerged Lands Act of 1953, Congress has the power to fix the unequal disparity of the lesser seaward boundary forced upon Louisiana by recognizing and approving that Louisiana's seaward boundary extends three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico; and Whereas, as shown by the national impact of natural and manmade disasters such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon BP Oil Spill in 2010, the seaward boundary of Louisiana is vital to the economy and well-being of the entire United States, since among other benefits the Louisiana coastal area: (1) serves as both host and corridor for significant energy and commercial development and transportation; (2) serves as a storm and marine forces buffer protecting ports and the vast infrastructure of nationally significant oil and gas facilities located in such area; (3) provides critical environmental, ecological, ecosystem, and fish, waterfowl, and wildlife habitat functions; (4) provides protection from storms for more than 400 million tons of water-borne commerce; and (5) offers recreational and eco-tourism opportunities and industries that are known and appreciated throughout the world; and Whereas, the Louisiana coastal area accounts for 80% of the nation's coastal land loss, with its valuable wetlands disappearing at a dramatically high rate of between 25-35 square miles per year; and Whereas, hurricanes Katrina and Rita turned approximately 100 square miles of southeast Louisiana coastal wetlands into open water, and destroyed more wetlands east of the Mississippi River in one month than experts estimated to be lost in over 45 years; and Whereas, the economic, environmental, and ecological damage of the Deepwater Horizon BP Oil Spill is already calculated in terms of billions of dollars, and potential longer-lasting impacts are still being determined; and Whereas, adopted in 2006, the federal Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) would provide ongoing revenues to Louisiana from federal oil revenue derived from gulf leasing and drilling, with the first payment in 2017 estimated to be approximately $176 million, and with such monies dedicated to coastal restoration, hurricane protection and coastal infrastructure; and Whereas, despite strenuous objection, efforts are now underway to repeal or amend GOMESA that would result in depriving Louisiana and other gulf coast states of such monies; and Whereas, the extension of Louisiana's seaward boundary into the Gulf of Mexico for three marine leagues will provide a much-needed stream of revenue for use in the state's ongoing efforts to clean up, rebuild, protect and restore the Louisiana coastal area from losses suffered due to both natural and manmade disasters, and will benefit both the state and the entire nation: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the United States to extend Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to three marine leagues;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to extend Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to three marine leagues; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4 Whereas, in United States of America v. States of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, 363 U.S. 1 (1960), the seaward boundary of the state of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico was judicially determined by the United States Supreme Court to be three geographical miles, despite evidence showing that Louisiana's seaward boundary historically consisted instead of three marine leagues, a distance equal to nine geographic miles or 10.357 statute miles; and Whereas, the seaward boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico for the states of Texas and Florida were determined to be three marine leagues; and Whereas, the unequal seaward boundary imposed upon Louisiana has resulted in (1) economic disparity and hardship for Louisiana citizens and entities; (2) economic loss to the state of Louisiana and its political subdivisions; and (3) the inability of the state of Louisiana and its political subdivisions to fully exercise their powers and duties under the federal and state constitutions and state laws and ordinances, including but not limited to protection and restoration of coastal lands, waters, and natural resources, and regulation of activities affecting them; and Whereas, in recognition of all of the above the Legislature of Louisiana in the 2011 Regular Session enacted Act No. 336, which amended Louisiana statutes to provide that the seaward boundary of the state of Louisiana extends a distance into the Gulf of Mexico of three marine leagues from the coastline, and further defines ``three marine leagues'' as equal to nine geographic miles or 10.357 statute miles; and Whereas, Act No. 336 further provides that the jurisdiction of the state of Louisiana or any political subdivision thereof shall not extend to the boundaries recognized in such Act until the United States Congress acknowledges the boundary described therein by an Act of Congress or any litigation resulting from the passage of Act No. 336 with respect to the legal boundary of the state is resolved and a final nonappealable judgment is rendered; and Whereas, through the federal Submerged Lands Act of 1953, Congress has the power to fix the unequal disparity of the lesser seaward boundary forced upon Louisiana by recognizing and approving that Louisiana's seaward boundary extends three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico; and Whereas, as shown by the national impact of natural and manmade disasters such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon BP Oil Spill in 2010, the seaward boundary of Louisiana is vital to the economy and well-being of the entire United States, since among other benefits the Louisiana coastal area: (1) serves as both host and corridor for significant energy and commercial development and transportation; (2) serves as a storm and marine forces buffer protecting ports and the vast infrastructure of nationally significant oil and gas facilities located in such area; (3) provides critical environmental, ecological, ecosystem, and fish, waterfowl, and wildlife habitat functions; (4) provides protection from storms for more than 400 million tons of water-borne commerce; and (5) offers recreational and eco-tourism opportunities and industries that are known and appreciated throughout the world; and Whereas, the Louisiana coastal area accounts for 80% of the nation's coastal land loss, with its valuable wetlands disappearing at a dramatically high rate of between 25-35 square miles per year; and Whereas, hurricanes Katrina and Rita turned approximately 100 square miles of southeast Louisiana coastal wetlands into open water, and destroyed more wetlands east of the Mississippi River in one month than experts estimated to be lost in over 45 years; and Whereas, the economic, environmental, and ecological damage of the Deepwater Horizon BP Oil Spill is already calculated in terms of billions of dollars, and potential longer-lasting impacts are still being determined; and Whereas, adopted in 2006, the federal Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) would provide ongoing revenues to Louisiana from federal oil revenue derived from gulf leasing and drilling, with the first payment in 2017 estimated to be approximately $176 million, and with such monies dedicated to coastal restoration, hurricane protection and coastal infrastructure; and Whereas, despite strenuous objection, efforts are now underway to repeal or amend GOMESA that would result in depriving Louisiana and other gulf coast states of such monies; and Whereas, the extension of Louisiana's seaward boundary into the Gulf of Mexico for three marine leagues will provide a much-needed stream of revenue for use in the state's ongoing efforts to clean up, rebuild, protect and restore the Louisiana coastal area from losses suffered due to both natural and manmade disasters, and will benefit both the state and the entire nation: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the United States to extend Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to three marine leagues; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to the President of the United States, to the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress. ____ POM-142.

CREC-2016-04-07-pt1-PgS1811,CREC-2016-04-07,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1811-S1813] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS ______ By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Udall, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Warren, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Heinrich): S. 2760. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to address certain issues related to the extension of consumer credit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, an American historian, James Truslow Adams, wrote a book in 1931 entitled ``The Epic of America,'' and in this book he coined the term the ``American dream.'' He went on to say this: ``Ever since we have become an independent nation, each generation has seen an uprising of the ordinary Americans to save that dream from the forces which appeared to be overwhelming and dispelling it.'' One of those forces that has been overwhelming the effort of middle- class, hard-working Americans to be successful is predatory lending. Today I am specifically rising to discuss the introduction of the SAFE Lending Act. SAFE stands for stopping abuse and fraud in electronic lending. The focus of this is short-term, high-interest loans, often referred to as ``payday'' loans. These loans often have interest rates of 300 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent. The debt a family has with one of those loans just grows and grows and grows. Consider this: If you take out $1,000 today, a year from now, at 500 percent interest, you owe $5,000. In 2 years you owe $25,000--an impossible sum for a family of modest means. So these payday loans pull families into a vortex of debt from which they cannot escape, and this vortex destroys them financially. These are huge consequences for the parents, certainly, but huge consequences for the children. It does a tremendous amount of damage to American families. This is why many major religions in the world have come out over time--over thousands a year--and said high- interest lending destroys and shouldn't be done, but here we have it, right here in America. Many States, including my State of Oregon, have worked to end this vortex of debt. They have put a cap on the interest rate. They have stopped the every-2-week rollovers, and so they have returned, if you will, small-dollar lending to being an affordable instrument that doesn't destroy families. These tough State laws are under assault by new tactics of the payday loan industry, and we need to address those new tactics. Specifically, the industry is starting to use an instrument called remotely created checks. How does this work? Let's say you have your bank account and you take out a payday loan. The dollars are put into your bank account, and you think they are going to stay there, but now this online payday loan company--and who knows where in the world these people really are; they may be overseas in any remote location, extremely difficult to find, extremely difficult to enforce our laws-- has your bank account number, and that is all they need to write a check to themselves to withdraw the money from your account and put it in their account, an account that is likely to be so remotely located no one can enforce the State laws. In other words--let me say this again--the payday lender, once they have your checking account number, can reach into your account without your permission and take your money out; thereby, having the ability to bypass the State laws. An Oregon law may say if you have interest rates over those established by Oregon law your loan is uncollectible; that it is illegal [[Page S1812]] in our State. Well, these online predatory payday lenders do not care that it is illegal in Oregon. They have your account number, and they are going to reach in and take your money illegally. That is not the only predatory practice that is evolving. These payday loan companies have also established a practice whereby instead of putting money into your bank account, they give you a prepaid card. This prepaid card looks very convenient. You use it like a credit card, a debit card, and we are familiar with that in America, but here is the ringer. They put fees on these cards that add to the 300-percent, 400- percent, or 500-percent interest rate that is already destroying families, particularly over balance fees. You may not know whether your card has $20 or $30 or $50 left on it. Some of these prepaid cards, in other parts of the financial industry, charge for all kinds of things. They charge you to call and ask what your balance is. They charge if you call and ask a question about how the card works or even what the fees are. They charge a fee just for asking what the fees are. Some of them charge a fee every time you use the card. Some might charge an additional monthly fee, but particularly these prepaid payday loan cards are notorious for their overbalance fees. Let us assume you have perhaps $50 left in your account, you buy something for $52, and maybe immediately you get charged a $35 fee, which they can reach into your account and take, but then that is an overdraft fee on the bank, so the bank is now charging you a fee. Then, because you don't know it is an overdraft because they didn't turn down the transaction, you buy a pack of gum for 50 cents, and there is another $35 fee. You buy a hamburger at Burger King for lunch, and there is another fee. So you can see how these predatory fees line up very quickly on top of the 300-percent, 400-percent, or 500-percent interest rates. So here is the thing. State after State has said these are destroying families and we are going to act. In fact, in the U.S. Senate years ago we acted to protect military families from these predatory loans. The admirals and generals came to Capitol Hill to testify. They said: At our military bases these predatory payday loans are destroying our military families, and it is not just their finances. When their finances are destroyed, relationships are frayed, children's opportunities are damaged. We cannot have this type of terrible impact on our military families. So we established a national cap of interest on these short-term loans. It is good we did. It is good we protected our military families from these abusive, destructive practices, but if these practices are so damaging to families in the military, aren't they equally damaging to families who are not in the military? Shouldn't we apply the same protection to every American family we apply to a military family? Don't we value the success of every American family more than we value protection for legalized loan sharking? Certainly we should, in this Chamber, extend to all families in America the same protection we gave to military families. Until we do that, we should at least make sure the Federal framework requires honoring the tough laws passed by State after State after State to stop these practices. I think the total is about 19 States at this point. That is why I introduced the SAFE Lending Act today. The SAFE Lending Act--stop the abuse and fraud in electronic lending. This act does a couple of key things. First of all, it says these remotely created checks in which a company reaches in and takes your money without your permission--those are banned. You regain control of your checking account. Second, the legislation bans the overdraft fees on these prepaid payday loan cards and other predatory fees established through the Commission. Third, it says that all small-dollar lenders have to register in order to be monitored by their States so they are not in an unregulated world out there without people even knowing they exist. Furthermore, it says that every lender of every type has to abide by the State laws. It doesn't matter whom they are regulated by. Finally, it bans lead generators. Now, what is a lead generator? A lead generator is a fake Web site that pretends it is a payday loan company, offers you a product, and their whole goal is to get your bank account number. Again, once they have that bank account number, they can reach in and take funds out of your account. It is incredible that this is true; that you don't have to sign the check. They basically just use your number and ask to take away the money from John Consumer or Jane Consumer and give it to us, and the bank complies and does it. As amazing as that sounds, that is the way the banking system works. That is what these remotely created checks do. So we to make sure that regardless of what your financial regulator is, you have to abide by the State rules, and we ban these lead generators that are fishing for these bank account numbers. Once they have them, they sell them to the lending industry, to the payday loan industry, and who knows what other hands these numbers end up in. I was surprised a couple of years ago when I noticed a charge on my bank account that wasn't something that either my wife Mary or I had purchased from a store we don't go to. I looked at it carefully and discovered the number of the check was out of the order of my checkbook. So I pulled up the copy of the check on the computer, looking through my account on the computer, and I could see the number matched my account, but the name on the check didn't match my account, the address didn't match my account, and the signature didn't match my signature. None of it matched. The only thing on this check was the number of the bank account that matched my bank account, and that is all that is required for someone to reach in and take money out of your account. That type of fraud is surprising as well, but it reinforces the point that once an online electronic payday loan company has your number, they can reach in. That is all they need to take the money out of your account. So we are going to ban these lead generators as another piece of this predatory profile of the electronic payday loan industry. It is why I am introducing the act. I greatly appreciate my cosponsors on this act, and I would like to thank them all. They are Senator Tom Udall, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Dick Blumenthal, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Senator Ed Markey, Senator Ron Wyden, and Senator Cory Booker. Thank you to all of my colleagues who care a lot about ending predatory financial transactions that strip billions of dollars out of hard-working Americans' accounts. We have a lot of work to do on this. We have accomplished some. There is much more to be done. Certainly, when James Truslow Adams said that individuals of each generation will have to stand and fight against practices designed to destroy the American dream, he was talking about things such as this--practices that proceed to undermine the success of America's working families. Let us stop those predatory practices in their tracks and pass the SAFE Lending Act. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Blumenthal): S. 2763. A bill to provide the victims of Holocaust-era persecution and their heirs a fair opportunity to recover works of art confiscated or misappropriated by the Nazis; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2763 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is estimated that the Nazis confiscated or otherwise misappropriated as many as 650,000 works of art throughout Europe as part of their genocidal campaign against the Jewish people and other persecuted groups. This has been described as the ``greatest displacement of art in human history''. (2) Following World War II, the United States and its allies attempted to return the stolen artworks to their countries of origin. Despite these efforts, many works of art [[Page S1813]] were never reunited with their owners. Some of the art has since been discovered in the United States. (3) In 1998, the United States convened a conference with 44 nations in Washington, D.C., known as the Washington Conference, which produced Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. One of these principles is that ``steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution'' to claims involving such art that has not been restituted if the owners or their heirs can be identified. (4) The same year, Congress enacted the Holocaust Victims Redress Act (Public Law 105-158, 112 Stat. 15), which expressed the sense of Congress that ``all governments should undertake good faith efforts to facilitate the return of private and public property, such as works of art, to the rightful owners in cases where assets were confiscated from the claimant during the period of Nazi rule and there is reasonable proof that the claimant is the rightful owner.''. (5) In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, with 45 other nations. At the conclusion of this conference, the participating nations issued the Terezin Declaration, which reaffirmed the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi- Confiscated Art and urged all participants ``to ensure that their legal systems or alternative processes, while taking into account the different legal traditions, facilitate just and fair solutions with regard to Nazi-confiscated and looted art, and to make certain that claims to recover such art are resolved expeditiously and based on the facts and merits of the claims and all the relevant documents submitted by all parties.''. The Declaration also urged participants to ``consider all relevant issues when applying various legal provisions that may impede the restitution of art and cultural property, in order to achieve just and fair solutions, as well as alternative dispute resolution, where appropriate under law.''. (6) Numerous victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs have taken legal action to recover Nazi-confiscated art. These lawsuits face significant procedural obstacles partly due to State statutes of limitations, which typically bar claims within some limited number of years from either the date of the loss or the date that the claim should have been discovered. In some cases, this means that the claims expired before World War II even ended. (See, e.g., The Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin, No. 06-10333, 2007 WL 1016996 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2007)). The unique and horrific circumstances of World War II and the Holocaust make statutes of limitations and other time-based procedural defenses especially burdensome to the victims and their heirs. Those seeking recovery of Nazi-confiscated art must painstakingly piece together their cases from a fragmentary historical record ravaged by persecution, war, and genocide. This costly process often cannot be done within the time constraints imposed by existing law. (7) Federal legislation is needed because the only court that has considered the question held that the Constitution prohibits States from making exceptions to their statutes of limitations to accommodate claims involving the recovery of Nazi-confiscated art. In Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art, 592 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California law that extended the State statute of limitations for claims seeking recovery of Holocaust-era artwork. The Court held that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the Federal Government's exclusive authority over foreign affairs, which includes the resolution of war-related disputes. In light of this precedent, the enactment of a Federal law is the best way to ensure that claims to Nazi- confiscated art are adjudicated on their merits. SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To ensure that laws governing claims to Nazi- confiscated art further United States policy as set forth in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration. (2) To ensure that claims to artwork stolen or misappropriated by the Nazis are not barred by statutes of limitations and other similar legal doctrines but are resolved in a just and fair manner on the merits. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act-- (1) the term ``actual discovery'' does not include any constructive knowledge imputed by law; (2) the term ``artwork or other cultural property'' includes any painting, sculpture, drawing, work of graphic art, print, multiples, book, manuscript, archive, or sacred or ceremonial object; (3) the term ``persecution during the Nazi era'' means any persecution by the Nazis or their allies during the period from January 1, 1933, to December 31, 1945, that was based on race, ethnicity, or religion; and (4) the term ``unlawfully lost'' includes any theft, seizure, forced sale, sale under duress, or any other loss of an artwork or cultural property that would not have occurred absent persecution during the Nazi era. SEC. 5. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, any provision of State law, or any defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches), a civil claim or cause of action against a defendant to recover any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era or for damages for the taking or detaining of any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era may be commenced not later than 6 years after the actual discovery by the claimant or the agent of the claimant of-- (1) the identity and location of the artwork or cultural property; and (2) information or facts sufficient to indicate that the claimant has a claim for a possessory interest in the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost. (b) Possible Misidentification.--For purposes of subsection (a)(1), in a case in which there is a possibility of misidentification of the artwork or cultural property, the identification of the artwork or cultural property shall occur on the date on which there are facts sufficient to determine that the artwork or cultural property is likely to be the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost. (c) Applicability.-- (1) In general.--Subsection (a) shall apply to any civil claim or cause of action (including a civil claim or cause of action described in paragraph (2)) that is-- (A) pending on the date of enactment of this Act; or (B) filed during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2026. (2) Inclusion of previously dismissed claims.--A civil claim or cause of action described in this paragraph is a civil claim or cause of action-- (A) that was dismissed before the date of enactment of this Act based on the expiration of a Federal or State statute of limitations or any other defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches); and (B) in which final judgment has not been entered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1811-S1813] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS ______ By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Udall, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Warren, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Heinrich): S. 2760. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to address certain issues related to the extension of consumer credit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, an American historian, James Truslow Adams, wrote a book in 1931 entitled ``The Epic of America,'' and in this book he coined the term the ``American dream.'' He went on to say this: ``Ever since we have become an independent nation, each generation has seen an uprising of the ordinary Americans to save that dream from the forces which appeared to be overwhelming and dispelling it.'' One of those forces that has been overwhelming the effort of middle- class, hard-working Americans to be successful is predatory lending. Today I am specifically rising to discuss the introduction of the SAFE Lending Act. SAFE stands for stopping abuse and fraud in electronic lending. The focus of this is short-term, high-interest loans, often referred to as ``payday'' loans. These loans often have interest rates of 300 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent. The debt a family has with one of those loans just grows and grows and grows. Consider this: If you take out $1,000 today, a year from now, at 500 percent interest, you owe $5,000. In 2 years you owe $25,000--an impossible sum for a family of modest means. So these payday loans pull families into a vortex of debt from which they cannot escape, and this vortex destroys them financially. These are huge consequences for the parents, certainly, but huge consequences for the children. It does a tremendous amount of damage to American families. This is why many major religions in the world have come out over time--over thousands a year--and said high- interest lending destroys and shouldn't be done, but here we have it, right here in America. Many States, including my State of Oregon, have worked to end this vortex of debt. They have put a cap on the interest rate. They have stopped the every-2-week rollovers, and so they have returned, if you will, small-dollar lending to being an affordable instrument that doesn't destroy families. These tough State laws are under assault by new tactics of the payday loan industry, and we need to address those new tactics. Specifically, the industry is starting to use an instrument called remotely created checks. How does this work? Let's say you have your bank account and you take out a payday loan. The dollars are put into your bank account, and you think they are going to stay there, but now this online payday loan company--and who knows where in the world these people really are; they may be overseas in any remote location, extremely difficult to find, extremely difficult to enforce our laws-- has your bank account number, and that is all they need to write a check to themselves to withdraw the money from your account and put it in their account, an account that is likely to be so remotely located no one can enforce the State laws. In other words--let me say this again--the payday lender, once they have your checking account number, can reach into your account without your permission and take your money out; thereby, having the ability to bypass the State laws. An Oregon law may say if you have interest rates over those established by Oregon law your loan is uncollectible; that it is illegal [[Page S1812]] in our State. Well, these online predatory payday lenders do not care that it is illegal in Oregon. They have your account number, and they are going to reach in and take your money illegally. That is not the only predatory practice that is evolving. These payday loan companies have also established a practice whereby instead of putting money into your bank account, they give you a prepaid card. This prepaid card looks very convenient. You use it like a credit card, a debit card, and we are familiar with that in America, but here is the ringer. They put fees on these cards that add to the 300-percent, 400- percent, or 500-percent interest rate that is already destroying families, particularly over balance fees. You may not know whether your card has $20 or $30 or $50 left on it. Some of these prepaid cards, in other parts of the financial industry, charge for all kinds of things. They charge you to call and ask what your balance is. They charge if you call and ask a question about how the card works or even what the fees are. They charge a fee just for asking what the fees are. Some of them charge a fee every time you use the card. Some might charge an additional monthly fee, but particularly these prepaid payday loan cards are notorious for their overbalance fees. Let us assume you have perhaps $50 left in your account, you buy something for $52, and maybe immediately you get charged a $35 fee, which they can reach into your account and take, but then that is an overdraft fee on the bank, so the bank is now charging you a fee. Then, because you don't know it is an overdraft because they didn't turn down the transaction, you buy a pack of gum for 50 cents, and there is another $35 fee. You buy a hamburger at Burger King for lunch, and there is another fee. So you can see how these predatory fees line up very quickly on top of the 300-percent, 400-percent, or 500-percent interest rates. So here is the thing. State after State has said these are destroying families and we are going to act. In fact, in the U.S. Senate years ago we acted to protect military families from these predatory loans. The admirals and generals came to Capitol Hill to testify. They said: At our military bases these predatory payday loans are destroying our military families, and it is not just their finances. When their finances are destroyed, relationships are frayed, children's opportunities are damaged. We cannot have this type of terrible impact on our military families. So we established a national cap of interest on these short-term loans. It is good we did. It is good we protected our military families from these abusive, destructive practices, but if these practices are so damaging to families in the military, aren't they equally damaging to families who are not in the military? Shouldn't we apply the same protection to every American family we apply to a military family? Don't we value the success of every American family more than we value protection for legalized loan sharking? Certainly we should, in this Chamber, extend to all families in America the same protection we gave to military families. Until we do that, we should at least make sure the Federal framework requires honoring the tough laws passed by State after State after State to stop these practices. I think the total is about 19 States at this point. That is why I introduced the SAFE Lending Act today. The SAFE Lending Act--stop the abuse and fraud in electronic lending. This act does a couple of key things. First of all, it says these remotely created checks in which a company reaches in and takes your money without your permission--those are banned. You regain control of your checking account. Second, the legislation bans the overdraft fees on these prepaid payday loan cards and other predatory fees established through the Commission. Third, it says that all small-dollar lenders have to register in order to be monitored by their States so they are not in an unregulated world out there without people even knowing they exist. Furthermore, it says that every lender of every type has to abide by the State laws. It doesn't matter whom they are regulated by. Finally, it bans lead generators. Now, what is a lead generator? A lead generator is a fake Web site that pretends it is a payday loan company, offers you a product, and their whole goal is to get your bank account number. Again, once they have that bank account number, they can reach in and take funds out of your account. It is incredible that this is true; that you don't have to sign the check. They basically just use your number and ask to take away the money from John Consumer or Jane Consumer and give it to us, and the bank complies and does it. As amazing as that sounds, that is the way the banking system works. That is what these remotely created checks do. So we to make sure that regardless of what your financial regulator is, you have to abide by the State rules, and we ban these lead generators that are fishing for these bank account numbers. Once they have them, they sell them to the lending industry, to the payday loan industry, and who knows what other hands these numbers end up in. I was surprised a couple of years ago when I noticed a charge on my bank account that wasn't something that either my wife Mary or I had purchased from a store we don't go to. I looked at it carefully and discovered the number of the check was out of the order of my checkbook. So I pulled up the copy of the check on the computer, looking through my account on the computer, and I could see the number matched my account, but the name on the check didn't match my account, the address didn't match my account, and the signature didn't match my signature. None of it matched. The only thing on this check was the number of the bank account that matched my bank account, and that is all that is required for someone to reach in and take money out of your account. That type of fraud is surprising as well, but it reinforces the point that once an online electronic payday loan company has your number, they can reach in. That is all they need to take the money out of your account. So we are going to ban these lead generators as another piece of this predatory profile of the electronic payday loan industry. It is why I am introducing the act. I greatly appreciate my cosponsors on this act, and I would like to thank them all. They are Senator Tom Udall, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Dick Blumenthal, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Senator Ed Markey, Senator Ron Wyden, and Senator Cory Booker. Thank you to all of my colleagues who care a lot about ending predatory financial transactions that strip billions of dollars out of hard-working Americans' accounts. We have a lot of work to do on this. We have accomplished some. There is much more to be done. Certainly, when James Truslow Adams said that individuals of each generation will have to stand and fight against practices designed to destroy the American dream, he was talking about things such as this--practices that proceed to undermine the success of America's working families. Let us stop those predatory practices in their tracks and pass the SAFE Lending Act. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Blumenthal): S. 2763. A bill to provide the victims of Holocaust-era persecution and their heirs a fair opportunity to recover works of art confiscated or misappropriated by the Nazis; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2763 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is estimated that the Nazis confiscated or otherwise misappropriated as many as 650,000 works of art throughout Europe as part of their genocidal campaign against the Jewish people and other persecuted groups. This has been described as the ``greatest displacement of art in human history''. (2) Following World War II, the United States and its allies attempted to return the stolen artworks to their countries of origin. Despite these efforts, many works of art [[Page S1813]] were never reunited with their owners. Some of the art has since been discovered in the United States. (3) In 1998, the United States convened a conference with 44 nations in Washington, D.C., known as the Washington Conference, which produced Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. One of these principles is that ``steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution'' to claims involving such art that has not been restituted if the owners or their heirs can be identified. (4) The same year, Congress enacted the Holocaust Victims Redress Act (Public Law 105-158, 112 Stat. 15), which expressed the sense of Congress that ``all governments should undertake good faith efforts to facilitate the return of private and public property, such as works of art, to the rightful owners in cases where assets were confiscated from the claimant during the period of Nazi rule and there is reasonable proof that the claimant is the rightful owner.''. (5) In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, with 45 other nations. At the conclusion of this conference, the participating nations issued the Terezin Declaration, which reaffirmed the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi- Confiscated Art and urged all participants ``to ensure that their legal systems or alternative processes, while taking into account the different legal traditions, facilitate just and fair solutions with regard to Nazi-confiscated and looted art, and to make certain that claims to recover such art are resolved expeditiously and based on the facts and merits of the claims and all the relevant documents submitted by all parties.''. The Declaration also urged participants to ``consider all relevant issues when applying various legal provisions that may impede the restitution of art and cultural property, in order to achieve just and fair solutions, as well as alternative dispute resolution, where appropriate under law.''. (6) Numerous victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs have taken legal action to recover Nazi-confiscated art. These lawsuits face significant procedural obstacles partly due to State statutes of limitations, which typically bar claims within some limited number of years from either the date of the loss or the date that the claim should have been discovered. In some cases, this means that the claims expired before World War II even ended. (See, e.g., The Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin, No. 06-10333, 2007 WL 1016996 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2007)). The unique and horrific circumstances of World War II and the Holocaust make statutes of limitations and other time-based procedural defenses especially burdensome to the victims and their heirs. Those seeking recovery of Nazi-confiscated art must painstakingly piece together their cases from a fragmentary historical record ravaged by persecution, war, and genocide. This costly process often cannot be done within the time constraints imposed by existing law. (7) Federal legislation is needed because the only court that has considered the question held that the Constitution prohibits States from making exceptions to their statutes of limitations to accommodate claims involving the recovery of Nazi-confiscated art. In Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art, 592 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California law that extended the State statute of limitations for claims seeking recovery of Holocaust-era artwork. The Court held that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the Federal Government's exclusive authority over foreign affairs, which includes the resolution of war-related disputes. In light of this precedent, the enactment of a Federal law is the best way to ensure that claims to Nazi- confiscated art are adjudicated on their merits. SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To ensure that laws governing claims to Nazi- confiscated art further United States policy as set forth in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration. (2) To ensure that claims to artwork stolen or misappropriated by the Nazis are not barred by statutes of limitations and other similar legal doctrines but are resolved in a just and fair manner on the merits. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act-- (1) the term ``actual discovery'' does not include any constructive knowledge imputed by law; (2) the term ``artwork or other cultural property'' includes any painting, sculpture, drawing, work of graphic art, print, multiples, book, manuscript, archive, or sacred or ceremonial object; (3) the term ``persecution during the Nazi era'' means any persecution by the Nazis or their allies during the period from January 1, 1933, to December 31, 1945, that was based on race, ethnicity, or religion; and (4) the term ``unlawfully lost'' includes any theft, seizure, forced sale, sale under duress, or any other loss of an artwork or cultural property that would not have occurred absent persecution during the Nazi era. SEC. 5. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, any provision of State law, or any defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches), a civil claim or cause of action against a defendant to recover any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era or for damages for the taking or detaining of any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era may be commenced not later than 6 years after the actual discovery by the claimant or the agent of the claimant of-- (1) the identity and location of the artwork or cultural property; and (2) information or facts sufficient to indicate that the claimant has a claim for a possessory interest in the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost. (b) Possible Misidentification.--For purposes of subsection (a)(1), in a case in which there is a possibility of misidentification of the artwork or cultural property, the identification of the artwork or cultural property shall occur on the date on which there are facts sufficient to determine that the artwork or cultural property is likely to be the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost. (c) Applicability.-- (1) In general.--Subsection (a) shall apply to any civil claim or cause of action (including a civil claim or cause of action described in paragraph (2)) that is-- (A) pending on the date of enactment of this Act; or (B) filed during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2026. (2) Inclusion of previously dismissed claims.--A civil claim or cause of action described in this paragraph is a civil claim or cause of action-- (A) that was dismissed before the date of enactment of this Act based on the expiration of a Federal or State statute of limitations or any other defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches); and (B) in which final judgment has not been entered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1811-S1813] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS ______ By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Udall, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Warren, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Heinrich): S. 2760.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2763 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is estimated that the Nazis confiscated or otherwise misappropriated as many as 650,000 works of art throughout Europe as part of their genocidal campaign against the Jewish people and other persecuted groups. This has been described as the ``greatest displacement of art in human history''. (2) Following World War II, the United States and its allies attempted to return the stolen artworks to their countries of origin. Despite these efforts, many works of art [[Page S1813]] were never reunited with their owners. Some of the art has since been discovered in the United States. (3) In 1998, the United States convened a conference with 44 nations in Washington, D.C., known as the Washington Conference, which produced Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. One of these principles is that ``steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution'' to claims involving such art that has not been restituted if the owners or their heirs can be identified. (4) The same year, Congress enacted the Holocaust Victims Redress Act (Public Law 105-158, 112 Stat. 15), which expressed the sense of Congress that ``all governments should undertake good faith efforts to facilitate the return of private and public property, such as works of art, to the rightful owners in cases where assets were confiscated from the claimant during the period of Nazi rule and there is reasonable proof that the claimant is the rightful owner.''. (5) In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, with 45 other nations. At the conclusion of this conference, the participating nations issued the Terezin Declaration, which reaffirmed the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi- Confiscated Art and urged all participants ``to ensure that their legal systems or alternative processes, while taking into account the different legal traditions, facilitate just and fair solutions with regard to Nazi-confiscated and looted art, and to make certain that claims to recover such art are resolved expeditiously and based on the facts and merits of the claims and all the relevant documents submitted by all parties.''. The Declaration also urged participants to ``consider all relevant issues when applying various legal provisions that may impede the restitution of art and cultural property, in order to achieve just and fair solutions, as well as alternative dispute resolution, where appropriate under law.''. (6) Numerous victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs have taken legal action to recover Nazi-confiscated art. These lawsuits face significant procedural obstacles partly due to State statutes of limitations, which typically bar claims within some limited number of years from either the date of the loss or the date that the claim should have been discovered. In some cases, this means that the claims expired before World War II even ended. (See, e.g., The Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin, No. 06-10333, 2007 WL 1016996 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2007)). The unique and horrific circumstances of World War II and the Holocaust make statutes of limitations and other time-based procedural defenses especially burdensome to the victims and their heirs. Those seeking recovery of Nazi-confiscated art must painstakingly piece together their cases from a fragmentary historical record ravaged by persecution, war, and genocide. This costly process often cannot be done within the time constraints imposed by existing law. (7) Federal legislation is needed because the only court that has considered the question held that the Constitution prohibits States from making exceptions to their statutes of limitations to accommodate claims involving the recovery of Nazi-confiscated art. In Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art, 592 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California law that extended the State statute of limitations for claims seeking recovery of Holocaust-era artwork. The Court held that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the Federal Government's exclusive authority over foreign affairs, which includes the resolution of war-related disputes. In light of this precedent, the enactment of a Federal law is the best way to ensure that claims to Nazi- confiscated art are adjudicated on their merits. SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To ensure that laws governing claims to Nazi- confiscated art further United States policy as set forth in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration. (2) To ensure that claims to artwork stolen or misappropriated by the Nazis are not barred by statutes of limitations and other similar legal doctrines but are resolved in a just and fair manner on the merits. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act-- (1) the term ``actual discovery'' does not include any constructive knowledge imputed by law; (2) the term ``artwork or other cultural property'' includes any painting, sculpture, drawing, work of graphic art, print, multiples, book, manuscript, archive, or sacred or ceremonial object; (3) the term ``persecution during the Nazi era'' means any persecution by the Nazis or their allies during the period from January 1, 1933, to December 31, 1945, that was based on race, ethnicity, or religion; and (4) the term ``unlawfully lost'' includes any theft, seizure, forced sale, sale under duress, or any other loss of an artwork or cultural property that would not have occurred absent persecution during the Nazi era. SEC. 5. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, any provision of State law, or any defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches), a civil claim or cause of action against a defendant to recover any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era or for damages for the taking or detaining of any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era may be commenced not later than 6 years after the actual discovery by the claimant or the agent of the claimant of-- (1) the identity and location of the artwork or cultural property; and (2) information or facts sufficient to indicate that the claimant has a claim for a possessory interest in the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost. (b) Possible Misidentification.--For purposes of subsection (a)(1), in a case in which there is a possibility of misidentification of the artwork or cultural property, the identification of the artwork or cultural property shall occur on the date on which there are facts sufficient to determine that the artwork or cultural property is likely to be the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost. (c) Applicability.-- (1) In general.--Subsection (a) shall apply to any civil claim or cause of action (including a civil claim or cause of action described in paragraph (2)) that is-- (A) pending on the date of enactment of this Act; or (B) filed during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2026. (2) Inclusion of previously dismissed claims.--A civil claim or cause of action described in this paragraph is a civil claim or cause of action-- (A) that was dismissed before the date of enactment of this Act based on the expiration of a Federal or State statute of limitations or any other defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches); and (B) in which final judgment has not been entered. ____________________",package_114_160.csv,19547,19547,19615,"[congressional record volume 162, number 53 (thursday, april 7, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1811-s1813] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions ______ by mr. merkley (for himself, mr. udall, mr. sanders, mr. franken, mrs. murray, mr. wyden, mr. durbin, mr. blumenthal, ms. warren, ms. baldwin, mr. markey, mr. booker, and mr. heinrich): s. 2760. a bill to amend the truth in lending act to address certain issues related to the extension of consumer credit, and for other purposes; to the committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs. mr. merkley. mr. president, an american historian, james truslow adams, wrote a book in 1931 entitled ``the epic of america,'' and in this book he coined the term the ``american dream.'' he went on to say this: ``ever since we have become an independent nation, each generation has seen an uprising of the ordinary americans to save that dream from the forces which appeared to be overwhelming and dispelling it.'' one of those forces that has been overwhelming the effort of middle- class, hard-working americans to be successful is predatory lending. today i am specifically rising to discuss the introduction of the safe lending act. safe stands for stopping abuse and fraud in electronic lending. the focus of this is short-term, high-interest loans, often referred to as ``payday'' loans. these loans often have interest rates of 300 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent. the debt a family has with one of those loans just grows and grows and grows. consider this: if you take out $1,000 today, a year from now, at 500 percent interest, you owe $5,000. in 2 years you owe $25,000--an impossible sum for a family of modest means. so these payday loans pull families into a vortex of debt from which they cannot escape, and this vortex destroys them financially. these are huge consequences for the parents, certainly, but huge consequences for the children. it does a tremendous amount of damage to american families. this is why many major religions in the world have come out over time--over thousands a year--and said high- interest lending destroys and shouldn't be done, but here we have it, right here in america. many states, including my state of oregon, have worked to end this vortex of debt. they have put a cap on the interest rate. they have stopped the every-2-week rollovers, and so they have returned, if you will, small-dollar lending to being an affordable instrument that doesn't destroy families. these tough state laws are under assault by new tactics of the payday loan industry, and we need to address those new tactics. specifically, the industry is starting to use an instrument called remotely created checks. how does this work? let's say you have your bank account and you take out a payday loan. the dollars are put into your bank account, and you think they are going to stay there, but now this online payday loan company--and who knows where in the world these people really are; they may be overseas in any remote location, extremely difficult to find, extremely difficult to enforce our laws-- has your bank account number, and that is all they need to write a check to themselves to withdraw the money from your account and put it in their account, an account that is likely to be so remotely located no one can enforce the state laws. in other words--let me say this again--the payday lender, once they have your checking account number, can reach into your account without your permission and take your money out; thereby, having the ability to bypass the state laws. an oregon law may say if you have interest rates over those established by oregon law your loan is uncollectible; that it is illegal [[page s1812]] in our state. well, these online predatory payday lenders do not care that it is illegal in oregon. they have your account number, and they are going to reach in and take your money illegally. that is not the only predatory practice that is evolving. these payday loan companies have also established a practice whereby instead of putting money into your bank account, they give you a prepaid card. this prepaid card looks very convenient. you use it like a credit card, a debit card, and we are familiar with that in america, but here is the ringer. they put fees on these cards that add to the 300-percent, 400- percent, or 500-percent interest rate that is already destroying families, particularly over balance fees. you may not know whether your card has $20 or $30 or $50 left on it. some of these prepaid cards, in other parts of the financial industry, charge for all kinds of things. they charge you to call and ask what your balance is. they charge if you call and ask a question about how the card works or even what the fees are. they charge a fee just for asking what the fees are. some of them charge a fee every time you use the card. some might charge an additional monthly fee, but particularly these prepaid payday loan cards are notorious for their overbalance fees. let us assume you have perhaps $50 left in your account, you buy something for $52, and maybe immediately you get charged a $35 fee, which they can reach into your account and take, but then that is an overdraft fee on the bank, so the bank is now charging you a fee. then, because you don't know it is an overdraft because they didn't turn down the transaction, you buy a pack of gum for 50 cents, and there is another $35 fee. you buy a hamburger at burger king for lunch, and there is another fee. so you can see how these predatory fees line up very quickly on top of the 300-percent, 400-percent, or 500-percent interest rates. so here is the thing. state after state has said these are destroying families and we are going to act. in fact, in the u.s. senate years ago we acted to protect military families from these predatory loans. the admirals and generals came to capitol hill to testify. they said: at our military bases these predatory payday loans are destroying our military families, and it is not just their finances. when their finances are destroyed, relationships are frayed, children's opportunities are damaged. we cannot have this type of terrible impact on our military families. so we established a national cap of interest on these short-term loans. it is good we did. it is good we protected our military families from these abusive, destructive practices, but if these practices are so damaging to families in the military, aren't they equally damaging to families who are not in the military? shouldn't we apply the same protection to every american family we apply to a military family? don't we value the success of every american family more than we value protection for legalized loan sharking? certainly we should, in this chamber, extend to all families in america the same protection we gave to military families. until we do that, we should at least make sure the federal framework requires honoring the tough laws passed by state after state after state to stop these practices. i think the total is about 19 states at this point. that is why i introduced the safe lending act today. the safe lending act--stop the abuse and fraud in electronic lending. this act does a couple of key things. first of all, it says these remotely created checks in which a company reaches in and takes your money without your permission--those are banned. you regain control of your checking account. second, the legislation bans the overdraft fees on these prepaid payday loan cards and other predatory fees established through the commission. third, it says that all small-dollar lenders have to register in order to be monitored by their states so they are not in an unregulated world out there without people even knowing they exist. furthermore, it says that every lender of every type has to abide by the state laws. it doesn't matter whom they are regulated by. finally, it bans lead generators. now, what is a lead generator? a lead generator is a fake web site that pretends it is a payday loan company, offers you a product, and their whole goal is to get your bank account number. again, once they have that bank account number, they can reach in and take funds out of your account. it is incredible that this is true; that you don't have to sign the check. they basically just use your number and ask to take away the money from john consumer or jane consumer and give it to us, and the bank complies and does it. as amazing as that sounds, that is the way the banking system works. that is what these remotely created checks do. so we to make sure that regardless of what your financial regulator is, you have to abide by the state rules, and we ban these lead generators that are fishing for these bank account numbers. once they have them, they sell them to the lending industry, to the payday loan industry, and who knows what other hands these numbers end up in. i was surprised a couple of years ago when i noticed a charge on my bank account that wasn't something that either my wife mary or i had purchased from a store we don't go to. i looked at it carefully and discovered the number of the check was out of the order of my checkbook. so i pulled up the copy of the check on the computer, looking through my account on the computer, and i could see the number matched my account, but the name on the check didn't match my account, the address didn't match my account, and the signature didn't match my signature. none of it matched. the only thing on this check was the number of the bank account that matched my bank account, and that is all that is required for someone to reach in and take money out of your account. that type of fraud is surprising as well, but it reinforces the point that once an online electronic payday loan company has your number, they can reach in. that is all they need to take the money out of your account. so we are going to ban these lead generators as another piece of this predatory profile of the electronic payday loan industry. it is why i am introducing the act. i greatly appreciate my cosponsors on this act, and i would like to thank them all. they are senator tom udall, senator bernie sanders, senator patty murray, senator dick durbin, senator dick blumenthal, senator elizabeth warren, senator tammy baldwin, senator ed markey, senator ron wyden, and senator cory booker. thank you to all of my colleagues who care a lot about ending predatory financial transactions that strip billions of dollars out of hard-working americans' accounts. we have a lot of work to do on this. we have accomplished some. there is much more to be done. certainly, when james truslow adams said that individuals of each generation will have to stand and fight against practices designed to destroy the american dream, he was talking about things such as this--practices that proceed to undermine the success of america's working families. let us stop those predatory practices in their tracks and pass the safe lending act. ______ by mr. cornyn (for himself, mr. cruz, mr. schumer, and mr. blumenthal): s. 2763. a bill to provide the victims of holocaust-era persecution and their heirs a fair opportunity to recover works of art confiscated or misappropriated by the nazis; to the committee on the judiciary. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: s. 2763 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``holocaust expropriated art recovery act of 2016''. sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) it is estimated that the nazis confiscated or otherwise misappropriated as many as 650,000 works of art throughout europe as part of their genocidal campaign against the jewish people and other persecuted groups. this has been described as the ``greatest displacement of art in human history''.

CREC-2016-04-07-pt1-PgS1811-2,CREC-2016-04-07,114,Introductory Statement on S. 2760,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1811-S1812] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Udall, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Warren, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Heinrich): S. 2760. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to address certain issues related to the extension of consumer credit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, an American historian, James Truslow Adams, wrote a book in 1931 entitled ``The Epic of America,'' and in this book he coined the term the ``American dream.'' He went on to say this: ``Ever since we have become an independent nation, each generation has seen an uprising of the ordinary Americans to save that dream from the forces which appeared to be overwhelming and dispelling it.'' One of those forces that has been overwhelming the effort of middle- class, hard-working Americans to be successful is predatory lending. Today I am specifically rising to discuss the introduction of the SAFE Lending Act. SAFE stands for stopping abuse and fraud in electronic lending. The focus of this is short-term, high-interest loans, often referred to as ``payday'' loans. These loans often have interest rates of 300 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent. The debt a family has with one of those loans just grows and grows and grows. Consider this: If you take out $1,000 today, a year from now, at 500 percent interest, you owe $5,000. In 2 years you owe $25,000--an impossible sum for a family of modest means. So these payday loans pull families into a vortex of debt from which they cannot escape, and this vortex destroys them financially. These are huge consequences for the parents, certainly, but huge consequences for the children. It does a tremendous amount of damage to American families. This is why many major religions in the world have come out over time--over thousands a year--and said high- interest lending destroys and shouldn't be done, but here we have it, right here in America. Many States, including my State of Oregon, have worked to end this vortex of debt. They have put a cap on the interest rate. They have stopped the every-2-week rollovers, and so they have returned, if you will, small-dollar lending to being an affordable instrument that doesn't destroy families. These tough State laws are under assault by new tactics of the payday loan industry, and we need to address those new tactics. Specifically, the industry is starting to use an instrument called remotely created checks. How does this work? Let's say you have your bank account and you take out a payday loan. The dollars are put into your bank account, and you think they are going to stay there, but now this online payday loan company--and who knows where in the world these people really are; they may be overseas in any remote location, extremely difficult to find, extremely difficult to enforce our laws-- has your bank account number, and that is all they need to write a check to themselves to withdraw the money from your account and put it in their account, an account that is likely to be so remotely located no one can enforce the State laws. In other words--let me say this again--the payday lender, once they have your checking account number, can reach into your account without your permission and take your money out; thereby, having the ability to bypass the State laws. An Oregon law may say if you have interest rates over those established by Oregon law your loan is uncollectible; that it is illegal [[Page S1812]] in our State. Well, these online predatory payday lenders do not care that it is illegal in Oregon. They have your account number, and they are going to reach in and take your money illegally. That is not the only predatory practice that is evolving. These payday loan companies have also established a practice whereby instead of putting money into your bank account, they give you a prepaid card. This prepaid card looks very convenient. You use it like a credit card, a debit card, and we are familiar with that in America, but here is the ringer. They put fees on these cards that add to the 300-percent, 400- percent, or 500-percent interest rate that is already destroying families, particularly over balance fees. You may not know whether your card has $20 or $30 or $50 left on it. Some of these prepaid cards, in other parts of the financial industry, charge for all kinds of things. They charge you to call and ask what your balance is. They charge if you call and ask a question about how the card works or even what the fees are. They charge a fee just for asking what the fees are. Some of them charge a fee every time you use the card. Some might charge an additional monthly fee, but particularly these prepaid payday loan cards are notorious for their overbalance fees. Let us assume you have perhaps $50 left in your account, you buy something for $52, and maybe immediately you get charged a $35 fee, which they can reach into your account and take, but then that is an overdraft fee on the bank, so the bank is now charging you a fee. Then, because you don't know it is an overdraft because they didn't turn down the transaction, you buy a pack of gum for 50 cents, and there is another $35 fee. You buy a hamburger at Burger King for lunch, and there is another fee. So you can see how these predatory fees line up very quickly on top of the 300-percent, 400-percent, or 500-percent interest rates. So here is the thing. State after State has said these are destroying families and we are going to act. In fact, in the U.S. Senate years ago we acted to protect military families from these predatory loans. The admirals and generals came to Capitol Hill to testify. They said: At our military bases these predatory payday loans are destroying our military families, and it is not just their finances. When their finances are destroyed, relationships are frayed, children's opportunities are damaged. We cannot have this type of terrible impact on our military families. So we established a national cap of interest on these short-term loans. It is good we did. It is good we protected our military families from these abusive, destructive practices, but if these practices are so damaging to families in the military, aren't they equally damaging to families who are not in the military? Shouldn't we apply the same protection to every American family we apply to a military family? Don't we value the success of every American family more than we value protection for legalized loan sharking? Certainly we should, in this Chamber, extend to all families in America the same protection we gave to military families. Until we do that, we should at least make sure the Federal framework requires honoring the tough laws passed by State after State after State to stop these practices. I think the total is about 19 States at this point. That is why I introduced the SAFE Lending Act today. The SAFE Lending Act--stop the abuse and fraud in electronic lending. This act does a couple of key things. First of all, it says these remotely created checks in which a company reaches in and takes your money without your permission--those are banned. You regain control of your checking account. Second, the legislation bans the overdraft fees on these prepaid payday loan cards and other predatory fees established through the Commission. Third, it says that all small-dollar lenders have to register in order to be monitored by their States so they are not in an unregulated world out there without people even knowing they exist. Furthermore, it says that every lender of every type has to abide by the State laws. It doesn't matter whom they are regulated by. Finally, it bans lead generators. Now, what is a lead generator? A lead generator is a fake Web site that pretends it is a payday loan company, offers you a product, and their whole goal is to get your bank account number. Again, once they have that bank account number, they can reach in and take funds out of your account. It is incredible that this is true; that you don't have to sign the check. They basically just use your number and ask to take away the money from John Consumer or Jane Consumer and give it to us, and the bank complies and does it. As amazing as that sounds, that is the way the banking system works. That is what these remotely created checks do. So we to make sure that regardless of what your financial regulator is, you have to abide by the State rules, and we ban these lead generators that are fishing for these bank account numbers. Once they have them, they sell them to the lending industry, to the payday loan industry, and who knows what other hands these numbers end up in. I was surprised a couple of years ago when I noticed a charge on my bank account that wasn't something that either my wife Mary or I had purchased from a store we don't go to. I looked at it carefully and discovered the number of the check was out of the order of my checkbook. So I pulled up the copy of the check on the computer, looking through my account on the computer, and I could see the number matched my account, but the name on the check didn't match my account, the address didn't match my account, and the signature didn't match my signature. None of it matched. The only thing on this check was the number of the bank account that matched my bank account, and that is all that is required for someone to reach in and take money out of your account. That type of fraud is surprising as well, but it reinforces the point that once an online electronic payday loan company has your number, they can reach in. That is all they need to take the money out of your account. So we are going to ban these lead generators as another piece of this predatory profile of the electronic payday loan industry. It is why I am introducing the act. I greatly appreciate my cosponsors on this act, and I would like to thank them all. They are Senator Tom Udall, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Dick Blumenthal, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Senator Ed Markey, Senator Ron Wyden, and Senator Cory Booker. Thank you to all of my colleagues who care a lot about ending predatory financial transactions that strip billions of dollars out of hard-working Americans' accounts. We have a lot of work to do on this. We have accomplished some. There is much more to be done. Certainly, when James Truslow Adams said that individuals of each generation will have to stand and fight against practices designed to destroy the American dream, he was talking about things such as this--practices that proceed to undermine the success of America's working families. Let us stop those predatory practices in their tracks and pass the SAFE Lending Act. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1811-S1812] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. Udall, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Warren, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Heinrich): S. 2760. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to address certain issues related to the extension of consumer credit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, an American historian, James Truslow Adams, wrote a book in 1931 entitled ``The Epic of America,'' and in this book he coined the term the ``American dream.'' He went on to say this: ``Ever since we have become an independent nation, each generation has seen an uprising of the ordinary Americans to save that dream from the forces which appeared to be overwhelming and dispelling it.'' One of those forces that has been overwhelming the effort of middle- class, hard-working Americans to be successful is predatory lending. Today I am specifically rising to discuss the introduction of the SAFE Lending Act. SAFE stands for stopping abuse and fraud in electronic lending. The focus of this is short-term, high-interest loans, often referred to as ``payday'' loans. These loans often have interest rates of 300 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent. The debt a family has with one of those loans just grows and grows and grows. Consider this: If you take out $1,000 today, a year from now, at 500 percent interest, you owe $5,000. In 2 years you owe $25,000--an impossible sum for a family of modest means. So these payday loans pull families into a vortex of debt from which they cannot escape, and this vortex destroys them financially. These are huge consequences for the parents, certainly, but huge consequences for the children. It does a tremendous amount of damage to American families. This is why many major religions in the world have come out over time--over thousands a year--and said high- interest lending destroys and shouldn't be done, but here we have it, right here in America. Many States, including my State of Oregon, have worked to end this vortex of debt. They have put a cap on the interest rate. They have stopped the every-2-week rollovers, and so they have returned, if you will, small-dollar lending to being an affordable instrument that doesn't destroy families. These tough State laws are under assault by new tactics of the payday loan industry, and we need to address those new tactics. Specifically, the industry is starting to use an instrument called remotely created checks. How does this work? Let's say you have your bank account and you take out a payday loan. The dollars are put into your bank account, and you think they are going to stay there, but now this online payday loan company--and who knows where in the world these people really are; they may be overseas in any remote location, extremely difficult to find, extremely difficult to enforce our laws-- has your bank account number, and that is all they need to write a check to themselves to withdraw the money from your account and put it in their account, an account that is likely to be so remotely located no one can enforce the State laws. In other words--let me say this again--the payday lender, once they have your checking account number, can reach into your account without your permission and take your money out; thereby, having the ability to bypass the State laws. An Oregon law may say if you have interest rates over those established by Oregon law your loan is uncollectible; that it is illegal [[Page S1812]] in our State. Well, these online predatory payday lenders do not care that it is illegal in Oregon. They have your account number, and they are going to reach in and take your money illegally. That is not the only predatory practice that is evolving. These payday loan companies have also established a practice whereby instead of putting money into your bank account, they give you a prepaid card. This prepaid card looks very convenient. You use it like a credit card, a debit card, and we are familiar with that in America, but here is the ringer. They put fees on these cards that add to the 300-percent, 400- percent, or 500-percent interest rate that is already destroying families, particularly over balance fees. You may not know whether your card has $20 or $30 or $50 left on it. Some of these prepaid cards, in other parts of the financial industry, charge for all kinds of things. They charge you to call and ask what your balance is. They charge if you call and ask a question about how the card works or even what the fees are. They charge a fee just for asking what the fees are. Some of them charge a fee every time you use the card. Some might charge an additional monthly fee, but particularly these prepaid payday loan cards are notorious for their overbalance fees. Let us assume you have perhaps $50 left in your account, you buy something for $52, and maybe immediately you get charged a $35 fee, which they can reach into your account and take, but then that is an overdraft fee on the bank, so the bank is now charging you a fee. Then, because you don't know it is an overdraft because they didn't turn down the transaction, you buy a pack of gum for 50 cents, and there is another $35 fee. You buy a hamburger at Burger King for lunch, and there is another fee. So you can see how these predatory fees line up very quickly on top of the 300-percent, 400-percent, or 500-percent interest rates. So here is the thing. State after State has said these are destroying families and we are going to act. In fact, in the U.S. Senate years ago we acted to protect military families from these predatory loans. The admirals and generals came to Capitol Hill to testify. They said: At our military bases these predatory payday loans are destroying our military families, and it is not just their finances. When their finances are destroyed, relationships are frayed, children's opportunities are damaged. We cannot have this type of terrible impact on our military families. So we established a national cap of interest on these short-term loans. It is good we did. It is good we protected our military families from these abusive, destructive practices, but if these practices are so damaging to families in the military, aren't they equally damaging to families who are not in the military? Shouldn't we apply the same protection to every American family we apply to a military family? Don't we value the success of every American family more than we value protection for legalized loan sharking? Certainly we should, in this Chamber, extend to all families in America the same protection we gave to military families. Until we do that, we should at least make sure the Federal framework requires honoring the tough laws passed by State after State after State to stop these practices. I think the total is about 19 States at this point. That is why I introduced the SAFE Lending Act today. The SAFE Lending Act--stop the abuse and fraud in electronic lending. This act does a couple of key things. First of all, it says these remotely created checks in which a company reaches in and takes your money without your permission--those are banned. You regain control of your checking account. Second, the legislation bans the overdraft fees on these prepaid payday loan cards and other predatory fees established through the Commission. Third, it says that all small-dollar lenders have to register in order to be monitored by their States so they are not in an unregulated world out there without people even knowing they exist. Furthermore, it says that every lender of every type has to abide by the State laws. It doesn't matter whom they are regulated by. Finally, it bans lead generators. Now, what is a lead generator? A lead generator is a fake Web site that pretends it is a payday loan company, offers you a product, and their whole goal is to get your bank account number. Again, once they have that bank account number, they can reach in and take funds out of your account. It is incredible that this is true; that you don't have to sign the check. They basically just use your number and ask to take away the money from John Consumer or Jane Consumer and give it to us, and the bank complies and does it. As amazing as that sounds, that is the way the banking system works. That is what these remotely created checks do. So we to make sure that regardless of what your financial regulator is, you have to abide by the State rules, and we ban these lead generators that are fishing for these bank account numbers. Once they have them, they sell them to the lending industry, to the payday loan industry, and who knows what other hands these numbers end up in.

CREC-2016-04-07-pt1-PgS1812,CREC-2016-04-07,114,Introductory Statement on S. 2763,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1812-S1813] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Blumenthal): S. 2763. A bill to provide the victims of Holocaust-era persecution and their heirs a fair opportunity to recover works of art confiscated or misappropriated by the Nazis; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2763 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) It is estimated that the Nazis confiscated or otherwise misappropriated as many as 650,000 works of art throughout Europe as part of their genocidal campaign against the Jewish people and other persecuted groups. This has been described as the ``greatest displacement of art in human history''. (2) Following World War II, the United States and its allies attempted to return the stolen artworks to their countries of origin. Despite these efforts, many works of art [[Page S1813]] were never reunited with their owners. Some of the art has since been discovered in the United States. (3) In 1998, the United States convened a conference with 44 nations in Washington, D.C., known as the Washington Conference, which produced Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. One of these principles is that ``steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution'' to claims involving such art that has not been restituted if the owners or their heirs can be identified. (4) The same year, Congress enacted the Holocaust Victims Redress Act (Public Law 105-158, 112 Stat. 15), which expressed the sense of Congress that ``all governments should undertake good faith efforts to facilitate the return of private and public property, such as works of art, to the rightful owners in cases where assets were confiscated from the claimant during the period of Nazi rule and there is reasonable proof that the claimant is the rightful owner.''. (5) In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, with 45 other nations. At the conclusion of this conference, the participating nations issued the Terezin Declaration, which reaffirmed the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi- Confiscated Art and urged all participants ``to ensure that their legal systems or alternative processes, while taking into account the different legal traditions, facilitate just and fair solutions with regard to Nazi-confiscated and looted art, and to make certain that claims to recover such art are resolved expeditiously and based on the facts and merits of the claims and all the relevant documents submitted by all parties.''. The Declaration also urged participants to ``consider all relevant issues when applying various legal provisions that may impede the restitution of art and cultural property, in order to achieve just and fair solutions, as well as alternative dispute resolution, where appropriate under law.''. (6) Numerous victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs have taken legal action to recover Nazi-confiscated art. These lawsuits face significant procedural obstacles partly due to State statutes of limitations, which typically bar claims within some limited number of years from either the date of the loss or the date that the claim should have been discovered. In some cases, this means that the claims expired before World War II even ended. (See, e.g., The Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin, No. 06-10333, 2007 WL 1016996 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2007)). The unique and horrific circumstances of World War II and the Holocaust make statutes of limitations and other time-based procedural defenses especially burdensome to the victims and their heirs. Those seeking recovery of Nazi-confiscated art must painstakingly piece together their cases from a fragmentary historical record ravaged by persecution, war, and genocide. This costly process often cannot be done within the time constraints imposed by existing law. (7) Federal legislation is needed because the only court that has considered the question held that the Constitution prohibits States from making exceptions to their statutes of limitations to accommodate claims involving the recovery of Nazi-confiscated art. In Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art, 592 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California law that extended the State statute of limitations for claims seeking recovery of Holocaust-era artwork. The Court held that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the Federal Government's exclusive authority over foreign affairs, which includes the resolution of war-related disputes. In light of this precedent, the enactment of a Federal law is the best way to ensure that claims to Nazi- confiscated art are adjudicated on their merits. SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To ensure that laws governing claims to Nazi- confiscated art further United States policy as set forth in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration. (2) To ensure that claims to artwork stolen or misappropriated by the Nazis are not barred by statutes of limitations and other similar legal doctrines but are resolved in a just and fair manner on the merits. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act-- (1) the term ``actual discovery'' does not include any constructive knowledge imputed by law; (2) the term ``artwork or other cultural property'' includes any painting, sculpture, drawing, work of graphic art, print, multiples, book, manuscript, archive, or sacred or ceremonial object; (3) the term ``persecution during the Nazi era'' means any persecution by the Nazis or their allies during the period from January 1, 1933, to December 31, 1945, that was based on race, ethnicity, or religion; and (4) the term ``unlawfully lost'' includes any theft, seizure, forced sale, sale under duress, or any other loss of an artwork or cultural property that would not have occurred absent persecution during the Nazi era. SEC. 5. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, any provision of State law, or any defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches), a civil claim or cause of action against a defendant to recover any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era or for damages for the taking or detaining of any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era may be commenced not later than 6 years after the actual discovery by the claimant or the agent of the claimant of-- (1) the identity and location of the artwork or cultural property; and (2) information or facts sufficient to indicate that the claimant has a claim for a possessory interest in the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost. (b) Possible Misidentification.--For purposes of subsection (a)(1), in a case in which there is a possibility of misidentification of the artwork or cultural property, the identification of the artwork or cultural property shall occur on the date on which there are facts sufficient to determine that the artwork or cultural property is likely to be the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost. (c) Applicability.-- (1) In general.--Subsection (a) shall apply to any civil claim or cause of action (including a civil claim or cause of action described in paragraph (2)) that is-- (A) pending on the date of enactment of this Act; or (B) filed during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2026. (2) Inclusion of previously dismissed claims.--A civil claim or cause of action described in this paragraph is a civil claim or cause of action-- (A) that was dismissed before the date of enactment of this Act based on the expiration of a Federal or State statute of limitations or any other defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches); and (B) in which final judgment has not been entered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 53 (Thursday, April 7, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1812-S1813] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Blumenthal): S. 2763.

(5) In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, with 45 other nations. At the conclusion of this conference, the participating nations issued the Terezin Declaration, which reaffirmed the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi- Confiscated Art and urged all participants ``to ensure that their legal systems or alternative processes, while taking into account the different legal traditions, facilitate just and fair solutions with regard to Nazi-confiscated and looted art, and to make certain that claims to recover such art are resolved expeditiously and based on the facts and merits of the claims and all the relevant documents submitted by all parties.''. The Declaration also urged participants to ``consider all relevant issues when applying various legal provisions that may impede the restitution of art and cultural property, in order to achieve just and fair solutions, as well as alternative dispute resolution, where appropriate under law.''. (6) Numerous victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs have taken legal action to recover Nazi-confiscated art. These lawsuits face significant procedural obstacles partly due to State statutes of limitations, which typically bar claims within some limited number of years from either the date of the loss or the date that the claim should have been discovered. In some cases, this means that the claims expired before World War II even ended. (See, e.g., The Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin, No. 06-10333, 2007 WL 1016996 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2007)). The unique and horrific circumstances of World War II and the Holocaust make statutes of limitations and other time-based procedural defenses especially burdensome to the victims and their heirs. Those seeking recovery of Nazi-confiscated art must painstakingly piece together their cases from a fragmentary historical record ravaged by persecution, war, and genocide. This costly process often cannot be done within the time constraints imposed by existing law. (7) Federal legislation is needed because the only court that has considered the question held that the Constitution prohibits States from making exceptions to their statutes of limitations to accommodate claims involving the recovery of Nazi-confiscated art. In Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art, 592 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California law that extended the State statute of limitations for claims seeking recovery of Holocaust-era artwork. The Court held that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the Federal Government's exclusive authority over foreign affairs, which includes the resolution of war-related disputes. In light of this precedent, the enactment of a Federal law is the best way to ensure that claims to Nazi- confiscated art are adjudicated on their merits. SEC. 3. PURPOSES. The purposes of this Act are the following: (1) To ensure that laws governing claims to Nazi- confiscated art further United States policy as set forth in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration. (2) To ensure that claims to artwork stolen or misappropriated by the Nazis are not barred by statutes of limitations and other similar legal doctrines but are resolved in a just and fair manner on the merits. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act-- (1) the term ``actual discovery'' does not include any constructive knowledge imputed by law; (2) the term ``artwork or other cultural property'' includes any painting, sculpture, drawing, work of graphic art, print, multiples, book, manuscript, archive, or sacred or ceremonial object; (3) the term ``persecution during the Nazi era'' means any persecution by the Nazis or their allies during the period from January 1, 1933, to December 31, 1945, that was based on race, ethnicity, or religion; and (4) the term ``unlawfully lost'' includes any theft, seizure, forced sale, sale under duress, or any other loss of an artwork or cultural property that would not have occurred absent persecution during the Nazi era. SEC. 5. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, any provision of State law, or any defense at law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches), a civil claim or cause of action against a defendant to recover any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era or for damages for the taking or detaining of any artwork or other cultural property unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era may be commenced not later than 6 years after the actual discovery by the claimant or the agent of the claimant of-- (1) the identity and location of the artwork or cultural property; and (2) information or facts sufficient to indicate that the claimant has a claim for a possessory interest in the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost.

(2) following world war ii, the united states and its allies attempted to return the stolen artworks to their countries of origin. despite these efforts, many works of art [[page s1813]] were never reunited with their owners. some of the art has since been discovered in the united states. (3) in 1998, the united states convened a conference with 44 nations in washington, d.c., known as the washington conference, which produced principles on nazi-confiscated art. one of these principles is that ``steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution'' to claims involving such art that has not been restituted if the owners or their heirs can be identified.

IMPROVING AIRLINE COMPETITIVENESS. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The people of the United States and the United States economy depend on a strong and competitive passenger air transportation industry to move people and goods in the fastest, most efficient manner. (2) In a global economy, air carriers connect the people of the United States with the rest of the world. A strong air transportation industry is essential to the ability of the United States to compete in the international marketplace. (3) A strong air transportation industry depends on competition between a number of air carriers servicing a variety of routes for domestic and international travelers, at both the national and local levels. (4) Important stakeholders contribute to, and are dependent on, a robust air transportation industry, including-- (A) business and leisure travelers; (B) the tourism sector; (C) shippers; (D) State and local governments and port authorities; (E) aircraft manufacturers; and (F) domestic and foreign air carriers. (5) As a result of the consolidation of United States air carriers, there has been a precipitous decline in the number of major passenger air carriers in the United States. (6) In the past few years, the air transportation industry has become increasingly concentrated. In 2015, the top 4 major air carriers accounted for 80 percent of passenger air traffic in the United States. (7) The continued success of a deregulated air carrier system requires actual competition to encourage all participants in the industry to provide high quality service at competitive fares. (8) Further consolidation among air carriers threatens to leave the industry without sufficient competition to ensure that the people of the United States share in the benefits of a well-functioning air transportation industry. (b) Establishment of National Commission to Ensure All Americans Have Access to and Benefit From a Strong and Competitive Air Transportation Industry.--There is established a Commission, which shall be known as the ``National Commission to Ensure All Americans Have Access to and Benefit from a Strong and Competitive Air Transportation Industry'' (referred to in this section as the ``Commission''). (c) Functions.-- (1) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study of the passenger air transportation industry, with priority given to issues specified in subsection (d). (2) Policy recommendations.--Based on the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1), the Commission shall recommend to the President and to Congress the adoption of policies that will-- (A) achieve the national goal of a strong and competitive air carrier system and facilitate the ability of the United States to compete in the global economy; (B) provide robust levels of competition and air transportation at reasonable fares in cities of all sizes; (C) provide a stable work environment for employees of air carriers; (D) account for the interests of different stakeholders that contribute to, and are dependent on, the air transportation industry; and (E) provide appropriate levels of protection for consumers, including access to information to enable consumer choice. (d) Specific Issues to Be Addressed.--In conducting the study under subsection (c)(1), the Commission shall investigate-- (1) the current state of competition in the air transportation industry, how the structure of that competition is likely to change during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, whether that expected level of competition will be sufficient to secure the consumer benefits of air carrier deregulation, and the effects of-- [[Page S1829]] (A) air carrier consolidation and practices on consumers, including the competitiveness of fares and services and the ability of consumers to engage in comparison shopping for air carrier fees; (B) airfare pricing policies, including whether reduced competition artificially inflates ticket prices; (C) the level of competition as of the date of the enactment of this Act on the travel distribution sector, including online and traditional travel agencies and intermediaries; (D) economic and other effects on domestic air transportation markets in which 1 or 2 air carriers control the majority of available seat miles; (E) the tactics used by incumbent air carriers to compete against smaller, regional carriers, or inhibit new or potential new entrant air carriers into a particular market; and (F) the ability of new entrant air carriers to provide new service to underserved markets; (2) the legislative and administrative actions that the Federal Government should take to enhance air carrier competition, including changes that are needed in the legal and administrative policies that govern-- (A) the initial award and the transfer of international routes; (B) the allocation of gates and landing rights, particularly at airports dominated by 1 air carrier or a limited number of air carriers; (C) frequent flier programs; (D) the rights of foreign investors to invest in the domestic air transportation marketplace; (E) the access of foreign air carriers to the domestic air transportation marketplace; (F) the taxes and user fees imposed on air carriers; (G) the responsibilities imposed on air carriers; (H) the bankruptcy laws of the United States and related rules administered by the Department of Transportation as such laws and rules apply to air carriers; (I) the obligations of failing air carriers to meet pension obligations; (J) antitrust immunity for international air carrier alliances and the process for approving such alliances and awarding that immunity; (K) competition of air carrier codeshare partnerships and joint ventures; and (L) constraints on new entry into the domestic air transportation marketplace; (3) whether the policies and strategies of the United States in international air transportation are promoting the ability of United States air carriers to achieve long-term competitive success in international air transportation markets, and to secure the benefits of robust competition, including-- (A) the general negotiating policy of the United States with respect to international air transportation; (B) the desirability of multilateral rather than bilateral negotiations with respect to international air transportation; (C) whether foreign countries have developed the necessary infrastructure of airports and airways to enable United States air carriers to provide the service needed to meet the demand for air transportation between the United States and those countries; (D) the desirability of liberalization of United States domestic air transportation markets; and (E) the impediments to access by foreign air carriers to routes to and from the United States; (4) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on business and leisure travelers, and travel and tourism more broadly; and (5) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on-- (A) employment and economic development opportunities of localities, particularly small and mid-size localities; and (B) former hub airports, including the positive and negative consequences of routing air traffic through hub airports.

SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Vessel Incidental Discharge Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Since the enactment of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (22 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980, the United States Coast Guard has been the principal Federal authority charged with administering, enforcing, and prescribing regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime commerce and transportation. (2) The Coast Guard estimates there are approximately 21,560,000 State-registered recreational vessels, 75,000 commercial fishing vessels, and 33,000 freight and tank barges operating in United States waters. (3) From 1973 to 2005, certain discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel were exempted by regulation from otherwise applicable permitting requirements. (4) During the 32 years during which this regulatory exemption was in effect, Congress enacted several statutes to deal with the regulation of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, including-- (A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980; (B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.); (C) the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 4073); (D) section 415 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 3434) and section 623 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (33 U.S.C. 1901 note), which established interim and permanent requirements, respectively, for the regulation of vessel discharges of certain bulk cargo residue; (E) title XIV of division B of Appendix D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763), which prohibited or limited certain vessel discharges in certain areas of Alaska; (F) section 204 of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (33 U.S.C. 1902a), which established requirements for the regulation of vessel discharges of agricultural cargo residue material in the form of hold washings; and (G) title X of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 (33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), which provided for the implementation of the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001. (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for the establishment of nationally uniform and environmentally sound standards and requirements for the management of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel.

IMPROVING AIRLINE COMPETITIVENESS. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The people of the United States and the United States economy depend on a strong and competitive passenger air transportation industry to move people and goods in the fastest, most efficient manner. (2) In a global economy, air carriers connect the people of the United States with the rest of the world. A strong air transportation industry is essential to the ability of the United States to compete in the international marketplace. (3) A strong air transportation industry depends on competition between a number of air carriers servicing a variety of routes for domestic and international travelers, at both the national and local levels. (4) Important stakeholders contribute to, and are dependent on, a robust air transportation industry, including-- (A) business and leisure travelers; (B) the tourism sector; (C) shippers; (D) State and local governments and port authorities; (E) aircraft manufacturers; and (F) domestic and foreign air carriers. (5) As a result of the consolidation of United States air carriers, there has been a precipitous decline in the number of major passenger air carriers in the United States. (6) In the past few years, the air transportation industry has become increasingly concentrated. In 2015, the top 4 major air carriers accounted for 80 percent of passenger air traffic in the United States. (7) The continued success of a deregulated air carrier system requires actual competition to encourage all participants in the industry to provide high quality service at competitive fares. (8) Further consolidation among air carriers threatens to leave the industry without sufficient competition to ensure that the people of the United States share in the benefits of a well-functioning air transportation industry. (b) Establishment of National Commission to Ensure All Americans Have Access to and Benefit From a Strong and Competitive Air Transportation Industry.--There is established a Commission, which shall be known as the ``National Commission to Ensure All Americans Have Access to and Benefit from a Strong and Competitive Air Transportation Industry'' (referred to in this section as the ``Commission''). (c) Functions.-- (1) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study of the passenger air transportation industry, with priority given to issues specified in subsection (d). (2) Policy recommendations.--Based on the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1), the Commission shall recommend to the President and to Congress the adoption of policies that will-- (A) achieve the national goal of a strong and competitive air carrier system and facilitate the ability of the United States to compete in the global economy; (B) provide robust levels of competition and air transportation at reasonable fares in cities of all sizes; (C) provide a stable work environment for employees of air carriers; (D) account for the interests of different stakeholders that contribute to, and are dependent on, the air transportation industry; and (E) provide appropriate levels of protection for consumers, including access to information to enable consumer choice. (d) Specific Issues to Be Addressed.--In conducting the study under subsection (c)(1), the Commission shall investigate-- (1) the current state of competition in the air transportation industry, how the structure of that competition is likely to change during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, whether that expected level of competition will be sufficient to secure the consumer benefits of air carrier deregulation, and the effects of-- [[Page S1829]] (A) air carrier consolidation and practices on consumers, including the competitiveness of fares and services and the ability of consumers to engage in comparison shopping for air carrier fees; (B) airfare pricing policies, including whether reduced competition artificially inflates ticket prices; (C) the level of competition as of the date of the enactment of this Act on the travel distribution sector, including online and traditional travel agencies and intermediaries; (D) economic and other effects on domestic air transportation markets in which 1 or 2 air carriers control the majority of available seat miles; (E) the tactics used by incumbent air carriers to compete against smaller, regional carriers, or inhibit new or potential new entrant air carriers into a particular market; and (F) the ability of new entrant air carriers to provide new service to underserved markets; (2) the legislative and administrative actions that the Federal Government should take to enhance air carrier competition, including changes that are needed in the legal and administrative policies that govern-- (A) the initial award and the transfer of international routes; (B) the allocation of gates and landing rights, particularly at airports dominated by 1 air carrier or a limited number of air carriers; (C) frequent flier programs; (D) the rights of foreign investors to invest in the domestic air transportation marketplace; (E) the access of foreign air carriers to the domestic air transportation marketplace; (F) the taxes and user fees imposed on air carriers; (G) the responsibilities imposed on air carriers; (H) the bankruptcy laws of the United States and related rules administered by the Department of Transportation as such laws and rules apply to air carriers; (I) the obligations of failing air carriers to meet pension obligations; (J) antitrust immunity for international air carrier alliances and the process for approving such alliances and awarding that immunity; (K) competition of air carrier codeshare partnerships and joint ventures; and (L) constraints on new entry into the domestic air transportation marketplace; (3) whether the policies and strategies of the United States in international air transportation are promoting the ability of United States air carriers to achieve long-term competitive success in international air transportation markets, and to secure the benefits of robust competition, including-- (A) the general negotiating policy of the United States with respect to international air transportation; (B) the desirability of multilateral rather than bilateral negotiations with respect to international air transportation; (C) whether foreign countries have developed the necessary infrastructure of airports and airways to enable United States air carriers to provide the service needed to meet the demand for air transportation between the United States and those countries; (D) the desirability of liberalization of United States domestic air transportation markets; and (E) the impediments to access by foreign air carriers to routes to and from the United States; (4) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on business and leisure travelers, and travel and tourism more broadly; and (5) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on-- (A) employment and economic development opportunities of localities, particularly small and mid-size localities; and (B) former hub airports, including the positive and negative consequences of routing air traffic through hub airports.

IMPROVING AIRLINE COMPETITIVENESS. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The people of the United States and the United States economy depend on a strong and competitive passenger air transportation industry to move people and goods in the fastest, most efficient manner. (2) In a global economy, air carriers connect the people of the United States with the rest of the world. A strong air transportation industry is essential to the ability of the United States to compete in the international marketplace. (3) A strong air transportation industry depends on competition between a number of air carriers servicing a variety of routes for domestic and international travelers, at both the national and local levels. (4) Important stakeholders contribute to, and are dependent on, a robust air transportation industry, including-- (A) business and leisure travelers; (B) the tourism sector; (C) shippers; (D) State and local governments and port authorities; (E) aircraft manufacturers; and (F) domestic and foreign air carriers. (5) As a result of the consolidation of United States air carriers, there has been a precipitous decline in the number of major passenger air carriers in the United States. (6) In the past few years, the air transportation industry has become increasingly concentrated. In 2015, the top 4 major air carriers accounted for 80 percent of passenger air traffic in the United States. (7) The continued success of a deregulated air carrier system requires actual competition to encourage all participants in the industry to provide high quality service at competitive fares. (8) Further consolidation among air carriers threatens to leave the industry without sufficient competition to ensure that the people of the United States share in the benefits of a well-functioning air transportation industry.

(a) findings.--congress makes the following findings: (1) the people of the united states and the united states economy depend on a strong and competitive passenger air transportation industry to move people and goods in the fastest, most efficient manner. (2) in a global economy, air carriers connect the people of the united states with the rest of the world. a strong air transportation industry is essential to the ability of the united states to compete in the international marketplace. (3) a strong air transportation industry depends on competition between a number of air carriers servicing a variety of routes for domestic and international travelers, at both the national and local levels. (4) important stakeholders contribute to, and are dependent on, a robust air transportation industry, including-- (a) business and leisure travelers; (b) the tourism sector; (c) shippers; (d) state and local governments and port authorities; (e) aircraft manufacturers; and (f) domestic and foreign air carriers. (5) as a result of the consolidation of united states air carriers, there has been a precipitous decline in the number of major passenger air carriers in the united states. (6) in the past few years, the air transportation industry has become increasingly concentrated. in 2015, the top 4 major air carriers accounted for 80 percent of passenger air traffic in the united states. (7) the continued success of a deregulated air carrier system requires actual competition to encourage all participants in the industry to provide high quality service at competitive fares. (8) further consolidation among air carriers threatens to leave the industry without sufficient competition to ensure that the people of the united states share in the benefits of a well-functioning air transportation industry. (b) establishment of national commission to ensure all americans have access to and benefit from a strong and competitive air transportation industry.--there is established a commission, which shall be known as the ``national commission to ensure all americans have access to and benefit from a strong and competitive air transportation industry'' (referred to in this section as the ``commission'').

(d) specific issues to be addressed.--in conducting the study under subsection (c)(1), the commission shall investigate-- (1) the current state of competition in the air transportation industry, how the structure of that competition is likely to change during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, whether that expected level of competition will be sufficient to secure the consumer benefits of air carrier deregulation, and the effects of-- [[page s1829]] (a) air carrier consolidation and practices on consumers, including the competitiveness of fares and services and the ability of consumers to engage in comparison shopping for air carrier fees; (b) airfare pricing policies, including whether reduced competition artificially inflates ticket prices; (c) the level of competition as of the date of the enactment of this act on the travel distribution sector, including online and traditional travel agencies and intermediaries; (d) economic and other effects on domestic air transportation markets in which 1 or 2 air carriers control the majority of available seat miles; (e) the tactics used by incumbent air carriers to compete against smaller, regional carriers, or inhibit new or potential new entrant air carriers into a particular market; and (f) the ability of new entrant air carriers to provide new service to underserved markets; (2) the legislative and administrative actions that the federal government should take to enhance air carrier competition, including changes that are needed in the legal and administrative policies that govern-- (a) the initial award and the transfer of international routes; (b) the allocation of gates and landing rights, particularly at airports dominated by 1 air carrier or a limited number of air carriers; (c) frequent flier programs; (d) the rights of foreign investors to invest in the domestic air transportation marketplace; (e) the access of foreign air carriers to the domestic air transportation marketplace; (f) the taxes and user fees imposed on air carriers; (g) the responsibilities imposed on air carriers; (h) the bankruptcy laws of the united states and related rules administered by the department of transportation as such laws and rules apply to air carriers; (i) the obligations of failing air carriers to meet pension obligations; (j) antitrust immunity for international air carrier alliances and the process for approving such alliances and awarding that immunity; (k) competition of air carrier codeshare partnerships and joint ventures; and (l) constraints on new entry into the domestic air transportation marketplace; (3) whether the policies and strategies of the united states in international air transportation are promoting the ability of united states air carriers to achieve long-term competitive success in international air transportation markets, and to secure the benefits of robust competition, including-- (a) the general negotiating policy of the united states with respect to international air transportation; (b) the desirability of multilateral rather than bilateral negotiations with respect to international air transportation; (c) whether foreign countries have developed the necessary infrastructure of airports and airways to enable united states air carriers to provide the service needed to meet the demand for air transportation between the united states and those countries; (d) the desirability of liberalization of united states domestic air transportation markets; and (e) the impediments to access by foreign air carriers to routes to and from the united states; (4) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on business and leisure travelers, and travel and tourism more broadly; and (5) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on-- (a) employment and economic development opportunities of localities, particularly small and mid-size localities; and (b) former hub airports, including the positive and negative consequences of routing air traffic through hub airports.

SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Vessel Incidental Discharge Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Since the enactment of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (22 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980, the United States Coast Guard has been the principal Federal authority charged with administering, enforcing, and prescribing regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime commerce and transportation. (2) The Coast Guard estimates there are approximately 21,560,000 State-registered recreational vessels, 75,000 commercial fishing vessels, and 33,000 freight and tank barges operating in United States waters. (3) From 1973 to 2005, certain discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel were exempted by regulation from otherwise applicable permitting requirements. (4) During the 32 years during which this regulatory exemption was in effect, Congress enacted several statutes to deal with the regulation of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, including-- (A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980; (B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.); (C) the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 4073); (D) section 415 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 3434) and section 623 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (33 U.S.C. 1901 note), which established interim and permanent requirements, respectively, for the regulation of vessel discharges of certain bulk cargo residue; (E) title XIV of division B of Appendix D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763), which prohibited or limited certain vessel discharges in certain areas of Alaska; (F) section 204 of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (33 U.S.C. 1902a), which established requirements for the regulation of vessel discharges of agricultural cargo residue material in the form of hold washings; and (G) title X of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 (33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), which provided for the implementation of the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001.

Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. Blunt, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Graham, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Risch, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Sullivan, and Mr. Vitter) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 3464 submitted by Mr. Thune (for himself and Mr. Nelson) to the bill H.R. 636, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--VESSEL INCIDENTAL DISCHARGE ACT SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Vessel Incidental Discharge Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Since the enactment of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (22 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980, the United States Coast Guard has been the principal Federal authority charged with administering, enforcing, and prescribing regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime commerce and transportation. (2) The Coast Guard estimates there are approximately 21,560,000 State-registered recreational vessels, 75,000 commercial fishing vessels, and 33,000 freight and tank barges operating in United States waters. (3) From 1973 to 2005, certain discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel were exempted by regulation from otherwise applicable permitting requirements. (4) During the 32 years during which this regulatory exemption was in effect, Congress enacted several statutes to deal with the regulation of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, including-- (A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980; (B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.); (C) the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 4073); (D) section 415 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 3434) and section 623 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (33 U.S.C. 1901 note), which established interim and permanent requirements, respectively, for the regulation of vessel discharges of certain bulk cargo residue; (E) title XIV of division B of Appendix D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763), which prohibited or limited certain vessel discharges in certain areas of Alaska; (F) section 204 of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (33 U.S.C. 1902a), which established requirements for the regulation of vessel discharges of agricultural cargo residue material in the form of hold washings; and (G) title X of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 (33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), which provided for the implementation of the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001.

Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. Blunt, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Graham, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Risch, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Sullivan, and Mr. Vitter) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 3464 submitted by Mr. Thune (for himself and Mr. Nelson) to the bill H.R. 636, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--VESSEL INCIDENTAL DISCHARGE ACT SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Vessel Incidental Discharge Act''. SEC. _02. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Since the enactment of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (22 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980, the United States Coast Guard has been the principal Federal authority charged with administering, enforcing, and prescribing regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime commerce and transportation. (2) The Coast Guard estimates there are approximately 21,560,000 State-registered recreational vessels, 75,000 commercial fishing vessels, and 33,000 freight and tank barges operating in United States waters. (3) From 1973 to 2005, certain discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel were exempted by regulation from otherwise applicable permitting requirements. (4) During the 32 years during which this regulatory exemption was in effect, Congress enacted several statutes to deal with the regulation of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, including-- (A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980; (B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.); (C) the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 4073); (D) section 415 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 3434) and section 623 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (33 U.S.C. 1901 note), which established interim and permanent requirements, respectively, for the regulation of vessel discharges of certain bulk cargo residue; (E) title XIV of division B of Appendix D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763), which prohibited or limited certain vessel discharges in certain areas of Alaska; (F) section 204 of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (33 U.S.C. 1902a), which established requirements for the regulation of vessel discharges of agricultural cargo residue material in the form of hold washings; and (G) title X of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 (33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), which provided for the implementation of the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001.

IMPROVING AIRLINE COMPETITIVENESS. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The people of the United States and the United States economy depend on a strong and competitive passenger air transportation industry to move people and goods in the fastest, most efficient manner. (2) In a global economy, air carriers connect the people of the United States with the rest of the world. A strong air transportation industry is essential to the ability of the United States to compete in the international marketplace. (3) A strong air transportation industry depends on competition between a number of air carriers servicing a variety of routes for domestic and international travelers, at both the national and local levels. (4) Important stakeholders contribute to, and are dependent on, a robust air transportation industry, including-- (A) business and leisure travelers; (B) the tourism sector; (C) shippers; (D) State and local governments and port authorities; (E) aircraft manufacturers; and (F) domestic and foreign air carriers. (5) As a result of the consolidation of United States air carriers, there has been a precipitous decline in the number of major passenger air carriers in the United States. (6) In the past few years, the air transportation industry has become increasingly concentrated. In 2015, the top 4 major air carriers accounted for 80 percent of passenger air traffic in the United States. (7) The continued success of a deregulated air carrier system requires actual competition to encourage all participants in the industry to provide high quality service at competitive fares. (8) Further consolidation among air carriers threatens to leave the industry without sufficient competition to ensure that the people of the United States share in the benefits of a well-functioning air transportation industry. (b) Establishment of National Commission to Ensure All Americans Have Access to and Benefit From a Strong and Competitive Air Transportation Industry.--There is established a Commission, which shall be known as the ``National Commission to Ensure All Americans Have Access to and Benefit from a Strong and Competitive Air Transportation Industry'' (referred to in this section as the ``Commission''). (c) Functions.-- (1) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study of the passenger air transportation industry, with priority given to issues specified in subsection (d). (2) Policy recommendations.--Based on the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1), the Commission shall recommend to the President and to Congress the adoption of policies that will-- (A) achieve the national goal of a strong and competitive air carrier system and facilitate the ability of the United States to compete in the global economy; (B) provide robust levels of competition and air transportation at reasonable fares in cities of all sizes; (C) provide a stable work environment for employees of air carriers; (D) account for the interests of different stakeholders that contribute to, and are dependent on, the air transportation industry; and (E) provide appropriate levels of protection for consumers, including access to information to enable consumer choice. (d) Specific Issues to Be Addressed.--In conducting the study under subsection (c)(1), the Commission shall investigate-- (1) the current state of competition in the air transportation industry, how the structure of that competition is likely to change during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, whether that expected level of competition will be sufficient to secure the consumer benefits of air carrier deregulation, and the effects of-- [[Page S1829]] (A) air carrier consolidation and practices on consumers, including the competitiveness of fares and services and the ability of consumers to engage in comparison shopping for air carrier fees; (B) airfare pricing policies, including whether reduced competition artificially inflates ticket prices; (C) the level of competition as of the date of the enactment of this Act on the travel distribution sector, including online and traditional travel agencies and intermediaries; (D) economic and other effects on domestic air transportation markets in which 1 or 2 air carriers control the majority of available seat miles; (E) the tactics used by incumbent air carriers to compete against smaller, regional carriers, or inhibit new or potential new entrant air carriers into a particular market; and (F) the ability of new entrant air carriers to provide new service to underserved markets; (2) the legislative and administrative actions that the Federal Government should take to enhance air carrier competition, including changes that are needed in the legal and administrative policies that govern-- (A) the initial award and the transfer of international routes; (B) the allocation of gates and landing rights, particularly at airports dominated by 1 air carrier or a limited number of air carriers; (C) frequent flier programs; (D) the rights of foreign investors to invest in the domestic air transportation marketplace; (E) the access of foreign air carriers to the domestic air transportation marketplace; (F) the taxes and user fees imposed on air carriers; (G) the responsibilities imposed on air carriers; (H) the bankruptcy laws of the United States and related rules administered by the Department of Transportation as such laws and rules apply to air carriers; (I) the obligations of failing air carriers to meet pension obligations; (J) antitrust immunity for international air carrier alliances and the process for approving such alliances and awarding that immunity; (K) competition of air carrier codeshare partnerships and joint ventures; and (L) constraints on new entry into the domestic air transportation marketplace; (3) whether the policies and strategies of the United States in international air transportation are promoting the ability of United States air carriers to achieve long-term competitive success in international air transportation markets, and to secure the benefits of robust competition, including-- (A) the general negotiating policy of the United States with respect to international air transportation; (B) the desirability of multilateral rather than bilateral negotiations with respect to international air transportation; (C) whether foreign countries have developed the necessary infrastructure of airports and airways to enable United States air carriers to provide the service needed to meet the demand for air transportation between the United States and those countries; (D) the desirability of liberalization of United States domestic air transportation markets; and (E) the impediments to access by foreign air carriers to routes to and from the United States; (4) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on business and leisure travelers, and travel and tourism more broadly; and (5) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on-- (A) employment and economic development opportunities of localities, particularly small and mid-size localities; and (B) former hub airports, including the positive and negative consequences of routing air traffic through hub airports. (e) Membership.-- (1) Appointment.--The Commission shall be composed of 21 members, of whom-- (A) 7 shall be appointed by the President; (B) 4 shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives; (C) 3 shall be appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives; (D) 4 shall be appointed by the majority leader of the Senate; and (E) 3 shall be appointed by the minority leader of the Senate.

(a) findings.--congress makes the following findings: (1) the people of the united states and the united states economy depend on a strong and competitive passenger air transportation industry to move people and goods in the fastest, most efficient manner. (2) in a global economy, air carriers connect the people of the united states with the rest of the world. a strong air transportation industry is essential to the ability of the united states to compete in the international marketplace. (3) a strong air transportation industry depends on competition between a number of air carriers servicing a variety of routes for domestic and international travelers, at both the national and local levels. (4) important stakeholders contribute to, and are dependent on, a robust air transportation industry, including-- (a) business and leisure travelers; (b) the tourism sector; (c) shippers; (d) state and local governments and port authorities; (e) aircraft manufacturers; and (f) domestic and foreign air carriers. (5) as a result of the consolidation of united states air carriers, there has been a precipitous decline in the number of major passenger air carriers in the united states. (6) in the past few years, the air transportation industry has become increasingly concentrated. in 2015, the top 4 major air carriers accounted for 80 percent of passenger air traffic in the united states. (7) the continued success of a deregulated air carrier system requires actual competition to encourage all participants in the industry to provide high quality service at competitive fares. (8) further consolidation among air carriers threatens to leave the industry without sufficient competition to ensure that the people of the united states share in the benefits of a well-functioning air transportation industry. (b) establishment of national commission to ensure all americans have access to and benefit from a strong and competitive air transportation industry.--there is established a commission, which shall be known as the ``national commission to ensure all americans have access to and benefit from a strong and competitive air transportation industry'' (referred to in this section as the ``commission''). (c) functions.-- (1) study.--the commission shall conduct a study of the passenger air transportation industry, with priority given to issues specified in subsection (d). (2) policy recommendations.--based on the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1), the commission shall recommend to the president and to congress the adoption of policies that will-- (a) achieve the national goal of a strong and competitive air carrier system and facilitate the ability of the united states to compete in the global economy; (b) provide robust levels of competition and air transportation at reasonable fares in cities of all sizes; (c) provide a stable work environment for employees of air carriers; (d) account for the interests of different stakeholders that contribute to, and are dependent on, the air transportation industry; and (e) provide appropriate levels of protection for consumers, including access to information to enable consumer choice. (d) specific issues to be addressed.--in conducting the study under subsection (c)(1), the commission shall investigate-- (1) the current state of competition in the air transportation industry, how the structure of that competition is likely to change during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, whether that expected level of competition will be sufficient to secure the consumer benefits of air carrier deregulation, and the effects of-- [[page s1829]] (a) air carrier consolidation and practices on consumers, including the competitiveness of fares and services and the ability of consumers to engage in comparison shopping for air carrier fees; (b) airfare pricing policies, including whether reduced competition artificially inflates ticket prices; (c) the level of competition as of the date of the enactment of this act on the travel distribution sector, including online and traditional travel agencies and intermediaries; (d) economic and other effects on domestic air transportation markets in which 1 or 2 air carriers control the majority of available seat miles; (e) the tactics used by incumbent air carriers to compete against smaller, regional carriers, or inhibit new or potential new entrant air carriers into a particular market; and (f) the ability of new entrant air carriers to provide new service to underserved markets; (2) the legislative and administrative actions that the federal government should take to enhance air carrier competition, including changes that are needed in the legal and administrative policies that govern-- (a) the initial award and the transfer of international routes; (b) the allocation of gates and landing rights, particularly at airports dominated by 1 air carrier or a limited number of air carriers; (c) frequent flier programs; (d) the rights of foreign investors to invest in the domestic air transportation marketplace; (e) the access of foreign air carriers to the domestic air transportation marketplace; (f) the taxes and user fees imposed on air carriers; (g) the responsibilities imposed on air carriers; (h) the bankruptcy laws of the united states and related rules administered by the department of transportation as such laws and rules apply to air carriers; (i) the obligations of failing air carriers to meet pension obligations; (j) antitrust immunity for international air carrier alliances and the process for approving such alliances and awarding that immunity; (k) competition of air carrier codeshare partnerships and joint ventures; and (l) constraints on new entry into the domestic air transportation marketplace; (3) whether the policies and strategies of the united states in international air transportation are promoting the ability of united states air carriers to achieve long-term competitive success in international air transportation markets, and to secure the benefits of robust competition, including-- (a) the general negotiating policy of the united states with respect to international air transportation; (b) the desirability of multilateral rather than bilateral negotiations with respect to international air transportation; (c) whether foreign countries have developed the necessary infrastructure of airports and airways to enable united states air carriers to provide the service needed to meet the demand for air transportation between the united states and those countries; (d) the desirability of liberalization of united states domestic air transportation markets; and (e) the impediments to access by foreign air carriers to routes to and from the united states; (4) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on business and leisure travelers, and travel and tourism more broadly; and (5) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on-- (a) employment and economic development opportunities of localities, particularly small and mid-size localities; and (b) former hub airports, including the positive and negative consequences of routing air traffic through hub airports.
