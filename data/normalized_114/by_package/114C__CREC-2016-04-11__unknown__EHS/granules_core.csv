Mr. President, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Thune, says that keeping Americans safe from future attacks is a top priority. He is right, of course. From Brussels to Egypt, events around the world underscore the need for stronger security measures for our Nation's air traffic. That is why I was glad when large bipartisan majorities voted last week to advance the FAA Reauthorization Act and then to strengthen it further with the most comprehensive airline security reforms in years. We appreciate Senator Thune's work with the Aviation Subcommittee chair, Senator Ayotte, as well as Senators Nelson and Cantwell, to move an amendment designed to keep passengers safer and to help deter terrorism in airports on U.S. soil. The amendment will help shore up security measures for international flights coming into the United States as well as improve vetting and inspections of airport employees. I would also like to recognize Senator Heinrich for his work to include provisions that will increase security measures in prescreening airport zones and expand preparation for active shooter events. This FAA reauthorization legislation will do more for security than any other in years. It will do more for passengers than any other in years as well. Don't take my word for it. A consumer columnist for the Washington Post labeled it ``one of the most passenger-friendly Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bills in a generation.'' It includes a number of consumer-friendly provisions, like fee disclosures and refunds for lost bags or services paid for but not received, and does so without imposing choice-limiting regulations or fees and taxes on airline passengers. This is a good bill and a good example of what can get accomplished with a Senate that is back to work. It would help keep Americans safe, both in our airports and in the skies. It has enjoyed support from both sides of the aisle. If Members have additional ideas they think might strengthen the bill further, I would again encourage them to work with the bill managers so we can continue moving forward. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1841] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, last Thursday a Gallup and Healthways survey revealed more good news about the ever-shrinking rate of uninsured Americans. Because of the Affordable Care Act, 91 percent of American adults now have health insurance. ObamaCare has been especially helpful to working Americans. For adults making less than $36,000, the uninsured rate has been cut by one-third. Ninety-two percent of Americans making between $36,000 and $90,000 a year now have health insurance. Every day more and more people who were previously without health insurance are now covered. That is especially true across racial and ethnic lines, where the uninsured rate is plummeting. According to this survey, ``across key subgroups, blacks and Hispanics have experienced the largest declines in their uninsured rates since the fourth quarter of 2013.'' The numbers really bear that out. The uninsured rate for African- Americans has dropped by more than 50 percent, and the uninsured rate for Hispanics has dropped by more than 25 percent. These are the facts. All across the Nation, our constituents are getting the health care coverage they were promised when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. So I think it is time for our Republican colleagues to stop denying the evidence. The evidence is that ObamaCare is working for the American people. Mr. President, I see no one on the floor.

Because of the Affordable Care Act, 91 percent of American adults now have health insurance. ObamaCare has been especially helpful to working Americans. For adults making less than $36,000, the uninsured rate has been cut by one-third. Ninety-two percent of Americans making between $36,000 and $90,000 a year now have health insurance. Every day more and more people who were previously without health insurance are now covered. That is especially true across racial and ethnic lines, where the uninsured rate is plummeting. According to this survey, ``across key subgroups, blacks and Hispanics have experienced the largest declines in their uninsured rates since the fourth quarter of 2013.'' The numbers really bear that out. The uninsured rate for African- Americans has dropped by more than 50 percent, and the uninsured rate for Hispanics has dropped by more than 25 percent. These are the facts. All across the Nation, our constituents are getting the health care coverage they were promised when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. So I think it is time for our Republican colleagues to stop denying the evidence. The evidence is that ObamaCare is working for the American people. Mr. President, I see no one on the floor.

Mr. President, later today the Senate will confirm Waverly Crenshaw to serve as a district judge for the Middle District of Tennessee. Mr. Crenshaw is a superb nominee with impeccable credentials and a sharp legal mind. He works at a prestigious law firm in Nashville, where he became the first ever African-American partner. Mr. Crenshaw is well liked by Democrats and well liked by Republicans. His nomination is supported by the Republican Senators from Tennessee, and the Judiciary Committee reported his nomination unanimously. Waverly Crenshaw's confirmation is desperately needed. The vacancy he will fill in the Middle District of Tennessee is a judicial emergency, meaning there are more cases than the judges in that district can administer. While I am pleased the Senate will confirm Mr. Crenshaw later today, I wonder why this eminently qualified nominee wasn't confirmed a long time ago. It has been more than a year since President Obama nominated him. The Judiciary Committee reported his nomination unanimously more than 9 months ago. That a consensus nominee like Waverly Crenshaw had to wait so long to be confirmed is another example--and not a good one--of Senate Republicans' concerted effort to undermine the American judiciary system. The Republican leader and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee are leading an all-out assault on our Nation's courts by depriving them of qualified judges. Americans know of Republicans' unprecedented obstruction of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, [[Page S1842]] Merrick Garland. Republican gridlock is precluding Judge Garland from a hearing and a vote. But that same gridlock is extending to important lower court nominees also. Republicans' slow-walking and obstruction of circuit and district court nominees is so pronounced that it is actually making history, and I am not sure it is good history. To date, this Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed only 16 judicial nominations. Today will be the 17th. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, that is good enough to make this Republican Senate the worst at confirming circuit court and district court judges. Chairman Grassley is running the least productive Judiciary Committee since World War II, measured in both judges reported out of committee and judges confirmed. Because of the Republicans' sloth, judiciary emergencies have nearly tripled, leaving our courts overworked and Americans without prompt access to their judiciary system. Republicans are refusing to do their job, and the American people are suffering as a result. Republican efforts to cripple our judiciary will reverberate for decades, preventing Americans from obtaining justice. It is time for the Republican leader and the senior Senator from Iowa to put an end to this obstruction. It is time they discontinue using the Senate Judiciary Committee as a political arm of the Republican leader's office and start doing their job. This should begin by doing their constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on President Obama's Supreme Court nominee. The Republican leader and Senator Grassley should give Judge Garland a hearing and a vote. They should stop stalling, hoping that Donald Trump or Ted Cruz will nominate Justice Scalia's successor. This should give even Republicans pause. Then the Republican leader and the Judiciary Committee should move the backlog of qualified judicial nominations who are awaiting confirmation--and there are a lot of them--nominees like Paula Xinis, whom President Obama nominated to serve as a judge for the District Court of Maryland. Ms. Xinis, who is a partner in a renowned Baltimore law firm, has 13 years of experience as a Federal public defender. For 5 years she worked as the director of training for the Office of the Federal Public Defender in all of Maryland. The Judiciary Committee reported Ms. Xinis 7 months ago. Yet, for more than half a year, Senator Grassley has ignored her nomination. She is not alone. The Republican leader is delaying other qualified, consensus nominations. Edward Stanton was nominated to the Western District of Tennessee and is supported by Senator Alexander and, of course, Senator Corker. The committee reported his nomination in October. Robert Rossiter was nominated to the District of Nebraska and has the support of both of his home State Republican Senators. The committee reported his nomination in October. And there are two nominees to the Western District of Pennsylvania, Susan Paradise Baxter and Marilyn Jean Horan, who were recommended by Senators Casey and Toomey. But even though it was recommended by a Republican Senator, the committee reported the nominations in January but hasn't done anything since. There are many other nominees whom the Judiciary Committee is ignoring altogether--not even holding hearings. So why aren't Republican Senators pressing the Republican leader to do his job and schedule votes on these stalled nominations? Why isn't the Judiciary Committee doing their part to get these judges confirmed? Why isn't the chairman of the committee doing his part? This is the same Senator Grassley who in 2008 said this: We should get our job done and confirm these nominees because that is what it takes for the judicial branch to get their work done. The judiciary needs to have the personnel to get their job done. So let's do what Senator Grassley said a few years ago. Let's get the job done. From the Supreme Court down to the district courts, let's get the job done for our Nation's judiciary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1841-S1842] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a number of my amendments to the FAA reauthorization bill. I filed Markey amendment No. 3467 to protect consumers from ridiculously high airline fees. In recent years, fees have gone up despite the fact that gas prices and airline choices have gone down. Regrettably, the only thing competitive about the current airline industry is the battle for overhead compartment space. Since 2001, 10 major airlines have become 4, allowing air carriers to charge ridiculous fees and act in uncompetitive ways. The four major airlines now control 80 percent of the seat capacity in the United States. At some major airports, passengers only have one or two airlines to choose from. Airline fees have climbed as high as the planes on which passengers are traveling. We must stop their rapid ascent to protect the everyday airline passenger. According to an excellent report released by Ranking Member Nelson last year, three airlines increased checked baggage fees by 67 percent between 2009 and 2014 and four airlines increased domestic cancellation fees by 33 percent. One increased its fee by 50 percent, and one increased its fee by 66 percent. Airlines should not be allowed to overcharge captive passengers just because they need to change their flight or check a couple of bags. It is just not fair. There is no justification for charging consumers a $200 fee to resell a $150 ticket that was cancelled well in advance when the airline can then resell that ticket for a higher fare to a different traveler. Further, airlines such as Delta, United, and American charge as much as $25 for the first [[Page S1843]] checked bag and $35 for the second bag even though there appears to be no appreciable cost increase for processing the second bag. That is $60 to check two bags one-way or $120 round-trip to check two bags. My amendment prohibits airlines from imposing fees that are not reasonable and proportional to the costs of the services provided. This commonsense consumer protection does not prevent airlines from charging fees; the amendment simply caps airline fees at a fair rate to ensure that passengers are not getting tipped upside down at the ticket counter. I am pleased that Senators Blumenthal and Klobuchar have cosponsored my amendment. I offered this amendment in the Commerce Committee, and it received a vote of 12 to 12. It is time to break this tie on the Senate floor. Further, my amendment enjoys broad support from several groups, including the National Consumers League, the Consumer Federation of America, and Travelers United. Mr. President, I intend to offer my cyber security amendments as well, Markey amendment Nos. 3468, 3469, and 3470. In December, I sent letters to 12 domestic airlines and two airplane manufactures requesting information on the cyber security protections on their aircraft and computer systems. What I found was startling. Currently, airlines are not required to report attempted or successful cyber attacks to the government. Let me say that again. Airlines are not required to report attempted or successful cyber attacks to the Federal Government. According to the National Air Carrier Association, which represents Allegiant, Spirit, and Sun Country--some of the country's smaller airlines--some of their carriers experience several hundred hacking attempts into their system every single day, but since there is no requirement to share this information with the FAA, potentially valuable cyber security information may not get to the other airlines, manufacturers, and regulators. My amendments address these concerns by mandating that airlines disclose cyber attacks to the FAA, directing the FAA to establish comprehensive cyber security standards, and commissioning a study to evaluate the safety and security risks associated with Wi-Fi on planes. My amendments enjoy broad support from the Association of Flight Attendants, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Mr. President, finally, on drone privacy, in committee we added a requirement that government operators disclose where they fly drones, the purpose of the flight, and whether the drone contains cameras, thermal imaging, or cell phone interceptors. My amendment would extend those requirements to commercial drone operators. I encourage all Senators to support my amendments. I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to address the Chamber.

Mr. President, this week the Senate is continuing its consideration of the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration and bringing important improvements in terms of aviation infrastructure and public safety. I am glad the Senate voted-- notwithstanding the impression I think people get from the outside that all we do is bicker and we don't actually solve any problems. I am glad the Senate has worked in a bipartisan way to move this legislation forward. We have a lot of heavy lifting left to do on this legislation this week, and none of these issues is easy, but it is important we do everything we can to demonstrate to the American people that our interests are their interests in moving bipartisan solutions forward for their benefit. National Crime Victims' Rights Week Mr. President, I wish to just take a moment and point out that this week is also a very important week because it is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. Too often crime victims in our country aren't treated with the fairness and respect they deserve. So often it seems as though we focus our attention on those who commit the crime and not nearly enough on those who are victims of crime they had no part in instigating but perhaps happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When we don't show the proper respect for victims of crime, it can lead to distrust in our communities between law enforcement and the public, and it can make our country a more dangerous place. The fact is, our law enforcement professionals work best with community cooperation. Frequently, the community can be the eyes and the ears for law enforcement and help give them information they need in order to prevent crime from occurring in the first place or to make a show of force to in fact deter the commission of a crime. When I was Texas attorney general, I had the privilege of overseeing our State's Crime Victims' Compensation Fund. This is an idea which said we ought to take the fines and the penalties from people who commit crimes and then use those funds to make grants to the victims of crime and the people who attempt to help them heal and recover from the consequences. Time and time again, I saw that when we don't support the victims of crime, they and their families aren't the only ones who suffer. It can also impede law enforcement efforts when they feel this disjuncture or disconnection between the victims and the law enforcement professionals. So it is important for many reasons--out of basic fairness and compassion but also in the interests of law enforcement, generally, to make sure we do everything we can to keep law enforcement and the victims of crime on the same page and the communities in which they reside. We need to continually look for ways to improve our support for crime victims. One way we can do this is by continuing assistance to State and local governments in a variety of ways. We recently had a hearing on the intersection of mental illness and law enforcement. Unfortunately, in our society today--because of the deinstitutionalization of people with mental illness, with no safety net to take its place--many people who suffer from mental illness are residing in our jails, filling our emergency rooms, or simply living on our streets. So we need to redirect more than just the 1 percent of funds currently directed by the Federal Government to State and local law enforcement for support and training. We need to redirect more of that in a targeted fashion to deal with this crisis in mental illness. Here is an anecdote. Recently, I had the chance to meet with some members of the Major County Sheriffs' Association. The sheriff of Bexar County, TX, a friend of mine, said: How would you like to meet the largest mental health provider in the United States? I said: [[Page S1844]] Well, sure. Who is that? She said: Meet the sheriff of Los Angeles County. This made a deep impression on me, and it tells me we still have a lot to do. Another example of where the Federal Government can play an appropriate support role for local and State law enforcement--and I am not suggesting the Federal Government take over State and local law enforcement, far from it. Rather, the Federal Government should recognize and support the important role that local and State law enforcement play and provide that support, where possible, here at the Federal level. Nowhere else have I found that more important recently than our efforts to try to audit and test the massive nationwide rape kit backlog. It has been estimated there are 400,000 rape kits collected from the forensic evidence from sexual assaults that remain untested. We know these rape kits contain vital DNA evidence that can put criminals behind bars, exonerate the falsely accused, and help detect those who commit crimes serially--not just once but over and over and over again until they are ultimately caught. As we know, many communities at the local level simply do not have the resources or expertise to test these rape kits in a timely fashion, so that is an area where we can help. That means that while evidence is collecting dust on a shelf for years, criminals will remain loose--unless we continue to act--and make it impossible for the victims of these crimes to find closure. I will give just one example. Last year Houston had a backlog of thousands of rape kits going back into the 1980s. Fortunately, due to resources provided by the Federal Government under the Debbie Smith Act, and with the determination of the local leadership, Mayor Annise Parker, the city of Houston, began to work with the State of Texas and the Federal Government to eliminate Houston's rape kit backlog. So far they have tested thousands of rape kits, resulting in 850 CODIS matches. That is the DNA check system run by the FBI, where when people have been arrested for offenses in the past, their DNA information is recorded in this data base and then can be matched against that collected in a rape kit or other forensic evidence. So just as a result of the city of Houston undertaking this massive effort--again, with the cooperation of the State and Federal Government--to eliminate its rape kit backlog, they have gotten 850 hits in the CODIS system. In other words, by testing the evidence they already had, Houston officials have been able to identify hundreds of people who are perpetrators of crime--because the DNA evidence does not lie--and to place them at the scene of a crime. Again, as we find out, sadly, people who commit sexual assaults frequently don't do it just once in their life. Many of them do it serially or until they get caught, looking for victims of opportunity--sometimes even children. It is terrible. Fortunately, with the tools and resources provided by the Debbie Smith Act and something called the SAFER Act, Houston will complete the testing of all backlogged rape kits this year. This is important because in the past, testing of these rape kits was viewed as mainly a way of just confirming the identity of the assailant using DNA evidence, but frequently the identity of the assailant is not an issue in these cases, and it is expensive to test rape kits. Frequently, the assailant is known and the question is one of consent or nonconsent. What we have found is by testing more rape kits--even where the issue of identity is not in question--we can literally tie these defendants in criminal cases to other sexual assaults in a way that is a pretty powerful and pretty revolutionary way. I am proud of the work Houston and the State of Texas are doing, working with the Federal Government, to end the rape kit backlog, but it is going to take a lot more work from us on an ongoing and long-term basis because, first, one of the things we need to do, which Congress has already required, is an audit to make sure we know where all of these rape kits are--whether they are sitting in an evidence locker or whether they are still sitting in a police station in an investigation locker. We need to make sure there is an audit done so we can get our arms around the size and scope of the problem. Then we need to redirect more of the resources the Federal Government has already appropriated money for under the Debbie Smith Act to actually test these rape kits. This is very important because we need the survivors of sexual assault to know we continue to stand with them in their fight. Thank goodness for brave women such as Debbie Smith and so many others whom I have met along the way who I think demonstrate not only their own courage but also give other people courage to stand up for their own rights when they are, through no fault of their own, victims of sexual assault. The Crime Victims' Rights Week is more than just about this crime of sexual assault. It is about respect for all victims of crime. That is why I am proud to be working with the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and Congressman Ted Poe of Houston, TX, on the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. This is comprehensive legislation to increase rights and protections for crime victims across the country. It will reauthorize the landmark Justice for All Act signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2004. As part of the reauthorization, it will also increase the collection of compensation and restitution for crime victims, it will protect the housing rights of domestic violence victims, and it will strengthen the forensic sciences to swiftly put criminals behind bars and to improve the integrity of the forensic testing. Frequently, we know that both the expertise and the equipment used by local governments and law enforcement are sometimes pretty spotty. In order to maintain the integrity of this important and powerful type of evidence, it is very importants we provide some guidance--perhaps best practices--for forensic sciences. We have the ability to do that because of the resources of the Federal Government; again, not to commander or mandate but basically to help local and State governments improve their forensic sciences and their testing. This legislation will also improve access to legal and health care resources for all victims and will ensure that we are efficiently providing direct services for crime victims on a national basis. This legislation is supported by more than 130 different law enforcement and victim advocacy organizations nationwide, including the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network--the so-called RAINN organization--the National District Attorneys Association, the National Center for Victims of Crime, the International Union of Police Organizations, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, and the National Organization for Women. It is a pretty broad spectrum of organizations along the political or ideological spectrum, and they are all unified in supporting this important bill. This Chamber has done what it takes to help victims in the past, and we should continue to build on the legacy of legislation like the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a law that is already making a clear difference in the lives of victims across the country. One of the best moments in this Chamber last year was when we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act by a vote of 99 to 0. It was a rare and welcomed coming together of all Members, from all different parts of the country, all across the ideological spectrum, to enact the most important assistance for victims of human trafficking that we have done in basically 25 years, providing for something as basic as shelter for victims of human trafficking, when many of them had nowhere to live or to turn. One of the important pieces of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was something called the HERO Program. This was primarily inserted into the legislation at the request of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Mark Kirk, a veteran of the U.S. Navy himself. Just yesterday, the Army Times ran a story on a program that was permanently authorized under the bill known as HERO, which trains veterans to work alongside Federal law enforcement officials to go after child predators--in other words, using some of the expertise the veterans acquired in their training and their service in the military to help victims of child pornography and the predation, unfortunately, that happens too often on the most innocent. So far, according to this article, the program has already trained about 80 different veterans with plans to train [[Page S1845]] 40 more this year, giving many of these veterans--some of whom have been seriously injured during the course of their military service--a real purpose in life. Indeed, in the Army Times story I mentioned just a moment ago, there are some heartrending, touching stories about how, even for people who suffered very traumatic injuries during their military service, this gives them a new sense of purpose and focus, and it is very, very encouraging. I had the chance to see the HERO program in action last year in San Antonio, and it is protecting our children and taking criminals off the street. It is pretty clear that when we set our minds to it, we can make a difference in the lives of crime victims. We proved that with the passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and we can do it again. I encourage all of our colleagues to consider supporting the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. This is a bicameral, bipartisan proposal that would help victims get the support they need and they deserve. As advocates and survivors across the country use this week to highlight the needs of millions of crime victims, let's also remember that we have a responsibility and an opportunity to do something about it right here in this Chamber. Mr. President, I don't see anyone interested in recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ZIKA VIRUS Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the Zika virus is getting very serious. Today one of the officials at the Centers for Disease Control said that ``this is scarier than we initially thought.'' As to a pregnant woman who is infected with the Zika virus, it may not only cause the fetus to be deformed with a much smaller head, but they are finding other birth defects as well as premature births. Normal, otherwise healthy people who become infected with the virus usually have relatively mild flu- like symptoms, but there are devastating consequences when the virus is contracted by a woman who is pregnant. Today the CDC said: ``Most of what we've learned is not reassuring.'' They also said: ``Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought.'' That is coming straight from the experts at CDC. When you look at where this virus is, unfortunately, there are more people in my State of Florida who have the virus than in any other State in the country. Nationwide, there are multiples of hundreds who have the virus. In the State of Florida, we have identified just under 100 people who have the virus. Thankfully, of those who were infected in Florida, none of them contracted it in Florida; they contracted the virus someplace else. There is a vast amount of traveling that goes on between Florida and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is one source where the virus is coming from. When that mosquito bites you, it transmits the virus, and that mosquito is quite prevalent in Puerto Rico. So the island is having its own trauma with the Zika virus manifesting there, but there is also a source in other countries throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and Latin America. What do we need to do? Well, one little bit of good news I can give you is that the bill we passed in the Senate before the Easter recess is now in the House, and it will be taken up by the House tomorrow. They should pass it and send it to the President's desk for signature. What that bill does is give financial incentive to the drug companies by adding Zika as a virus to the list of tropical diseases for which the drug companies have a financial incentive to go and find a cure or a vaccine. This bill is complicated as far as what the financial incentives will be. I could explain that, but for purposes of discussion here, I just wanted to share that little bit of good news. We are going to have that bill in law, and we want to unleash the creative potential of our pharmaceutical industry to go and find a cure or vaccine that will take care of it. The other side of it is what the CDC is saying is scarier than we thought, and that is the fact that it is having such devastating societal and medical consequences for a woman who is pregnant and gets the virus. We can imagine the trauma to that family with a deformed child being born as a result of the virus. We can imagine the expense to society of a child who is severely handicapped. As a result, we are talking about major effort. There is something else we can do about it; that is, the President's budgetary request has $1.9 billion specifically targeted for helping to do the research on the Zika virus. It is my hope, and I know I have the cooperation and, indeed, the considerable help and energy of my colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, in wanting to seek this and to get successfully in the appropriations bill for the Department of HHS the $1.9 billion to continue the research and all of the ancillary expenses that are coming as a result of it. Down the road, we will find a vaccine. Down the road, we will be able to manage this problem. But, in the meantime, there is a great deal of trauma, some extraordinary heartbreak to some families, which should be, again, the warning: If you are pregnant, do not go anywhere exposing the skin to a mosquito bite, particularly in those regions with that variety of mosquito that carries the Zika virus. So I hope by this time tomorrow night, we will say one hallelujah that the House bill has passed, the Senate bill has passed the House, and it is on the way to the President's desk for signature. Then, let's take up this issue in the appropriations bill when it hits the floor in another few weeks. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1843-S1845] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week the Senate is continuing its consideration of the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration and bringing important improvements in terms of aviation infrastructure and public safety. I am glad the Senate voted-- notwithstanding the impression I think people get from the outside that all we do is bicker and we don't actually solve any problems. I am glad the Senate has worked in a bipartisan way to move this legislation forward. We have a lot of heavy lifting left to do on this legislation this week, and none of these issues is easy, but it is important we do everything we can to demonstrate to the American people that our interests are their interests in moving bipartisan solutions forward for their benefit. National Crime Victims' Rights Week Mr. President, I wish to just take a moment and point out that this week is also a very important week because it is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. Too often crime victims in our country aren't treated with the fairness and respect they deserve. So often it seems as though we focus our attention on those who commit the crime and not nearly enough on those who are victims of crime they had no part in instigating but perhaps happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When we don't show the proper respect for victims of crime, it can lead to distrust in our communities between law enforcement and the public, and it can make our country a more dangerous place. The fact is, our law enforcement professionals work best with community cooperation. Frequently, the community can be the eyes and the ears for law enforcement and help give them information they need in order to prevent crime from occurring in the first place or to make a show of force to in fact deter the commission of a crime. When I was Texas attorney general, I had the privilege of overseeing our State's Crime Victims' Compensation Fund. This is an idea which said we ought to take the fines and the penalties from people who commit crimes and then use those funds to make grants to the victims of crime and the people who attempt to help them heal and recover from the consequences. Time and time again, I saw that when we don't support the victims of crime, they and their families aren't the only ones who suffer. It can also impede law enforcement efforts when they feel this disjuncture or disconnection between the victims and the law enforcement professionals. So it is important for many reasons--out of basic fairness and compassion but also in the interests of law enforcement, generally, to make sure we do everything we can to keep law enforcement and the victims of crime on the same page and the communities in which they reside. We need to continually look for ways to improve our support for crime victims. One way we can do this is by continuing assistance to State and local governments in a variety of ways. We recently had a hearing on the intersection of mental illness and law enforcement. Unfortunately, in our society today--because of the deinstitutionalization of people with mental illness, with no safety net to take its place--many people who suffer from mental illness are residing in our jails, filling our emergency rooms, or simply living on our streets. So we need to redirect more than just the 1 percent of funds currently directed by the Federal Government to State and local law enforcement for support and training. We need to redirect more of that in a targeted fashion to deal with this crisis in mental illness. Here is an anecdote. Recently, I had the chance to meet with some members of the Major County Sheriffs' Association. The sheriff of Bexar County, TX, a friend of mine, said: How would you like to meet the largest mental health provider in the United States? I said: [[Page S1844]] Well, sure. Who is that? She said: Meet the sheriff of Los Angeles County. This made a deep impression on me, and it tells me we still have a lot to do. Another example of where the Federal Government can play an appropriate support role for local and State law enforcement--and I am not suggesting the Federal Government take over State and local law enforcement, far from it. Rather, the Federal Government should recognize and support the important role that local and State law enforcement play and provide that support, where possible, here at the Federal level. Nowhere else have I found that more important recently than our efforts to try to audit and test the massive nationwide rape kit backlog. It has been estimated there are 400,000 rape kits collected from the forensic evidence from sexual assaults that remain untested. We know these rape kits contain vital DNA evidence that can put criminals behind bars, exonerate the falsely accused, and help detect those who commit crimes serially--not just once but over and over and over again until they are ultimately caught. As we know, many communities at the local level simply do not have the resources or expertise to test these rape kits in a timely fashion, so that is an area where we can help. That means that while evidence is collecting dust on a shelf for years, criminals will remain loose--unless we continue to act--and make it impossible for the victims of these crimes to find closure. I will give just one example. Last year Houston had a backlog of thousands of rape kits going back into the 1980s. Fortunately, due to resources provided by the Federal Government under the Debbie Smith Act, and with the determination of the local leadership, Mayor Annise Parker, the city of Houston, began to work with the State of Texas and the Federal Government to eliminate Houston's rape kit backlog. So far they have tested thousands of rape kits, resulting in 850 CODIS matches. That is the DNA check system run by the FBI, where when people have been arrested for offenses in the past, their DNA information is recorded in this data base and then can be matched against that collected in a rape kit or other forensic evidence. So just as a result of the city of Houston undertaking this massive effort--again, with the cooperation of the State and Federal Government--to eliminate its rape kit backlog, they have gotten 850 hits in the CODIS system. In other words, by testing the evidence they already had, Houston officials have been able to identify hundreds of people who are perpetrators of crime--because the DNA evidence does not lie--and to place them at the scene of a crime. Again, as we find out, sadly, people who commit sexual assaults frequently don't do it just once in their life. Many of them do it serially or until they get caught, looking for victims of opportunity--sometimes even children. It is terrible. Fortunately, with the tools and resources provided by the Debbie Smith Act and something called the SAFER Act, Houston will complete the testing of all backlogged rape kits this year. This is important because in the past, testing of these rape kits was viewed as mainly a way of just confirming the identity of the assailant using DNA evidence, but frequently the identity of the assailant is not an issue in these cases, and it is expensive to test rape kits. Frequently, the assailant is known and the question is one of consent or nonconsent. What we have found is by testing more rape kits--even where the issue of identity is not in question--we can literally tie these defendants in criminal cases to other sexual assaults in a way that is a pretty powerful and pretty revolutionary way. I am proud of the work Houston and the State of Texas are doing, working with the Federal Government, to end the rape kit backlog, but it is going to take a lot more work from us on an ongoing and long-term basis because, first, one of the things we need to do, which Congress has already required, is an audit to make sure we know where all of these rape kits are--whether they are sitting in an evidence locker or whether they are still sitting in a police station in an investigation locker. We need to make sure there is an audit done so we can get our arms around the size and scope of the problem. Then we need to redirect more of the resources the Federal Government has already appropriated money for under the Debbie Smith Act to actually test these rape kits. This is very important because we need the survivors of sexual assault to know we continue to stand with them in their fight. Thank goodness for brave women such as Debbie Smith and so many others whom I have met along the way who I think demonstrate not only their own courage but also give other people courage to stand up for their own rights when they are, through no fault of their own, victims of sexual assault. The Crime Victims' Rights Week is more than just about this crime of sexual assault. It is about respect for all victims of crime. That is why I am proud to be working with the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and Congressman Ted Poe of Houston, TX, on the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. This is comprehensive legislation to increase rights and protections for crime victims across the country. It will reauthorize the landmark Justice for All Act signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2004. As part of the reauthorization, it will also increase the collection of compensation and restitution for crime victims, it will protect the housing rights of domestic violence victims, and it will strengthen the forensic sciences to swiftly put criminals behind bars and to improve the integrity of the forensic testing. Frequently, we know that both the expertise and the equipment used by local governments and law enforcement are sometimes pretty spotty. In order to maintain the integrity of this important and powerful type of evidence, it is very importants we provide some guidance--perhaps best practices--for forensic sciences. We have the ability to do that because of the resources of the Federal Government; again, not to commander or mandate but basically to help local and State governments improve their forensic sciences and their testing. This legislation will also improve access to legal and health care resources for all victims and will ensure that we are efficiently providing direct services for crime victims on a national basis. This legislation is supported by more than 130 different law enforcement and victim advocacy organizations nationwide, including the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network--the so-called RAINN organization--the National District Attorneys Association, the National Center for Victims of Crime, the International Union of Police Organizations, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, and the National Organization for Women. It is a pretty broad spectrum of organizations along the political or ideological spectrum, and they are all unified in supporting this important bill. This Chamber has done what it takes to help victims in the past, and we should continue to build on the legacy of legislation like the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a law that is already making a clear difference in the lives of victims across the country. One of the best moments in this Chamber last year was when we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act by a vote of 99 to 0. It was a rare and welcomed coming together of all Members, from all different parts of the country, all across the ideological spectrum, to enact the most important assistance for victims of human trafficking that we have done in basically 25 years, providing for something as basic as shelter for victims of human trafficking, when many of them had nowhere to live or to turn. One of the important pieces of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was something called the HERO Program. This was primarily inserted into the legislation at the request of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Mark Kirk, a veteran of the U.S. Navy himself. Just yesterday, the Army Times ran a story on a program that was permanently authorized under the bill known as HERO, which trains veterans to work alongside Federal law enforcement officials to go after child predators--in other words, using some of the expertise the veterans acquired in their training and their service in the military to help victims of child pornography and the predation, unfortunately, that happens too often on the most innocent. So far, according to this article, the program has already trained about 80 different veterans with plans to train [[Page S1845]] 40 more this year, giving many of these veterans--some of whom have been seriously injured during the course of their military service--a real purpose in life. Indeed, in the Army Times story I mentioned just a moment ago, there are some heartrending, touching stories about how, even for people who suffered very traumatic injuries during their military service, this gives them a new sense of purpose and focus, and it is very, very encouraging.

In order to maintain the integrity of this important and powerful type of evidence, it is very importants we provide some guidance--perhaps best practices--for forensic sciences. We have the ability to do that because of the resources of the Federal Government; again, not to commander or mandate but basically to help local and State governments improve their forensic sciences and their testing. This legislation will also improve access to legal and health care resources for all victims and will ensure that we are efficiently providing direct services for crime victims on a national basis. This legislation is supported by more than 130 different law enforcement and victim advocacy organizations nationwide, including the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network--the so-called RAINN organization--the National District Attorneys Association, the National Center for Victims of Crime, the International Union of Police Organizations, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, and the National Organization for Women. It is a pretty broad spectrum of organizations along the political or ideological spectrum, and they are all unified in supporting this important bill. This Chamber has done what it takes to help victims in the past, and we should continue to build on the legacy of legislation like the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a law that is already making a clear difference in the lives of victims across the country. One of the best moments in this Chamber last year was when we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act by a vote of 99 to 0. It was a rare and welcomed coming together of all Members, from all different parts of the country, all across the ideological spectrum, to enact the most important assistance for victims of human trafficking that we have done in basically 25 years, providing for something as basic as shelter for victims of human trafficking, when many of them had nowhere to live or to turn. One of the important pieces of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was something called the HERO Program. This was primarily inserted into the legislation at the request of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Mark Kirk, a veteran of the U.S. Navy himself. Just yesterday, the Army Times ran a story on a program that was permanently authorized under the bill known as HERO, which trains veterans to work alongside Federal law enforcement officials to go after child predators--in other words, using some of the expertise the veterans acquired in their training and their service in the military to help victims of child pornography and the predation, unfortunately, that happens too often on the most innocent. So far, according to this article, the program has already trained about 80 different veterans with plans to train [[Page S1845]] 40 more this year, giving many of these veterans--some of whom have been seriously injured during the course of their military service--a real purpose in life. Indeed, in the Army Times story I mentioned just a moment ago, there are some heartrending, touching stories about how, even for people who suffered very traumatic injuries during their military service, this gives them a new sense of purpose and focus, and it is very, very encouraging. I had the chance to see the HERO program in action last year in San Antonio, and it is protecting our children and taking criminals off the street. It is pretty clear that when we set our minds to it, we can make a difference in the lives of crime victims. We proved that with the passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and we can do it again. I encourage all of our colleagues to consider supporting the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. This is a bicameral, bipartisan proposal that would help victims get the support they need and they deserve. As advocates and survivors across the country use this week to highlight the needs of millions of crime victims, let's also remember that we have a responsibility and an opportunity to do something about it right here in this Chamber. Mr. President, I don't see anyone interested in recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ZIKA VIRUS Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the Zika virus is getting very serious. Today one of the officials at the Centers for Disease Control said that ``this is scarier than we initially thought.'' As to a pregnant woman who is infected with the Zika virus, it may not only cause the fetus to be deformed with a much smaller head, but they are finding other birth defects as well as premature births. Normal, otherwise healthy people who become infected with the virus usually have relatively mild flu- like symptoms, but there are devastating consequences when the virus is contracted by a woman who is pregnant. Today the CDC said: ``Most of what we've learned is not reassuring.'' They also said: ``Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought.'' That is coming straight from the experts at CDC. When you look at where this virus is, unfortunately, there are more people in my State of Florida who have the virus than in any other State in the country. Nationwide, there are multiples of hundreds who have the virus. In the State of Florida, we have identified just under 100 people who have the virus. Thankfully, of those who were infected in Florida, none of them contracted it in Florida; they contracted the virus someplace else. There is a vast amount of traveling that goes on between Florida and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is one source where the virus is coming from. When that mosquito bites you, it transmits the virus, and that mosquito is quite prevalent in Puerto Rico. So the island is having its own trauma with the Zika virus manifesting there, but there is also a source in other countries throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and Latin America. What do we need to do? Well, one little bit of good news I can give you is that the bill we passed in the Senate before the Easter recess is now in the House, and it will be taken up by the House tomorrow. They should pass it and send it to the President's desk for signature. What that bill does is give financial incentive to the drug companies by adding Zika as a virus to the list of tropical diseases for which the drug companies have a financial incentive to go and find a cure or a vaccine. This bill is complicated as far as what the financial incentives will be. I could explain that, but for purposes of discussion here, I just wanted to share that little bit of good news. We are going to have that bill in law, and we want to unleash the creative potential of our pharmaceutical industry to go and find a cure or vaccine that will take care of it. The other side of it is what the CDC is saying is scarier than we thought, and that is the fact that it is having such devastating societal and medical consequences for a woman who is pregnant and gets the virus. We can imagine the trauma to that family with a deformed child being born as a result of the virus. We can imagine the expense to society of a child who is severely handicapped. As a result, we are talking about major effort. There is something else we can do about it; that is, the President's budgetary request has $1.9 billion specifically targeted for helping to do the research on the Zika virus. It is my hope, and I know I have the cooperation and, indeed, the considerable help and energy of my colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, in wanting to seek this and to get successfully in the appropriations bill for the Department of HHS the $1.9 billion to continue the research and all of the ancillary expenses that are coming as a result of it. Down the road, we will find a vaccine. Down the road, we will be able to manage this problem. But, in the meantime, there is a great deal of trauma, some extraordinary heartbreak to some families, which should be, again, the warning: If you are pregnant, do not go anywhere exposing the skin to a mosquito bite, particularly in those regions with that variety of mosquito that carries the Zika virus. So I hope by this time tomorrow night, we will say one hallelujah that the House bill has passed, the Senate bill has passed the House, and it is on the way to the President's desk for signature. Then, let's take up this issue in the appropriations bill when it hits the floor in another few weeks. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_161.csv,19842,19842,19909,"[congressional record volume 162, number 54 (monday, april 11, 2016)] [senate] [pages s1843-s1845] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] america's small business tax relief act of 2015 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of h.r. 636, which the clerk will report. the bill clerk read as follows: a bill (h.r. 636) to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to permanently extend increased

representatives. mr. cornyn. mr. president, this week the senate is continuing its consideration of the reauthorization of the federal aviation administration and bringing important improvements in terms of aviation infrastructure and public safety. i am glad the senate voted-- notwithstanding the impression i think people get from the outside that all we do is bicker and we don't actually solve any problems. i am glad the senate has worked in a bipartisan way to move this legislation forward. we have a lot of heavy lifting left to do on this legislation this week, and none of these issues is easy, but it is important we do everything we can to demonstrate to the american people that our interests are their interests in moving bipartisan solutions forward for their benefit. national crime victims' rights week mr. president, i wish to just take a moment and point out that this week is also a very important week because it is national crime victims' rights week. too often crime victims in our country aren't treated with the fairness and respect they deserve. so often it seems as though we focus our attention on those who commit the crime and not nearly enough on those who are victims of crime they had no part in instigating but perhaps happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. when we don't show the proper respect for victims of crime, it can lead to distrust in our communities between law enforcement and the public, and it can make our country a more dangerous place. the fact is, our law enforcement professionals work best with community cooperation. frequently, the community can be the eyes and the ears for law enforcement and help give them information they need in order to prevent crime from occurring in the first place or to make a show of force to in fact deter the commission of a crime. when i was texas attorney general, i had the privilege of overseeing our state's crime victims' compensation fund. this is an idea which said we ought to take the fines and the penalties from people who commit crimes and then use those funds to make grants to the victims of crime and the people who attempt to help them heal and recover from the consequences. time and time again, i saw that when we don't support the victims of crime, they and their families aren't the only ones who suffer. it can also impede law enforcement efforts when they feel this disjuncture or disconnection between the victims and the law enforcement professionals. so it is important for many reasons--out of basic fairness and compassion but also in the interests of law enforcement, generally, to make sure we do everything we can to keep law enforcement and the victims of crime on the same page and the communities in which they reside. we need to continually look for ways to improve our support for crime victims. one way we can do this is by continuing assistance to state and local governments in a variety of ways. we recently had a hearing on the intersection of mental illness and law enforcement. unfortunately, in our society today--because of the deinstitutionalization of people with mental illness, with no safety net to take its place--many people who suffer from mental illness are residing in our jails, filling our emergency rooms, or simply living on our streets. so we need to redirect more than just the 1 percent of funds currently directed by the federal government to state and local law enforcement for support and training. we need to redirect more of that in a targeted fashion to deal with this crisis in mental illness. here is an anecdote. recently, i had the chance to meet with some members of the major county sheriffs' association. the sheriff of bexar county, tx, a friend of mine, said: how would you like to meet the largest mental health provider in the united states? i said: [[page s1844]] well, sure. who is that? she said: meet the sheriff of los angeles county. this made a deep impression on me, and it tells me we still have a lot to do. another example of where the federal government can play an appropriate support role for local and state law enforcement--and i am not suggesting the federal government take over state and local law enforcement, far from it. rather, the federal government should recognize and support the important role that local and state law enforcement play and provide that support, where possible, here at the federal level. nowhere else have i found that more important recently than our efforts to try to audit and test the massive nationwide rape kit backlog. it has been estimated there are 400,000 rape kits collected from the forensic evidence from sexual assaults that remain untested. we know these rape kits contain vital dna evidence that can put criminals behind bars, exonerate the falsely accused, and help detect those who commit crimes serially--not just once but over and over and over again until they are ultimately caught. as we know, many communities at the local level simply do not have the resources or expertise to test these rape kits in a timely fashion, so that is an area where we can help. that means that while evidence is collecting dust on a shelf for years, criminals will remain loose--unless we continue to act--and make it impossible for the victims of these crimes to find closure. i will give just one example. last year houston had a backlog of thousands of rape kits going back into the 1980s. fortunately, due to resources provided by the federal government under the debbie smith act, and with the determination of the local leadership, mayor annise parker, the city of houston, began to work with the state of texas and the federal government to eliminate houston's rape kit backlog. so far they have tested thousands of rape kits, resulting in 850 codis matches. that is the dna check system run by the fbi, where when people have been arrested for offenses in the past, their dna information is recorded in this data base and then can be matched against that collected in a rape kit or other forensic evidence. so just as a result of the city of houston undertaking this massive effort--again, with the cooperation of the state and federal government--to eliminate its rape kit backlog, they have gotten 850 hits in the codis system. in other words, by testing the evidence they already had, houston officials have been able to identify hundreds of people who are perpetrators of crime--because the dna evidence does not lie--and to place them at the scene of a crime. again, as we find out, sadly, people who commit sexual assaults frequently don't do it just once in their life. many of them do it serially or until they get caught, looking for victims of opportunity--sometimes even children. it is terrible. fortunately, with the tools and resources provided by the debbie smith act and something called the safer act, houston will complete the testing of all backlogged rape kits this year. this is important because in the past, testing of these rape kits was viewed as mainly a way of just confirming the identity of the assailant using dna evidence, but frequently the identity of the assailant is not an issue in these cases, and it is expensive to test rape kits. frequently, the assailant is known and the question is one of consent or nonconsent. what we have found is by testing more rape kits--even where the issue of identity is not in question--we can literally tie these defendants in criminal cases to other sexual assaults in a way that is a pretty powerful and pretty revolutionary way. i am proud of the work houston and the state of texas are doing, working with the federal government, to end the rape kit backlog, but it is going to take a lot more work from us on an ongoing and long-term basis because, first, one of the things we need to do, which congress has already required, is an audit to make sure we know where all of these rape kits are--whether they are sitting in an evidence locker or whether they are still sitting in a police station in an investigation locker. we need to make sure there is an audit done so we can get our arms around the size and scope of the problem. then we need to redirect more of the resources the federal government has already appropriated money for under the debbie smith act to actually test these rape kits. this is very important because we need the survivors of sexual assault to know we continue to stand with them in their fight. thank goodness for brave women such as debbie smith and so many others whom i have met along the way who i think demonstrate not only their own courage but also give other people courage to stand up for their own rights when they are, through no fault of their own, victims of sexual assault. the crime victims' rights week is more than just about this crime of sexual assault. it is about respect for all victims of crime. that is why i am proud to be working with the senior senator from vermont, mr. leahy, and congressman ted poe of houston, tx, on the justice for all reauthorization act. this is comprehensive legislation to increase rights and protections for crime victims across the country. it will reauthorize the landmark justice for all act signed into law by president george w. bush in 2004. as part of the reauthorization, it will also increase the collection of compensation and restitution for crime victims, it will protect the housing rights of domestic violence victims, and it will strengthen the forensic sciences to swiftly put criminals behind bars and to improve the integrity of the forensic testing. frequently, we know that both the expertise and the equipment used by local governments and law enforcement are sometimes pretty spotty. in order to maintain the integrity of this important and powerful type of evidence, it is very importants we provide some guidance--perhaps best practices--for forensic sciences. we have the ability to do that because of the resources of the federal government; again, not to commander or mandate but basically to help local and state governments improve their forensic sciences and their testing. this legislation will also improve access to legal and health care resources for all victims and will ensure that we are efficiently providing direct services for crime victims on a national basis. this

CREC-2016-04-11-pt1-PgS1845,CREC-2016-04-11,114,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR (Executive Session),"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1845-S1848] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during quorum calls be charged equally. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in December of 2014, Judge William Joseph Haynes, Jr., of the Middle District of Tennessee, assumed senior status, creating a vacancy on the Middle District bench. That vacancy has resulted in increased caseloads for the three active Federal district judges--Judge Sharp, Judge Campbell, and Judge Trauger. Fortunately, help is on the way. In June, Senator Corker and I had the pleasure of introducing Waverly Crenshaw to the Senate Judiciary Committee when it met to consider his nomination. I was pleased that the committee agreed with our position, and they reported out his nomination by voice vote the following month. It's easy to see why Tennesseans support Mr. Crenshaw and are excited about his nomination--and the prospect that the Senate will confirm him tonight. He was born in Nashville, and then he stayed--attending Vanderbilt [[Page S1846]] University for both college and law school. After law school, he clerked for Judge John Nixon in the Middle District of Tennessee, the same court where we hope he will soon serve. After his clerkship, he worked for the Tennessee attorney general before entering private practice. In 1987 he became an associate of a small labor and employment law firm in Nashville. In 1990 he joined one of our largest firms--Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis--where he is currently a partner. He is also active in the Nashville community serving as unpaid legal counsel to the Nashville Conventions and Visitors Corporation, the Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association, and the YWCA, among others. The Middle District of Tennessee is fortunate to have such a well- qualified nominee. Waverly Crenshaw is a man of good character and of good temperament, and today I encourage my colleagues to vote for his confirmation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Tennessee. Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am glad to join the senior Senator, as I have many times, but I thank him for his comments about this distinguished person whom I hope is going to be confirmed this afternoon as a district court judge. When the White House began looking for someone to fill this position, I spoke with people, as I am sure Senator Alexander did, across Middle Tennessee to really find someone who not only would serve in his position well but had, in his current role, been involved in the community and had done many other things outside of law to benefit the community itself. Certainly, this is someone who has done that. It became very clear that he has distinguished himself not only as a talented attorney but also as a well respected leader in the Nashville community. As Lamar has mentioned, he is a lifelong Middle Tennessee resident. He received his law degree from Vanderbilt University. He was the first African-American attorney at the Waller law firm, and he has been a partner since 1994. He served as Tennessee's assistant attorney general from 1984 to 1987, and as a law clerk, as was mentioned, for the Honorable John Nixon. This is exactly the branch he hopes to serve in. I am confident he will serve the people of Middle Tennessee in this new role in an honorable fashion. I am proud to be here to support him with our senior Senator and with so many other people, by the way, in Middle Tennessee who want to see him confirmed in this position. I hope others will join us today in confirming him, and I look forward to him serving. By the way, it is a place where there is a dire need to have someone of his capacity. We have many cases that are backed up. This is one of those places where we not only need someone to fill the role, but we need someone as distinguished as Mr. Crenshaw. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. This Senator looks forward to his confirmation. I hope everyone will join in confirming this nominee. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will finally vote on the nomination of Waverly Crenshaw to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Federal District Court in the Middle District of Tennessee. This vacancy has been open since December 2014, and Mr. Crenshaw was nominated over a year ago, on February 4, 2015. He has the support of his two Republican home State Senators, Senators Alexander and Corker. He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote last summer on July 9, 2015. There is no good reason why it has taken 14 months to confirm this nominee. Mr. Crenshaw is currently a partner at the law firm Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP, in Nashville. Mr. Crenshaw was the first African- American partner at Waller, and in his nearly three-decade career in private practice, he has tried approximately 50 cases to verdict. Mr. Crenshaw also served for 3 years in the Tennessee attorney general's office as an assistant attorney general. He has the experience and qualifications necessary to serve on the Federal bench, and he should be confirmed. This is our first judicial confirmation vote in 2 months. In the last 2 years of the Bush administration--with a Democratic majority--the Senate confirmed 68 judges. This new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 16 judges to be confirmed since they gained the majority last year. This record of obstruction began last year, when Senate Republicans confirmed the fewest judicial nominees in more than half a century. Senate Republican leadership is failing our Federal judiciary with their obstruction of judicial confirmations. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. Since then, vacancies have dramatically increased more than 75 percent to 79. Furthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled under Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans took over last year to 34 today. After we vote on Mr. Crenshaw's nomination, 19 judicial nominees will remain pending on the Executive Calendar. This includes nominees with home state support from Republican Senators, including Robert Rossiter for the Federal District Court in the District of Nebraska; Edward Stanton for the Federal District Court in the Western District of Tennessee; and Susan Baxter and Marilyn Horan for the Federal District Court in the Western District of Pennsylvania. We can reduce the empty judgeships in those states if Republican leadership would allow timely votes on the pending judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar. All of those nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. There should not be any further delay in confirming them. Last Thursday, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and 42 other organizations submitted a letter to Chairman Grassley expressing their dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to do its job to process nominees for our Federal trial and appellate courts, creating a growing backlog of judicial nominations. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of this letter at the end of my statement. The American people expect Senators to do their jobs. This is true with judicial nominations to the lower courts, but it is even more crucial for the Supreme Court of the United States because no one can fill in for the vacant seat on our highest Court. In just the last few weeks, the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice, so it was unable to serve its constitutional function. Refusing to consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court is not only unfair to him, it is irresponsible and a threat to a functioning democracy. A recent poll shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans--including a majority of Republicans--say that the Senate should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland. That is what the American people are saying, but Republicans are refusing to hear them. Instead of listening to their constituents, they are listening to powerful interest groups. Since public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees began in 1916, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. And based on the Senate's precedent for decades, the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland this month. A public hearing would allow Americans to engage in the process of considering the nomination and hear directly from Chief Judge Garland, but Senate Republicans continue to refuse to do their jobs. Instead, Republicans have outsourced their job to political interest groups whose only goal is to raise millions of dollars to launch a smear campaign against the nominee's admirable record of public service. These outside groups are not accountable to the American people. They do not have the American people's interest in mind. They are private, powerful groups whose only goal is to advance their own special interests at any cost. These special interest groups are spending millions of dollars in dark money to run ads distorting Chief Judge Garland's record. At the same time, Republican Senators are planning to deny Chief Judge Garland a chance to defend himself at a public [[Page S1847]] hearing. It is wrong, it is harmful, and it is unfair. Some Senators have claimed that their unprecedented obstruction against Chief Judge Garland is based on ``principle, not the person.'' But it is not principled to attack Chief Judge Garland's sterling career and then refuse to allow him the chance to respond at a public hearing. Rather than following the demands of unaccountable interest groups, Republicans should listen to the American people who want to see real leadership in Washington. Americans want Republicans to do their jobs and consider for themselves the merits of Chief Judge Garland's record through a public hearing and a vote. I am glad that several Republican Senators have agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland. This is a person who has spent almost three decades in public service and has more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. Those who meet with Chief Judge Garland will see what I have seen: that he has an exceptional legal mind and a deep respect for the Constitution. His commitment to public service is inspiring, from his days at the Justice Department working as a prosecutor on the ground in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing to his nearly two decades as a Federal appellate judge. But simply meeting with Chief Judge Garland is not enough. The Senate must act on his nomination. In the last several weeks, the Supreme Court deadlocked twice and was not able to carry out its constitutional role as the final arbiter of our Nation's laws. Where you live will impact what your rights are. That is unacceptable and contrary to our constitutional system. If Republicans' irresponsible obstruction of Chief Judge Garland does not stop, this will continue at the Supreme Court for two terms. I hope Senate Republicans will listen to the American people, roll up their sleeves, and do their job. We must carry out one of our most important and solemn responsibilities and consider the Supreme Court nomination before us. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Washington DC, April 7, 2016. Hon. Charles Grassley, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the 42 undersigned organizations, we write to express our dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to address a growing backlog of federal judicial nominations. With only 16 judges confirmed so far, the 114th Congress is on pace to have the lowest number of judges confirmed since the 82nd Congress in 1951-1952. Even worse, in the face of rising caseloads and continuing judicial emergencies, it appears that the Committee is determined to shut down the confirmation process entirely--putting political considerations ahead of the national interest in a well-functioning judicial branch, and ahead of the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to do its job of providing advice and consent on presidential appointments. While a great deal of public attention has rightly been focused on the pending nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, vacancies on the lower courts must not be lost amidst the debate. This year, President Obama has nominated seven individuals to serve on U.S. Courts of Appeal in various circuits throughout the country, including several in circuits that are currently experiencing judicial emergencies. While some senators have expressed vague and superficial reasons for opposing consideration of individual nominees, the qualifications of these nominees cannot be seriously disputed-- every one of the nominees below has an outstanding background, as well as the widespread respect of those in the legal community who know them best: Rebecca Ross Haywood (Third Circuit): Nominated on March 15, Ms. Haywood has spent most of her legal career as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, including as the Appellate Chief of the Civil Division since 2010. She regularly practices before the court to which she has been nominated--and, if confirmed, would be the first African-American woman to serve there. Lisabeth Tabor Hughes (Sixth Circuit): Nominated on March 17, Judge Hughes was appointed to the Kentucky Supreme Court in 2007 by then-Governor Ernie Fletcher and was reelected twice, including without opposition in 2014. She previously served on the Kentucky Court of Appeals (also having been appointed by Gov. Fletcher), and has extensive experience in both private practice and as a trial judge in Jefferson County, Kentucky. She would be the first woman from Kentucky on the court. Donald Karl Schott (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Mr. Schott graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1980. Since then, he has spent most of his legal career in private practice at Quarles & Brady, where he became a partner in 1987, and has extensive trial and appellate litigation experience, at both the state and federal levels, specializing in securities and business fraud, commercial disputes, health care, and energy-related issues. Myra C. Selby (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Ms. Selby spent 15 years in private practice and Indiana state government before being nominated in 1995 to the Indiana Supreme Court. She was the first African American and first woman to serve there, and authored more than 100 majority opinions, before returning to private practice in 1999. Since then, she has specialized in commercial and health care litigation. She would be the first African American from Indiana and the first woman from Indiana on the Seventh Circuit. Jennifer Klemestrud Puhl (Eighth Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 28, Ms. Puhl spent several years in private practice and as a clerk on the North Dakota Supreme Court. In 2002, she joined the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of North Dakota, where she prosecutes a wide range of criminal cases and specializes in computer hacking and cybersecurity, intellectual property, and human trafficking. She would be the first woman federal judge at any level in North Dakota. Lucy H. Koh (Ninth Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 25, Judge Koh became the first Asian American judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, having been confirmed in 2010 by a 90-0 vote. Prior to her current position, she worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee, held several positions within the Department of Justice, and spent six years in private practice. In 2008, she was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court of California for Santa Clara County by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. She would be only the second Asian American woman ever to serve on a federal circuit court. Abdul K. Kallon (Eleventh Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 11, Judge Kallon has served on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama since 2009, after being confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent. For the previous fifteen years, Judge Kallon specialized in labor and employment law as a partner at the Birmingham, Alabama firm Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP. If confirmed, Judge Kallon would be the first African American from Alabama to serve on the Circuit. In addition, the committee has failed to act on dozens of pending district court nominees--too many to list here--from throughout the country. As with the above appellate nominees, many of these nominees would fill seats in districts that are currently facing judicial emergencies. Many of the district and appellate nominees come from states in which both senators have returned their so-called ``blue slips,'' indicating their approval of the nominees. Normally, this should clear the way for hearings and up-or-down confirmation votes. Instead, these nominees have fallen victim to election-year gamesmanship. The complete obstruction of nominees is unprecedented, and the arguments some are making in defense of this obstruction are wholly unpersuasive. In 2008, the Democratic party- controlled Senate confirmed 22 judges in the last seven months of George W. Bush's presidency, including 10 in September 2008. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the Senate on average confirmed 16 judges in the second half of presidential election years. There is no legitimate reason why things should be any different in the last year of President Obama's second term. While the Committee refuses to do its job, the American people are left to pay the price. There are currently 32 judicial emergencies nationwide (16 of the pending nominees would fill these seats), and more than 40 total nominees pending in committee or on the Senate floor. Many of the pending nominees would fill vacancies in courts that have been left shorthanded for years. Donald Schott would fill a Seventh Circuit seat that has been vacant for more than six years, and more than 30 of the 46 pending nominees are nominated to seats that have been empty for more than a year. Meanwhile, the inaction is slowing the wheels of justice for all types of parties who are seeking to vindicate their legal and constitutional rights. Numerous judges have explained the consequences they and litigants face: long delays on even the most simple filings and motions, protracted waits for post- conviction sentences, spoiled evidence, witnesses whose memories fade, lost businesses and the jobs that go with them while waiting for trials, and many more. Not only is the situation rife with injustices, but it is also completely unsustainable. The Committee has a constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and a duty to the American people to simply do its job. In the coming weeks and months, our organizations will continue to make the case until it does. If you have any questions, please contact Rob Randhava, Senior Counsel at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights at (202) 466-3311, or any of the organizations listed below. As organizations that collectively represent millions of diverse [[Page S1848]] Americans who have a stake in a fair, effective judicial system, we thank you for considering our views.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1845-S1848] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomination, equally divided in the usual form. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during quorum calls be charged equally. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in December of 2014, Judge William Joseph Haynes, Jr., of the Middle District of Tennessee, assumed senior status, creating a vacancy on the Middle District bench. That vacancy has resulted in increased caseloads for the three active Federal district judges--Judge Sharp, Judge Campbell, and Judge Trauger. Fortunately, help is on the way. In June, Senator Corker and I had the pleasure of introducing Waverly Crenshaw to the Senate Judiciary Committee when it met to consider his nomination. I was pleased that the committee agreed with our position, and they reported out his nomination by voice vote the following month. It's easy to see why Tennesseans support Mr. Crenshaw and are excited about his nomination--and the prospect that the Senate will confirm him tonight. He was born in Nashville, and then he stayed--attending Vanderbilt [[Page S1846]] University for both college and law school. After law school, he clerked for Judge John Nixon in the Middle District of Tennessee, the same court where we hope he will soon serve. After his clerkship, he worked for the Tennessee attorney general before entering private practice. In 1987 he became an associate of a small labor and employment law firm in Nashville. In 1990 he joined one of our largest firms--Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis--where he is currently a partner. He is also active in the Nashville community serving as unpaid legal counsel to the Nashville Conventions and Visitors Corporation, the Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association, and the YWCA, among others. The Middle District of Tennessee is fortunate to have such a well- qualified nominee. Waverly Crenshaw is a man of good character and of good temperament, and today I encourage my colleagues to vote for his confirmation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Tennessee. Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am glad to join the senior Senator, as I have many times, but I thank him for his comments about this distinguished person whom I hope is going to be confirmed this afternoon as a district court judge. When the White House began looking for someone to fill this position, I spoke with people, as I am sure Senator Alexander did, across Middle Tennessee to really find someone who not only would serve in his position well but had, in his current role, been involved in the community and had done many other things outside of law to benefit the community itself. Certainly, this is someone who has done that. It became very clear that he has distinguished himself not only as a talented attorney but also as a well respected leader in the Nashville community. As Lamar has mentioned, he is a lifelong Middle Tennessee resident. He received his law degree from Vanderbilt University. He was the first African-American attorney at the Waller law firm, and he has been a partner since 1994. He served as Tennessee's assistant attorney general from 1984 to 1987, and as a law clerk, as was mentioned, for the Honorable John Nixon. This is exactly the branch he hopes to serve in. I am confident he will serve the people of Middle Tennessee in this new role in an honorable fashion. I am proud to be here to support him with our senior Senator and with so many other people, by the way, in Middle Tennessee who want to see him confirmed in this position. I hope others will join us today in confirming him, and I look forward to him serving. By the way, it is a place where there is a dire need to have someone of his capacity. We have many cases that are backed up. This is one of those places where we not only need someone to fill the role, but we need someone as distinguished as Mr. Crenshaw. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. This Senator looks forward to his confirmation. I hope everyone will join in confirming this nominee. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will finally vote on the nomination of Waverly Crenshaw to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Federal District Court in the Middle District of Tennessee. This vacancy has been open since December 2014, and Mr. Crenshaw was nominated over a year ago, on February 4, 2015. He has the support of his two Republican home State Senators, Senators Alexander and Corker. He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote last summer on July 9, 2015. There is no good reason why it has taken 14 months to confirm this nominee. Mr. Crenshaw is currently a partner at the law firm Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP, in Nashville. Mr. Crenshaw was the first African- American partner at Waller, and in his nearly three-decade career in private practice, he has tried approximately 50 cases to verdict. Mr. Crenshaw also served for 3 years in the Tennessee attorney general's office as an assistant attorney general. He has the experience and qualifications necessary to serve on the Federal bench, and he should be confirmed. This is our first judicial confirmation vote in 2 months. In the last 2 years of the Bush administration--with a Democratic majority--the Senate confirmed 68 judges. This new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 16 judges to be confirmed since they gained the majority last year. This record of obstruction began last year, when Senate Republicans confirmed the fewest judicial nominees in more than half a century. Senate Republican leadership is failing our Federal judiciary with their obstruction of judicial confirmations. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. Since then, vacancies have dramatically increased more than 75 percent to 79. Furthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled under Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans took over last year to 34 today. After we vote on Mr. Crenshaw's nomination, 19 judicial nominees will remain pending on the Executive Calendar. This includes nominees with home state support from Republican Senators, including Robert Rossiter for the Federal District Court in the District of Nebraska; Edward Stanton for the Federal District Court in the Western District of Tennessee; and Susan Baxter and Marilyn Horan for the Federal District Court in the Western District of Pennsylvania. We can reduce the empty judgeships in those states if Republican leadership would allow timely votes on the pending judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar. All of those nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. There should not be any further delay in confirming them. Last Thursday, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and 42 other organizations submitted a letter to Chairman Grassley expressing their dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to do its job to process nominees for our Federal trial and appellate courts, creating a growing backlog of judicial nominations. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of this letter at the end of my statement. The American people expect Senators to do their jobs. This is true with judicial nominations to the lower courts, but it is even more crucial for the Supreme Court of the United States because no one can fill in for the vacant seat on our highest Court. In just the last few weeks, the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice, so it was unable to serve its constitutional function. Refusing to consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court is not only unfair to him, it is irresponsible and a threat to a functioning democracy. A recent poll shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans--including a majority of Republicans--say that the Senate should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland. That is what the American people are saying, but Republicans are refusing to hear them. Instead of listening to their constituents, they are listening to powerful interest groups. Since public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees began in 1916, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. And based on the Senate's precedent for decades, the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland this month. A public hearing would allow Americans to engage in the process of considering the nomination and hear directly from Chief Judge Garland, but Senate Republicans continue to refuse to do their jobs. Instead, Republicans have outsourced their job to political interest groups whose only goal is to raise millions of dollars to launch a smear campaign against the nominee's admirable record of public service. These outside groups are not accountable to the American people. They do not have the American people's interest in mind. They are private, powerful groups whose only goal is to advance their own special interests at any cost. These special interest groups are spending millions of dollars in dark money to run ads distorting Chief Judge Garland's record. At the same time, Republican Senators are planning to deny Chief Judge Garland a chance to defend himself at a public [[Page S1847]] hearing. It is wrong, it is harmful, and it is unfair. Some Senators have claimed that their unprecedented obstruction against Chief Judge Garland is based on ``principle, not the person.'' But it is not principled to attack Chief Judge Garland's sterling career and then refuse to allow him the chance to respond at a public hearing.

Where you live will impact what your rights are. That is unacceptable and contrary to our constitutional system. If Republicans' irresponsible obstruction of Chief Judge Garland does not stop, this will continue at the Supreme Court for two terms. I hope Senate Republicans will listen to the American people, roll up their sleeves, and do their job. We must carry out one of our most important and solemn responsibilities and consider the Supreme Court nomination before us. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Washington DC, April 7, 2016. Hon. Charles Grassley, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the 42 undersigned organizations, we write to express our dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to address a growing backlog of federal judicial nominations. With only 16 judges confirmed so far, the 114th Congress is on pace to have the lowest number of judges confirmed since the 82nd Congress in 1951-1952.

She regularly practices before the court to which she has been nominated--and, if confirmed, would be the first African-American woman to serve there. Lisabeth Tabor Hughes (Sixth Circuit): Nominated on March 17, Judge Hughes was appointed to the Kentucky Supreme Court in 2007 by then-Governor Ernie Fletcher and was reelected twice, including without opposition in 2014. She previously served on the Kentucky Court of Appeals (also having been appointed by Gov. Fletcher), and has extensive experience in both private practice and as a trial judge in Jefferson County, Kentucky. She would be the first woman from Kentucky on the court. Donald Karl Schott (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Mr. Schott graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1980. Since then, he has spent most of his legal career in private practice at Quarles & Brady, where he became a partner in 1987, and has extensive trial and appellate litigation experience, at both the state and federal levels, specializing in securities and business fraud, commercial disputes, health care, and energy-related issues. Myra C. Selby (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Ms. Selby spent 15 years in private practice and Indiana state government before being nominated in 1995 to the Indiana Supreme Court. She was the first African American and first woman to serve there, and authored more than 100 majority opinions, before returning to private practice in 1999. Since then, she has specialized in commercial and health care litigation. She would be the first African American from Indiana and the first woman from Indiana on the Seventh Circuit. Jennifer Klemestrud Puhl (Eighth Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 28, Ms. Puhl spent several years in private practice and as a clerk on the North Dakota Supreme Court. In 2002, she joined the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of North Dakota, where she prosecutes a wide range of criminal cases and specializes in computer hacking and cybersecurity, intellectual property, and human trafficking. She would be the first woman federal judge at any level in North Dakota. Lucy H. Koh (Ninth Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 25, Judge Koh became the first Asian American judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, having been confirmed in 2010 by a 90-0 vote. Prior to her current position, she worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee, held several positions within the Department of Justice, and spent six years in private practice. In 2008, she was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court of California for Santa Clara County by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. She would be only the second Asian American woman ever to serve on a federal circuit court. Abdul K. Kallon (Eleventh Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 11, Judge Kallon has served on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama since 2009, after being confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent. For the previous fifteen years, Judge Kallon specialized in labor and employment law as a partner at the Birmingham, Alabama firm Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP. If confirmed, Judge Kallon would be the first African American from Alabama to serve on the Circuit.

Many of the pending nominees would fill vacancies in courts that have been left shorthanded for years. Donald Schott would fill a Seventh Circuit seat that has been vacant for more than six years, and more than 30 of the 46 pending nominees are nominated to seats that have been empty for more than a year. Meanwhile, the inaction is slowing the wheels of justice for all types of parties who are seeking to vindicate their legal and constitutional rights.

That vacancy has resulted in increased caseloads for the three active Federal district judges--Judge Sharp, Judge Campbell, and Judge Trauger. Fortunately, help is on the way. In June, Senator Corker and I had the pleasure of introducing Waverly Crenshaw to the Senate Judiciary Committee when it met to consider his nomination. I was pleased that the committee agreed with our position, and they reported out his nomination by voice vote the following month. It's easy to see why Tennesseans support Mr. Crenshaw and are excited about his nomination--and the prospect that the Senate will confirm him tonight. He was born in Nashville, and then he stayed--attending Vanderbilt [[Page S1846]] University for both college and law school. After law school, he clerked for Judge John Nixon in the Middle District of Tennessee, the same court where we hope he will soon serve. After his clerkship, he worked for the Tennessee attorney general before entering private practice. In 1987 he became an associate of a small labor and employment law firm in Nashville. In 1990 he joined one of our largest firms--Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis--where he is currently a partner. He is also active in the Nashville community serving as unpaid legal counsel to the Nashville Conventions and Visitors Corporation, the Tennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association, and the YWCA, among others. The Middle District of Tennessee is fortunate to have such a well- qualified nominee. Waverly Crenshaw is a man of good character and of good temperament, and today I encourage my colleagues to vote for his confirmation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Tennessee. Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am glad to join the senior Senator, as I have many times, but I thank him for his comments about this distinguished person whom I hope is going to be confirmed this afternoon as a district court judge. When the White House began looking for someone to fill this position, I spoke with people, as I am sure Senator Alexander did, across Middle Tennessee to really find someone who not only would serve in his position well but had, in his current role, been involved in the community and had done many other things outside of law to benefit the community itself. Certainly, this is someone who has done that. It became very clear that he has distinguished himself not only as a talented attorney but also as a well respected leader in the Nashville community. As Lamar has mentioned, he is a lifelong Middle Tennessee resident. He received his law degree from Vanderbilt University. He was the first African-American attorney at the Waller law firm, and he has been a partner since 1994. He served as Tennessee's assistant attorney general from 1984 to 1987, and as a law clerk, as was mentioned, for the Honorable John Nixon. This is exactly the branch he hopes to serve in. I am confident he will serve the people of Middle Tennessee in this new role in an honorable fashion. I am proud to be here to support him with our senior Senator and with so many other people, by the way, in Middle Tennessee who want to see him confirmed in this position. I hope others will join us today in confirming him, and I look forward to him serving. By the way, it is a place where there is a dire need to have someone of his capacity. We have many cases that are backed up. This is one of those places where we not only need someone to fill the role, but we need someone as distinguished as Mr. Crenshaw. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. This Senator looks forward to his confirmation. I hope everyone will join in confirming this nominee. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will finally vote on the nomination of Waverly Crenshaw to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Federal District Court in the Middle District of Tennessee. This vacancy has been open since December 2014, and Mr. Crenshaw was nominated over a year ago, on February 4, 2015. He has the support of his two Republican home State Senators, Senators Alexander and Corker. He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote last summer on July 9, 2015. There is no good reason why it has taken 14 months to confirm this nominee. Mr. Crenshaw is currently a partner at the law firm Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP, in Nashville. Mr. Crenshaw was the first African- American partner at Waller, and in his nearly three-decade career in private practice, he has tried approximately 50 cases to verdict. Mr. Crenshaw also served for 3 years in the Tennessee attorney general's office as an assistant attorney general. He has the experience and qualifications necessary to serve on the Federal bench, and he should be confirmed. This is our first judicial confirmation vote in 2 months. In the last 2 years of the Bush administration--with a Democratic majority--the Senate confirmed 68 judges. This new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 16 judges to be confirmed since they gained the majority last year. This record of obstruction began last year, when Senate Republicans confirmed the fewest judicial nominees in more than half a century. Senate Republican leadership is failing our Federal judiciary with their obstruction of judicial confirmations. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. Since then, vacancies have dramatically increased more than 75 percent to 79. Furthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled under Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans took over last year to 34 today. After we vote on Mr. Crenshaw's nomination, 19 judicial nominees will remain pending on the Executive Calendar. This includes nominees with home state support from Republican Senators, including Robert Rossiter for the Federal District Court in the District of Nebraska; Edward Stanton for the Federal District Court in the Western District of Tennessee; and Susan Baxter and Marilyn Horan for the Federal District Court in the Western District of Pennsylvania. We can reduce the empty judgeships in those states if Republican leadership would allow timely votes on the pending judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar. All of those nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. There should not be any further delay in confirming them. Last Thursday, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and 42 other organizations submitted a letter to Chairman Grassley expressing their dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to do its job to process nominees for our Federal trial and appellate courts, creating a growing backlog of judicial nominations. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of this letter at the end of my statement. The American people expect Senators to do their jobs. This is true with judicial nominations to the lower courts, but it is even more crucial for the Supreme Court of the United States because no one can fill in for the vacant seat on our highest Court. In just the last few weeks, the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice, so it was unable to serve its constitutional function. Refusing to consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court is not only unfair to him, it is irresponsible and a threat to a functioning democracy. A recent poll shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans--including a majority of Republicans--say that the Senate should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland. That is what the American people are saying, but Republicans are refusing to hear them. Instead of listening to their constituents, they are listening to powerful interest groups. Since public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees began in 1916, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. And based on the Senate's precedent for decades, the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland this month. A public hearing would allow Americans to engage in the process of considering the nomination and hear directly from Chief Judge Garland, but Senate Republicans continue to refuse to do their jobs. Instead, Republicans have outsourced their job to political interest groups whose only goal is to raise millions of dollars to launch a smear campaign against the nominee's admirable record of public service. These outside groups are not accountable to the American people. They do not have the American people's interest in mind. They are private, powerful groups whose only goal is to advance their own special interests at any cost. These special interest groups are spending millions of dollars in dark money to run ads distorting Chief Judge Garland's record. At the same time, Republican Senators are planning to deny Chief Judge Garland a chance to defend himself at a public [[Page S1847]] hearing. It is wrong, it is harmful, and it is unfair. Some Senators have claimed that their unprecedented obstruction against Chief Judge Garland is based on ``principle, not the person.'' But it is not principled to attack Chief Judge Garland's sterling career and then refuse to allow him the chance to respond at a public hearing. Rather than following the demands of unaccountable interest groups, Republicans should listen to the American people who want to see real leadership in Washington. Americans want Republicans to do their jobs and consider for themselves the merits of Chief Judge Garland's record through a public hearing and a vote. I am glad that several Republican Senators have agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland. This is a person who has spent almost three decades in public service and has more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. Those who meet with Chief Judge Garland will see what I have seen: that he has an exceptional legal mind and a deep respect for the Constitution. His commitment to public service is inspiring, from his days at the Justice Department working as a prosecutor on the ground in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing to his nearly two decades as a Federal appellate judge. But simply meeting with Chief Judge Garland is not enough. The Senate must act on his nomination. In the last several weeks, the Supreme Court deadlocked twice and was not able to carry out its constitutional role as the final arbiter of our Nation's laws. Where you live will impact what your rights are. That is unacceptable and contrary to our constitutional system. If Republicans' irresponsible obstruction of Chief Judge Garland does not stop, this will continue at the Supreme Court for two terms. I hope Senate Republicans will listen to the American people, roll up their sleeves, and do their job. We must carry out one of our most important and solemn responsibilities and consider the Supreme Court nomination before us. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Washington DC, April 7, 2016. Hon. Charles Grassley, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the 42 undersigned organizations, we write to express our dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to address a growing backlog of federal judicial nominations. With only 16 judges confirmed so far, the 114th Congress is on pace to have the lowest number of judges confirmed since the 82nd Congress in 1951-1952. Even worse, in the face of rising caseloads and continuing judicial emergencies, it appears that the Committee is determined to shut down the confirmation process entirely--putting political considerations ahead of the national interest in a well-functioning judicial branch, and ahead of the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to do its job of providing advice and consent on presidential appointments. While a great deal of public attention has rightly been focused on the pending nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, vacancies on the lower courts must not be lost amidst the debate. This year, President Obama has nominated seven individuals to serve on U.S. Courts of Appeal in various circuits throughout the country, including several in circuits that are currently experiencing judicial emergencies. While some senators have expressed vague and superficial reasons for opposing consideration of individual nominees, the qualifications of these nominees cannot be seriously disputed-- every one of the nominees below has an outstanding background, as well as the widespread respect of those in the legal community who know them best: Rebecca Ross Haywood (Third Circuit): Nominated on March 15, Ms. Haywood has spent most of her legal career as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, including as the Appellate Chief of the Civil Division since 2010. She regularly practices before the court to which she has been nominated--and, if confirmed, would be the first African-American woman to serve there. Lisabeth Tabor Hughes (Sixth Circuit): Nominated on March 17, Judge Hughes was appointed to the Kentucky Supreme Court in 2007 by then-Governor Ernie Fletcher and was reelected twice, including without opposition in 2014. She previously served on the Kentucky Court of Appeals (also having been appointed by Gov. Fletcher), and has extensive experience in both private practice and as a trial judge in Jefferson County, Kentucky. She would be the first woman from Kentucky on the court. Donald Karl Schott (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Mr. Schott graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1980. Since then, he has spent most of his legal career in private practice at Quarles & Brady, where he became a partner in 1987, and has extensive trial and appellate litigation experience, at both the state and federal levels, specializing in securities and business fraud, commercial disputes, health care, and energy-related issues. Myra C. Selby (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Ms. Selby spent 15 years in private practice and Indiana state government before being nominated in 1995 to the Indiana Supreme Court. She was the first African American and first woman to serve there, and authored more than 100 majority opinions, before returning to private practice in 1999. Since then, she has specialized in commercial and health care litigation. She would be the first African American from Indiana and the first woman from Indiana on the Seventh Circuit. Jennifer Klemestrud Puhl (Eighth Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 28, Ms. Puhl spent several years in private practice and as a clerk on the North Dakota Supreme Court. In 2002, she joined the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of North Dakota, where she prosecutes a wide range of criminal cases and specializes in computer hacking and cybersecurity, intellectual property, and human trafficking. She would be the first woman federal judge at any level in North Dakota. Lucy H. Koh (Ninth Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 25, Judge Koh became the first Asian American judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, having been confirmed in 2010 by a 90-0 vote. Prior to her current position, she worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee, held several positions within the Department of Justice, and spent six years in private practice. In 2008, she was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court of California for Santa Clara County by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. She would be only the second Asian American woman ever to serve on a federal circuit court. Abdul K. Kallon (Eleventh Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 11, Judge Kallon has served on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama since 2009, after being confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent. For the previous fifteen years, Judge Kallon specialized in labor and employment law as a partner at the Birmingham, Alabama firm Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP. If confirmed, Judge Kallon would be the first African American from Alabama to serve on the Circuit. In addition, the committee has failed to act on dozens of pending district court nominees--too many to list here--from throughout the country. As with the above appellate nominees, many of these nominees would fill seats in districts that are currently facing judicial emergencies. Many of the district and appellate nominees come from states in which both senators have returned their so-called ``blue slips,'' indicating their approval of the nominees. Normally, this should clear the way for hearings and up-or-down confirmation votes. Instead, these nominees have fallen victim to election-year gamesmanship. The complete obstruction of nominees is unprecedented, and the arguments some are making in defense of this obstruction are wholly unpersuasive. In 2008, the Democratic party- controlled Senate confirmed 22 judges in the last seven months of George W. Bush's presidency, including 10 in September 2008. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the Senate on average confirmed 16 judges in the second half of presidential election years. There is no legitimate reason why things should be any different in the last year of President Obama's second term. While the Committee refuses to do its job, the American people are left to pay the price. There are currently 32 judicial emergencies nationwide (16 of the pending nominees would fill these seats), and more than 40 total nominees pending in committee or on the Senate floor. Many of the pending nominees would fill vacancies in courts that have been left shorthanded for years. Donald Schott would fill a Seventh Circuit seat that has been vacant for more than six years, and more than 30 of the 46 pending nominees are nominated to seats that have been empty for more than a year. Meanwhile, the inaction is slowing the wheels of justice for all types of parties who are seeking to vindicate their legal and constitutional rights. Numerous judges have explained the consequences they and litigants face: long delays on even the most simple filings and motions, protracted waits for post- conviction sentences, spoiled evidence, witnesses whose memories fade, lost businesses and the jobs that go with them while waiting for trials, and many more. Not only is the situation rife with injustices, but it is also completely unsustainable. The Committee has a constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and a duty to the American people to simply do its job. In the coming weeks and months, our organizations will continue to make the case until it does. If you have any questions, please contact Rob Randhava, Senior Counsel at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights at (202) 466-3311, or any of the organizations listed below. As organizations that collectively represent millions of diverse [[Page S1848]] Americans who have a stake in a fair, effective judicial system, we thank you for considering our views.

december 2014, and mr. crenshaw was nominated over a year ago, on february 4, 2015. he has the support of his two republican home state senators, senators alexander and corker. he was voted out of the

republican leadership would allow timely votes on the pending judicial nominees on the executive calendar. all of those nominees were reported out of the judiciary committee by voice vote. there should not be any further delay in confirming them. last thursday, the leadership conference on civil and human rights and 42 other organizations submitted a letter to chairman grassley expressing

court for the northern district of california, having been confirmed in 2010 by a 90-0 vote. prior to her current position, she worked for the senate judiciary committee, held several positions within the department of justice, and spent six years in private practice. in 2008, she was appointed as a judge to the superior court of california for santa clara county by then-governor arnold schwarzenegger. she would be only the second asian american woman ever to serve on a federal circuit court. abdul k. kallon (eleventh circuit): nominated on feb. 11, judge kallon has served on the u.s. district court for the northern district of alabama since 2009, after being confirmed by the senate by unanimous consent. for the previous fifteen years, judge kallon specialized in labor and employment law as a partner at the birmingham, alabama firm bradley arant boult cummings llp. if confirmed, judge kallon would be the first african american from alabama to serve on the circuit. in addition, the committee has failed to act on dozens of pending district court nominees--too many to list here--from throughout the country. as with the above appellate nominees, many of these nominees would fill seats in districts that are currently facing judicial emergencies. many of the district and appellate nominees come from states in which both senators have returned their so-called ``blue slips,'' indicating their approval of the nominees. normally, this should clear the way for hearings and up-or-down confirmation votes. instead, these nominees have fallen victim to election-year gamesmanship. the complete obstruction of nominees is unprecedented, and the arguments some are making in defense of this obstruction are wholly unpersuasive. in 2008, the democratic party- controlled senate confirmed 22 judges in the last seven months of george w. bush's presidency, including 10 in september 2008. during ronald reagan's presidency, the senate on average confirmed 16 judges in the second half of presidential election years. there is no legitimate reason why things should be any different in the last year of president obama's second term. while the committee refuses to do its job, the american people are left to pay the price. there are currently 32 judicial emergencies nationwide (16 of the pending nominees would fill these seats), and more than 40 total nominees pending in committee or on the senate floor. many of the pending nominees would fill vacancies in courts that have been left shorthanded for years. donald schott would fill a seventh circuit seat that has been vacant for more than six years, and more than 30 of the 46 pending nominees are nominated to seats that have been empty for more than a year. meanwhile, the inaction is slowing the wheels of justice for all types of parties who are seeking to vindicate their legal and constitutional rights. numerous judges have explained the consequences they and litigants face: long delays on even the most simple filings and motions, protracted waits for post- conviction sentences, spoiled evidence, witnesses whose memories fade, lost businesses and the jobs that go with them while waiting for trials, and many more. not only is the situation rife with injustices, but it is also completely unsustainable. the committee has a constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and a duty to the american people to simply do its job. in the coming weeks and months, our organizations will continue to make the case until it does. if you have any

Mr. President, while we are waiting for members of the Judiciary Committee to come and speak to the judicial nomination we will vote on shortly, I want to take the opportunity to talk about a pending amendment which is being offered by Senator Bennet of Colorado and which I would recommend to the Senate that they favorably consider. It is dealing with families traveling on airlines. As you know, things get very specific about seats and how much they charge for the seats. You pay extra for some baggage and other services, and then you get into seats that are getting increasingly smaller. It is even worse for a woman who is pregnant or is traveling with small children. Senator Bennet's amendment is a family-friendly amendment. If a parent has a minor child who is going on the plane by themselves, it would require TSA to allow the parent to accompany the child throughout the screening process. To a small child, that can be quite intimidating. Secondly, it would require the airlines to provide pregnant women with the opportunity to preboard the flight. How many times have we seen everybody queueing up to get on the flight? The special advantage passengers get on, the first class passengers get on, the members of the frequent flyer program get on, and here is a lady who is quite along in her pregnancy still standing. That is just common sense. That is being gentlemanly about the rules of airlines. Thirdly, the amendment tries to keep families together because it would require the airlines to make sure that at least one adult of the family who is traveling together can sit next to the child on the plane without the airlines saying the parent will have to pay an extra fee in order to guarantee having a seat next to their minor child. This is common sense, and it is encouraging family travel. I certainly urge my colleagues to support this amendment as we will be taking up the FAA bill after this judicial nomination confirmation vote. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CREC-2016-04-11-pt1-PgS1848-4,CREC-2016-04-11,114,VIEQUES,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1848-S1850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VIEQUES Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are all concerned about the plight right now of Puerto Rico and what is happening over there financially. And later on this week I will revisit the issue of the 4-year battle of Vieques that took place from 1999 to 2003. I am very much concerned that we might have an opportunity here to rectify something that was done that should not have been done back in 2002. The island off of Puerto Rico called Vieques had been an integrated training center for many years--about 60 years--up until 2002. For purely political reasons at that time, it became quite an issue. First of all, joint training took place on the island of Vieques. Joint training means you have different branches of the military trying to accomplish something together that they couldn't do individually. In the case of Vieques, it was the Marines, the Navy, and the Air Force. We were able to do the type of training we couldn't do anyplace else. [[Page S1849]] It sounds kind of ridiculous, but when they were talking about doing away with using Vieques for a military center--what they had been doing for 60 years--it was all around an establishment called Roosevelt Roads. Roosevelt Roads was a major naval station. We had about 7,000 sailors there. They added something like $600 million a year to the economy of Puerto Rico. Anyway, we found out there was a great effort by a lot of people who I will always suspect wanted to ultimately develop that island for private purposes and to financially gain from that. Consequently, with no regard for the contribution it made to our defense, they started a major problem. One person was killed in 60 years on that island, and because that happened to have taken place, they used it as a reason to try to shut that down. It became quite a political football at that time. I know Al Gore was very much involved in that, and there were some great benefits, I am sure. From World War II through the operation in Kosovo, our military has been ready to execute combat operations due to the training they were able to get on the island of Vieques. In fact, during Kosovo they used those individuals to conduct successful operations. They were all trained at no place other than Vieques. The reason for that is if they were going into Kosovo, as our Air Force was going in, they would have to be able to draw coordinates from a high enough elevation that the surface-to-air missiles would not be able to reach them, for their safety. And if we hadn't had all those guys over there who were trained at Vieques, it was speculated that they would not have been successful. Secretary Richard Danzig, who was then the Secretary of the Navy, said that ``only by providing this preparation can we fairly ask our servicemembers to put their lives at risk.'' Admiral Johnson, then Chief of Naval Operations, and General Jones, then Commandant of the Marine Corps, said that Vieques provides integrated live-fire training ``critical to our readiness'' and that the failure to provide for adequate live-fire training for our naval forces before deployment will place those forces at an unacceptably high risk during deployment. Those are quotes from those two individuals. Admiral Ellis, then director of operations, plans, and policies on the staff of the commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, said during his confirmation hearing--and I was there at that time--to be commander of Strategic Command, ``Those types of facilities, particularly those in which we can bring together all of the naval, and that means both Navy and Marine Corps, combat power for integrated and joint training, are particularly useful elements of the overall warfighting preparation.'' At the time we felt there was a problem, I personally went around the world to every place that might have been a substitute for Vieques. I went to Cape Wrath--I always remember that--which I think is in northern Scotland, and I went to Southern Sardinia in Italy, and none of those places were adequate and none could provide the same type of support. Admiral Fallon, then commander of the Navy's Second Fleet, and General Pace--remember Peter Pace--the commander of all Marine Forces in the Atlantic, testified that the United States needs Vieques as a training ground to prepare our young men and women for the challenges of deployed military operations. GEN Wes Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander at that time, said: ``The live fire training that our forces were exposed to at training ranges such as Vieques helped ensure that the forces assigned to this theater''--and he was talking about Kosovo. That is when we had to be ready on arrival to fight and win and survive, which we did. CAPT James Stark, then the commanding officer of Roosevelt Roads Naval Station--there were about 7,000 of our sailors there--said: When you steam off to battle you're either ready or you're not. If you're not, that means casualties. That means more POWs. That means less precision and longer campaigns. You pay a price for all this in war, and that price is blood. Admiral Murphy, then commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, said the loss of training on Vieques would ``cost American lives.'' And it has cost American lives, and that has been since 2002. We are talking about American lives unnecessarily put at risk if they are not fully trained for combat operations. I remember one person back at that time talking about the analogous situation of a football team where you have all the quarterbacks training over here, all the backs over here, and all the defensive people training over here, but never training together, and then they go and lose. You have to have integrated training. We don't even have that today. We have tried to find and to replicate that effort, and it isn't there. This week, I understand--and the reason I came down quite unprepared is because I didn't know this was coming up--the House Natural Resources Committee is going to consider legislation that provides bankruptcy powers to Puerto Rico while subjecting it to the authority of a Federal oversight board. This is something that is going to become very controversial. There will be a lot of people around saying: Why are we doing this? And once you provide these benefits to Puerto Rico, there is no reason why others won't line up and want the same thing. I really am concerned that Puerto Rico, apparently--and I don't know if this is true, but they are saying it--owes some $73 billion in government debt. In January, Puerto Rico started defaulting on part of that debt. Section 411 of this legislation--we are talking about the legislation that will be discussed tomorrow over in the House--would turn over approximately 3,000 acres of Department of Interior conservation zones that were formerly part of Vieques. What happened in 2002 was that the land that had been used for the training range was turned over to this department. Now they are talking about taking it out, I suppose, for people to develop. I remember so well the time when we were talking about closing Vieques. I was the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Readiness Subcommittee. Puerto Rico's Governor Rossello came. He is not in office anymore. But he made all kinds of threats: It is just a bluff that it would be closing. I made the statement that if we are denied the opportunity to use the island of Vieques for joint training, then we were going to lose Roosevelt Roads. Governor Rossello sat there and said: Inhofe is not telling the truth. We are not going to lose that. Of course, they did lose it. So in 2003 the total impact from the Navy was estimated to be $600 million a year. The departure of the Navy also impacted business and contracts, as we know. I was visiting with Miriam Ramirez just today. At the time, she was in the State Senate in Puerto Rico and was talking about the disastrous economic effects if they closed Vieques. She is still concerned about that, and many of the people who were the strongest opponents of my efforts at that time to keep Vieques operating are now saying we should have left it open. So I think any kind of a deal that is made has to include consideration that the training is still available. There is still no range like Vieques anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. What can be done in Vieques cannot be done in one location by a joint force. I understand firsthand both the importance and the significance of having a range in your home State. I remember a popular TV show at that time called ``Crossfire.'' I was on the show in May of 2000. Juan Figueroa was the president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, and we were debating this on live TV. He said: Well, how would you, Inhofe, like to have a live range in your State of Oklahoma? I said: Let me tell you about Fort Sill. They train 360 days out of the year, 24 hours a day, and they make all kinds of noise. It is within 1 mile of a population of 100,000 people--at that time, Vieques was within 9.5 miles of 9,000 people--and there are all these people who hear this noise down there. They were in town last week. They said: When we hear that noise, it is the sound of freedom. Here is something interesting. They opened up what is considered to be the most modern, most progressive elementary school. They call it Freedom Elementary School. They named it after that phrase: It is the sound of freedom. [[Page S1850]] So this is what is happening. I am very much concerned that we are going to stumble and pass up an opportunity that might still be there. We have an opportunity to actually go back and use that for some of our joint training. So later this week I am going to go back and relive the history on the 4-year battle of Vieques. Hopefully, this might be an opportunity for us to save American lives and to have integrated training, which we still don't have today and which we had back in that time. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1848-S1850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VIEQUES Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are all concerned about the plight right now of Puerto Rico and what is happening over there financially. And later on this week I will revisit the issue of the 4-year battle of Vieques that took place from 1999 to 2003. I am very much concerned that we might have an opportunity here to rectify something that was done that should not have been done back in 2002. The island off of Puerto Rico called Vieques had been an integrated training center for many years--about 60 years--up until 2002. For purely political reasons at that time, it became quite an issue. First of all, joint training took place on the island of Vieques. Joint training means you have different branches of the military trying to accomplish something together that they couldn't do individually. In the case of Vieques, it was the Marines, the Navy, and the Air Force. We were able to do the type of training we couldn't do anyplace else. [[Page S1849]] It sounds kind of ridiculous, but when they were talking about doing away with using Vieques for a military center--what they had been doing for 60 years--it was all around an establishment called Roosevelt Roads. Roosevelt Roads was a major naval station. We had about 7,000 sailors there. They added something like $600 million a year to the economy of Puerto Rico. Anyway, we found out there was a great effort by a lot of people who I will always suspect wanted to ultimately develop that island for private purposes and to financially gain from that. Consequently, with no regard for the contribution it made to our defense, they started a major problem. One person was killed in 60 years on that island, and because that happened to have taken place, they used it as a reason to try to shut that down. It became quite a political football at that time. I know Al Gore was very much involved in that, and there were some great benefits, I am sure. From World War II through the operation in Kosovo, our military has been ready to execute combat operations due to the training they were able to get on the island of Vieques. In fact, during Kosovo they used those individuals to conduct successful operations. They were all trained at no place other than Vieques. The reason for that is if they were going into Kosovo, as our Air Force was going in, they would have to be able to draw coordinates from a high enough elevation that the surface-to-air missiles would not be able to reach them, for their safety. And if we hadn't had all those guys over there who were trained at Vieques, it was speculated that they would not have been successful. Secretary Richard Danzig, who was then the Secretary of the Navy, said that ``only by providing this preparation can we fairly ask our servicemembers to put their lives at risk.'' Admiral Johnson, then Chief of Naval Operations, and General Jones, then Commandant of the Marine Corps, said that Vieques provides integrated live-fire training ``critical to our readiness'' and that the failure to provide for adequate live-fire training for our naval forces before deployment will place those forces at an unacceptably high risk during deployment. Those are quotes from those two individuals. Admiral Ellis, then director of operations, plans, and policies on the staff of the commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, said during his confirmation hearing--and I was there at that time--to be commander of Strategic Command, ``Those types of facilities, particularly those in which we can bring together all of the naval, and that means both Navy and Marine Corps, combat power for integrated and joint training, are particularly useful elements of the overall warfighting preparation.'' At the time we felt there was a problem, I personally went around the world to every place that might have been a substitute for Vieques. I went to Cape Wrath--I always remember that--which I think is in northern Scotland, and I went to Southern Sardinia in Italy, and none of those places were adequate and none could provide the same type of support. Admiral Fallon, then commander of the Navy's Second Fleet, and General Pace--remember Peter Pace--the commander of all Marine Forces in the Atlantic, testified that the United States needs Vieques as a training ground to prepare our young men and women for the challenges of deployed military operations. GEN Wes Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander at that time, said: ``The live fire training that our forces were exposed to at training ranges such as Vieques helped ensure that the forces assigned to this theater''--and he was talking about Kosovo. That is when we had to be ready on arrival to fight and win and survive, which we did. CAPT James Stark, then the commanding officer of Roosevelt Roads Naval Station--there were about 7,000 of our sailors there--said: When you steam off to battle you're either ready or you're not. If you're not, that means casualties. That means more POWs. That means less precision and longer campaigns. You pay a price for all this in war, and that price is blood. Admiral Murphy, then commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, said the loss of training on Vieques would ``cost American lives.'' And it has cost American lives, and that has been since 2002. We are talking about American lives unnecessarily put at risk if they are not fully trained for combat operations. I remember one person back at that time talking about the analogous situation of a football team where you have all the quarterbacks training over here, all the backs over here, and all the defensive people training over here, but never training together, and then they go and lose. You have to have integrated training. We don't even have that today. We have tried to find and to replicate that effort, and it isn't there. This week, I understand--and the reason I came down quite unprepared is because I didn't know this was coming up--the House Natural Resources Committee is going to consider legislation that provides bankruptcy powers to Puerto Rico while subjecting it to the authority of a Federal oversight board. This is something that is going to become very controversial. There will be a lot of people around saying: Why are we doing this? And once you provide these benefits to Puerto Rico, there is no reason why others won't line up and want the same thing. I really am concerned that Puerto Rico, apparently--and I don't know if this is true, but they are saying it--owes some $73 billion in government debt. In January, Puerto Rico started defaulting on part of that debt. Section 411 of this legislation--we are talking about the legislation that will be discussed tomorrow over in the House--would turn over approximately 3,000 acres of Department of Interior conservation zones that were formerly part of Vieques. What happened in 2002 was that the land that had been used for the training range was turned over to this department. Now they are talking about taking it out, I suppose, for people to develop. I remember so well the time when we were talking about closing Vieques. I was the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Readiness Subcommittee. Puerto Rico's Governor Rossello came. He is not in office anymore. But he made all kinds of threats: It is just a bluff that it would be closing. I made the statement that if we are denied the opportunity to use the island of Vieques for joint training, then we were going to lose Roosevelt Roads. Governor Rossello sat there and said: Inhofe is not telling the truth. We are not going to lose that. Of course, they did lose it. So in 2003 the total impact from the Navy was estimated to be $600 million a year. The departure of the Navy also impacted business and contracts, as we know. I was visiting with Miriam Ramirez just today. At the time, she was in the State Senate in Puerto Rico and was talking about the disastrous economic effects if they closed Vieques. She is still concerned about that, and many of the people who were the strongest opponents of my efforts at that time to keep Vieques operating are now saying we should have left it open.

CREC-2016-04-11-pt1-PgS1850,CREC-2016-04-11,114,TRIBUTE TO ROBERT HAWKES GRAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1850-S1851] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ROBERT HAWKES GRAY Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an extraordinary Vermonter, Robert Hawkes Gray. Bob, as he is known to family and friends, grew up in Putney where his parents worked at the Putney School. His father, Edward, was in charge of buildings and grounds, and his mother, Mabel, ran the kitchen. Ed's ability to fix anything and Mabel's cooking and way of keeping order are remembered vividly and fondly to this day by thousands of Putney graduates. Bob attended Putney where he learned to ski cross-country thanks to Olympian skier John Caldwell, the father of cross-country skiing in America who taught at the school. Bob went on to run the outdoor work program at Putney and coached cross-country skiing and running. He became an Olympian himself, competing in the 1968 and 1972 winter games, and was inducted into Vermont's Ski and Snowboard Museum Hall of Fame. After skiing, Bob's lifetime passion has been farming. He and his wife, Kim, own and manage Four Corners Farm, one of the most successful vegetable and dairy farms in Vermont. Located on a beautiful hillside that levels off along the Connecticut River in South Newbury, the sprawling acreage of the farm is a model of order and astonishing productivity. Just about anything that will grow in Vermont, either in fields or in greenhouses heated by wood stoves, can be found there in abundance. Everyone knows that farm work is hard by any standard. It means rising before sunrise and long hours of strenuous physical labor that continues into the night. Anyone who visits Four Corners Farm can't help but wonder how they do it all. It is a testament to the benefits of regular physical exercise, as Bob, now 76, looks closer to 60 and has the strength of someone half his age. It wasn't all due to farming though. It is said that, when Jack Dempsey was the world heavyweight champion, Ed Gray's biceps measured the same diameter. Of course, Ed was an accomplished gardener himself. I could go on about Bob's talents as a farmer. A teacher by instinct, anyone who visits the farm may find themselves treated to a lesson in pruning tomato plants, planting and mulching strawberry seedlings, or the peculiar habits of honey bees. Kim, a former alpine ski racer herself, is also a gifted farmer whose stamp on the business can be seen everywhere. Neither could have made Four Corners Farm what it is today without the other. Bob never stopped skiing for fun, but he didn't take up racing again until the 1990s. This past winter he showed that, if you love something enough and give it everything you have got, just about anything is possible. At the World Masters cross-country ski races in Voukatti, Finland, and at the National Masters at Royal Gorge, CA, Bob won a gold medal, two silvers, and a bronze. Some might think that, by the time you get to be 76, you are probably skiing pretty slowly and there isn't that much competition in your age group anyway. Let's just say that at the Masters no one skis slowly--no one skis anything remotely like slowly. These are the best skiers in the world, and to the rest of us mere mortals, there isn't that much difference between them and today's Olympians. A March 31, 2016, article in the Valley News, entitled ``Septuagenarian Gray Skiing His Way to Wins'' tells the story. I congratulate Bob Gray. He exemplifies the very best of Vermont for his inspiring work ethic, his ski racing accomplishments, and the example he has set for future generations of Vermont skiers and farmers. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Valley News, Mar. 31, 2016] Septuagenarian Gray Skiing His Way to Wins (By Jared Pendak, Valley News Staff Writer) Newbury, VT.--Bob Gray returned to cross country skiing several years ago, primarily as a way to keep his heart pumping. As it turned out, he's more than capable of breaking the hearts of opponents. Gray, 76, recently swept a pair of races at the National Masters Championships in Soda Springs, Calif., winning the Masters 5B (ages 75-79) 10K classic race on March 19 in 33 minutes, 58.6 seconds, more than nine minutes faster than runner up Hans Muehlegger, of Idaho, and good for 20th overall in a field of 53. The next day, Gray placed fifth overall while winning his 70-79 age group in the season-ending U.S. Marathon National Championship, finishing the 14K bronze race in 48:12.1--again more than nine minutes ahead of Muehlegger. A two-time Olympian who competed on the U.S. Nordic Ski Team from 1960-74, Gray had also swept both events in the 2015 National Masters Championships, held closer to home at the Craftsbury (Vt.) Nordic Center. ``There isn't much competition for my age group in that event,'' said Gray, who co-owns the Four Corners produce and dairy farm in Newbury, Vt. ``I'd like to think part of it is that I'm in pretty good shape.'' Gray's competition was stiffer last month at the Masters World Cup in Vuokatti, Finland, where he left with two silver medals and a bronze. On Feb. 6, he bettered 75-year-old Frenchman Daniel Chopard by two seconds for second place in the 10K skate in 33:40, then beat Chopard by 35 seconds with a time of 47:34.1 in the 15K skate Feb. 12. Norwegian Finn Magnar Hagen decidedly won both skate races, finishing the 10K a good 2:40 ahead of Gray and besting him in the 15K by nearly four minutes. ``There was just no catching Finn; he was just gone,'' said Gray. ``On the other hand, me and Chopard had a great time going back and forth. We'd pass each other and say, `All right, I'll see you up ahead on the hill.' '' Neither Hagen nor Chopard competed in the 5K classic on Feb. 8, a race in which the top four were separated by just 17 seconds. Russia's Gennady Ushakov won in 18:10.9, followed by Austrian Josef Schniagl, Gray (18:19.7) and Finland's Taplo Wallenkus (18:27.9). ``I think I had a chance to win that race, but my skis just weren't up to par with some of the skis these other guys had,'' Gray said. ``I made one tactical error, started kicking too lightly and it got me off-track. I was still able to make up most of the places I lost and close the gap. It was a close race, a fun race.'' Gray, a Vermont Ski & Snowboard Museum Hall of Fame inductee whose wife, Kim, is a former U.S. Alpine skier, competed in the 1968 and '72 Olympic Games. His best finish was 12th place in the 4x1OK relay in the '68 Games in Grenoble, France, complementing three combined top-50s in individual events at Grenoble and the '72 Games in Sapporo, Japan. The Putney, Vt., native also skied four seasons in the FIS Cup (now known as the FIS World Cup), winning national titles in the 15K and 50K and earning the top U.S. ranking in 1973. The Grays opened the Green Mountain Touring Center in Randolph in 1977 while running their first farm in Hartland Four Corners, inspiring the moniker they kept even after moving operations to their plot in Newbury. Bob Gray later had about a 12-year hiatus from the sport while devoted to raising the couple's three children and farming, not strapping on skis again until the early 1990s. He competed off and on in various national and international competitions, capturing bronze at an event in Quebec City in 2001 and two silvers and a bronze five years later in British Columbia. He began refocusing on training and competing in earnest several years ago, motivated equally by the desire to keep his heart rate up as much as keeping his competitive juices going. ``When you get older, if you don't keep moving, you get sick and die,'' Gray said plainly. ``So much of your health is about staying active and exercising. I get some of that on the farm, but I'm much more of a manager type now than I used to be. So (returning to skiing) is a way to keep my heart beating.'' Like any snow sports athlete based in the area, Gray faced challenges finding suitable surfaces to train on this winter. He ventured to Craftsbury Nordic Center at times to practice on their manmade trails, but most often settled for dry-land exercises. ``I'd go up (North Haverhill's) Black Mountain, Mount Moosilauke, sometimes Mount Ascutney, always with ski poles to help practice balance,'' Gray said. ``I'd go uphill on [[Page S1851]] paved roads on rollerblades--I like rollerblades better than roller skis. I can go from here up Snake Road to West Newbury, which is about three miles, so that's perfect. The only problem with that is that I'm too tired to skate home after that so I have to have someone come get me.'' Gray, who was trained in his youth by former Dartmouth skier and Olympian John Caldwell, would like to see more kids today on Nordic skis. He's given lessons in recent years at Strafford Nordic Center and elsewhere. ``It's a great sport, a great way to get kids off of the couch or away from the computer,'' Gray said. ``Plus, you can do it until you're my age.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S1850-S1851] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ROBERT HAWKES GRAY Mr. LEAHY.

national masters championships, held closer to home at the craftsbury (vt.) nordic center. ``there isn't much competition for my age group in that event,'' said gray, who co-owns the four corners produce and dairy farm in newbury, vt. ``i'd like to think part of it is that i'm in pretty good shape.'' gray's competition was stiffer last month at the masters world cup in vuokatti, finland, where he left with two silver medals and a bronze. on feb. 6, he bettered 75-year-old frenchman daniel chopard by two seconds for second place in the 10k skate in 33:40, then beat chopard by 35 seconds with a time of 47:34.1 in the 15k skate feb. 12. norwegian finn magnar hagen decidedly won both skate races, finishing the 10k a good 2:40 ahead of gray and besting him in the 15k by nearly four minutes. ``there was just no catching finn; he was just gone,'' said gray. ``on the other hand, me and chopard had a great time going back and forth. we'd pass each other and say, `all right, i'll see you up ahead on the hill.' '' neither hagen nor chopard competed in the 5k classic on feb. 8, a race in which the top four were separated by just 17 seconds. russia's gennady ushakov won in 18:10.9, followed by austrian josef schniagl, gray (18:19.7) and finland's taplo wallenkus (18:27.9). ``i think i had a chance to win that race, but my skis just weren't up to par with some of the skis these other guys had,'' gray said. ``i made one tactical error, started kicking too lightly and it got me off-track. i was still able to make up most of the places i lost and close the gap. it was a close race, a fun race.'' gray, a vermont ski & snowboard museum hall of fame inductee whose wife, kim, is a former u.s. alpine skier, competed in the 1968 and '72 olympic games. his best finish was 12th place in the 4x1ok relay in the '68 games in grenoble, france, complementing three combined top-50s in individual events at grenoble and the '72 games in sapporo, japan. the putney, vt., native also skied four seasons in the fis cup (now known as the fis world cup), winning national titles in the 15k and 50k and earning the top u.s. ranking in 1973. the grays opened the green mountain touring center in randolph in 1977 while running their first farm in hartland four corners, inspiring the moniker they kept even after moving operations to their plot in newbury. bob gray later had about a 12-year hiatus from the sport while devoted to raising the couple's three children and farming, not strapping on skis again until the early 1990s. he competed off and on in various national and international competitions, capturing bronze at an event in quebec city in 2001 and two silvers and a bronze five years later in british columbia. he began refocusing on training and competing in earnest several years ago, motivated equally by the desire to keep his heart rate up as much as keeping his competitive juices going. ``when you get older, if you don't keep moving, you get sick and die,'' gray said plainly. ``so much of your health is about staying active and exercising. i get some of that on the farm, but i'm much more of a manager type now than i used to be. so (returning to skiing) is a way to keep my heart beating.'' like any snow sports athlete based in the area, gray faced challenges finding suitable surfaces to train on this winter. he ventured to craftsbury nordic center at times to practice on their manmade trails, but most often settled for dry-land exercises. ``i'd go up (north haverhill's) black mountain, mount moosilauke, sometimes mount ascutney, always with ski poles to help practice balance,'' gray said. ``i'd go uphill on [[page s1851]] paved roads on rollerblades--i like rollerblades better than roller skis. i can go from here up snake road to west newbury, which is about three miles, so that's perfect. the only problem with that is that i'm too tired to skate home after that so i have to have someone come get me.'' gray, who was trained in his youth by former dartmouth skier and olympian john caldwell, would like to see more kids today on nordic skis. he's given lessons in recent years at strafford nordic center and elsewhere. ``it's a great sport, a great way to get kids off of the couch or away from the computer,'' gray said. ``plus, you can do it until you're my age.'' ____________________",9189

Mr. President, I wish to recognize Maurice Geiger, known by family and friends as Maury, an extraordinary individual who, although a longtime resident of Conway, NH, with his wife, Nancy, is deserving of the title of honorary Vermonter. Maury Geiger's lengthy career began in the U.S. Navy back in the 1950s, from where he went on to Georgetown Law School and jobs at the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice. He later served as a county prosecutor in New Hampshire, founded the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier, VT, where I first got to know him, became a national expert in court administration, and has provided advice and guidance to help reform dysfunctional justice systems in foreign countries for more than two decades. In no country has Maury devoted more passion, time, and energy than Haiti, where justice has long been more of a fantasy than a reality for the majority of the Haitian people. Since the 1990s, Maury has traveled to Haiti scores of times, often paying out of his own pocket. His purpose was simple: to help improve access to justice for thousands of people caught up in a byzantine system in which it is common to be detained in squalid, grossly overcrowded, sweltering prisons rampant with life-threatening diseases, for months and years, without ever seeing a lawyer or judge or being formally charged with any crime. Over the years, often against great odds, Maury has worked to train numerous Haitian prosecutors, judges, and other judicial officials and to institute recordkeeping systems to improve case management and reduce the chance that inmates are forgotten or their case files are lost. Maury is not only among a handful of the most experienced experts in the field of court administration; he is a person of exemplary integrity. He has never had the slightest interest in profiting himself, as his modest lifestyle demonstrates, but rather to do whatever he could to provide help and dignity to those who are the least able to help themselves. He has done so, year after year, with uncommon compassion and commitment, never losing his wry sense of humor, in a country where the political will for justice reform at the highest levels of government has often been weak or lacking altogether. Maury is in Haiti again this week, and I want him to know that the example he has set of selflessness, of caring, commitment to human rights and equal access to justice, and of an unwavering belief in the basic dignity of all people regardless of their station in life, is one that every law student, every lawyer, every prosecutor, every judge, and every prison warden should strive to emulate. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1851] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MAURICE GEIGER Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, at its 214th commencement on May 14, 2016, the University of Maine at Orono will award an honorary doctorate degree to Leonard Minsky of Bangor. Today I wish to congratulate my dear friend for this recognition and to join people throughout Maine in thanking him for his uncommon generosity, vision, and dedication that have made our university's flagship campus a center for the arts and humanities. A member of the class of 1950, Leonard received an outstanding education at UMaine and has never stopped giving back. His passion for the arts and commitment to the highest expressions of human ideals are evident throughout the beautiful Orono campus. Minsky Recital Hall in the school of performing arts is a marvelous place for students, faculty, and world-class visiting artists to perform. In recent years, I have had the pleasure of hearing the University Singers, which included my niece, perform there. The Minsky Gallery in the Maine Center for the Arts celebrates the visual arts around the world. The Minsky Culture Lab at the Hudson Museum offers interactive, hands-on experiences for Maine schoolchildren and UMaine students. With Leonard's support, the UMaine Museum of Art in downtown Bangor features the best in modern and [[Page S1852]] contemporary art, from Andrew Wyeth to Andy Warhol.

Today I wish to congratulate my dear friend for this recognition and to join people throughout Maine in thanking him for his uncommon generosity, vision, and dedication that have made our university's flagship campus a center for the arts and humanities.

His passion for the arts and commitment to the highest expressions of human ideals are evident throughout the beautiful Orono campus.

CREC-2016-04-11-pt1-PgS1852-2,CREC-2016-04-11,114,TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL EDWARD P. ASH,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1852] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL EDWARD P. ASH Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my constituent LTC Edward P. ``Ned'' Ash for his exemplary dedication to duty and service to the U.S. Army and to the United States of America. Lieutenant Colonel Ash will retire this summer after more than two decades in the U.S. Army. Entering the Army from Vancouver, WA, Lieutenant Colonel Ash earned a commission from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point with a degree in international relations and was commissioned an armor officer in 1994. Lieutenant Colonel Ash served in a variety of cavalry units and assignments during his 22 years of service. As a lieutenant, he served as a tank platoon leader, scout platoon leader, troop executive officer, and as a squadron staff officer in the 2nd Squadron, 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment. As a captain from 1999 to 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Ash remained in a hardship assignment with the 2nd Infantry Division for 3 years to serve in Korea. While assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division, he commanded Bravo Troop and Headquarters Troop in the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment. After working at the national training center, where Lieutenant Colonel Ash trained units that were preparing to deploy in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, he was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment. He deployed with this unit to Iraq while serving as the operations officer and then to Afghanistan as the squadron executive officer. Lieutenant Colonel Ash spent his last 4 years in the Army as a budget liaison in the office around the corner from mine in the Russell Senate Office Building and has become a fixture in the Halls of the U.S. Senate. My staff have called on him many times to help with issues affecting the soldiers and military families in Washington State and around the country. Lieutenant Colonel Ash has approached every inquiry from my staff, from requisition requests for tents to detailed questions about national strategy, with the same calm wisdom and thoughtfulness that puts serving people and getting results above all else. Lieutenant Colonel Ash has also led the teams that supported the logistic requirements for the funerals of two of my colleagues who served in the Army: Senator Daniel Inouye and Senator Frank Lautenberg. His efforts during these funerals helped ensure that they were conducted with the dignity befitting the memories of these giants of the Senate. I can confidently say that Lieutenant Colonel Ash's leadership has positively impacted his soldiers, peers, and superiors throughout his career. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending LTC Edward P. Ash for over two decades of service to his country. We wish Ned and his wife, Jamie Skaluba, all the best as they continue their journey of service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1852] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL EDWARD P.

CREC-2016-04-11-pt1-PgS1852,CREC-2016-04-11,114,"200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF KINGFIELD, MAINE","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1852] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF KINGFIELD, MAINE Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the town of Kingfield, ME. Known today as a gateway to the rugged and beautiful Longfellow Mountains, Kingfield was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today. Kingfield's incorporation on January 24, 1816, was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the mountains and river valleys of western Maine were the hunting grounds of the Abenaki Tribe. The reverence the Abenaki had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is upheld by the people of Kingfield today. The town's namesake is a central figure in Maine history. In 1807, merchant and shipbuilder William King and his partners purchased lands in the wilderness and began attracting settlers. In 1820, Maine achieved statehood, and William King, by then a respected statesman and decorated military officer, became its first Governor. The early settlers were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy mills. Roads and a railway were built, and the wealth produced by hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to create a true community. Among the earliest settlers was Salomon Stanley, whose descendants became the business, social, and religious leaders of the town. At the dawn of the 20th century, his twin sons Francis Edgar and Freelan Oscar invented the groundbreaking Stanley Steamer automobile and were renowned violin makers. Along with their sister, Chansonetta, they introduced many technological and artistic advancements to the growing field of photography. The Stanley Museum, located in a beautiful century-old Georgian schoolhouse, celebrates the genius of a remarkable family. When industry in Kingfield began to decline in the 1950s, outdoor recreation rose to prominence, driven by the energy, enthusiasm, and vision of the townspeople. Today skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort, hiking, golf, and snowmobiling, along with some of the most spectacular scenery of the Appalachian Trail, place Kingfield among America's favorite destinations for the outdoor enthusiast. The decision by Nestle's Poland Spring to open a bottling plant in the town is a testament to the region's pristine environment and diversifying economy. From the valiant service of Colonel William King in the War of 1812 to the conflicts of our time, Kingfield is a town of patriots. It is significant that the town's plans for its yearlong bicentennial celebration include enhancements to the memorials honoring Kingfield veterans. Kingfield is also a town of involved citizens. The active historical society, volunteer fire department, and library are evidence of a strong community spirit. The planning and volunteerism that have gone into the bicentennial festivities are evidence that Kingfield's spirit only grows stronger. This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years; it is about human accomplishment and an occasion to celebrate the people who, for more than two centuries, have worked together and cared for one another. Thanks to those who came before, Kingfield has a wonderful past. Thanks to those who are there today, Kingfield has a bright future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S1852] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF KINGFIELD, MAINE Ms. COLLINS.

(2) Some of such individuals are separated from service in the Armed Forces for combat-related injuries (as defined in section 104(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). (3) Congress has recognized the tremendous personal sacrifice of veterans with combat-related injuries by, among other things, specifically excluding from taxable income severance pay received for combat-related injuries. (4) Since 1991, the Secretary of Defense has improperly withheld taxes from severance pay for wounded veterans, thus denying them their due compensation and a significant benefit intended by Congress. (5) Many veterans owed redress are beyond the statutory period to file an amended tax return because they were not or are not aware that taxes were improperly withheld. SEC. __03. RESTORATION OF AMOUNTS IMPROPERLY WITHHELD FOR TAX PURPOSES FROM SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO VETERANS WITH COMBAT-RELATED INJURIES.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commemorate World Health Day. World Health Day is celebrated every year on the founding day of the World Health Organization (``WHO''), which was established in 1950. WHO puts together regional, local, and international events to shed light on a specific world health issue. Under the leadership of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, this year the WHO is focusing efforts and attention to combat the rise in diabetes and improve the lives of those living with this preventable and treatable disease. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body is unable to utilize the insulin produced. We need to focus on increasing preventative healthcare policies in America by providing the public and healthcare providers with innovative prevention strategies. Diabetes can be controlled by increasing access to the following: diagnosis, self-management education, and affordable treatment. In 2008, approximately 347 million people in the world had diabetes. The number of cases have grown exponentially over the years. Eighty percent of approximately 1.5 million deaths, attributed to this disease, occurred in low- and middle-income countries. By 2030, the World Health Organization projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death. We need to acknowledge this as an epidemic and increase awareness towards the staggering burdens/consequences associated with diabetes. I support this World Health Day's 2016 goal to scale up prevention, strengthen care, and enhance surveillance through the launch of the first Global report on diabetes. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E385] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING WORLD HEALTH DAY ______ HON.

PERCY PINKNEY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E386] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR. PERCY PINKNEY ______ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and Congresswoman Karen Bass, to honor the extraordinary life of an outstanding public servant and advocate, Mr. Percy Pinkney. With his passing on Saturday, March 18th, we honor his long, extraordinary life of service and the experiences he shared. A native of McComb, Mississippi, Mr. Pinkney began his adult life as a member of the United States Army. He later received his Bachelor's degree at San Francisco State University, and went on to receive a Master's in Social Work from Lone Mountain College in San Francisco. Mr. Pinkney was an active part of California politics for over 30 years, serving in prestigious positions with many influential leaders. During Governor Jerry Brown's first administration, Percy led his community relations department for seven years, beginning in 1975. In 1992, he joined Senator Dianne Feinstein's staff as a field representative, overseeing issues affecting Los Angeles' Black community. He faithfully served the community until his retirement in 2014. Mr. Pinkney founded the Black American Political Association of California (BAPAC) in 1979. The organization has since become one of the largest political grassroots organizations in the state, with 60 chapters and more than 40,000 active members. Since its founding, BAPAC has continued its mission of developing, documenting, and identifying the resources necessary to achieve cultural, economic, and educational goals of underserved citizens in California. The organization has also played an effective role in increasing African Americans participation in the civic and political process. Overall, Mr. Pinkney's commitment to community building and advancement is unrivaled and BAPAC's leadership has helped countless constituents develop their educational and economic goals. His love for his community and his neighbors will be remembered for years to come, and his achievements in public service have given many Americans the hope and prosperity they deserve.

PERCY PINKNEY ______ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and Congresswoman Karen Bass, to honor the extraordinary life of an outstanding public servant and advocate, Mr. Percy Pinkney. With his passing on Saturday, March 18th, we honor his long, extraordinary life of service and the experiences he shared. A native of McComb, Mississippi, Mr. Pinkney began his adult life as a member of the United States Army. He later received his Bachelor's degree at San Francisco State University, and went on to receive a Master's in Social Work from Lone Mountain College in San Francisco. Mr. Pinkney was an active part of California politics for over 30 years, serving in prestigious positions with many influential leaders. During Governor Jerry Brown's first administration, Percy led his community relations department for seven years, beginning in 1975. In 1992, he joined Senator Dianne Feinstein's staff as a field representative, overseeing issues affecting Los Angeles' Black community. He faithfully served the community until his retirement in 2014. Mr. Pinkney founded the Black American Political Association of California (BAPAC) in 1979. The organization has since become one of the largest political grassroots organizations in the state, with 60 chapters and more than 40,000 active members. Since its founding, BAPAC has continued its mission of developing, documenting, and identifying the resources necessary to achieve cultural, economic, and educational goals of underserved citizens in California. The organization has also played an effective role in increasing African Americans participation in the civic and political process. Overall, Mr. Pinkney's commitment to community building and advancement is unrivaled and BAPAC's leadership has helped countless constituents develop their educational and economic goals. His love for his community and his neighbors will be remembered for years to come, and his achievements in public service have given many Americans the hope and prosperity they deserve.

DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Trey Rice of Grimes, Iowa, as one of Iowa's 2016 Heroes of the Heartland, sponsored by the American Red Cross of Greater Iowa. Each year, the American Red Cross serving greater Iowa honors individuals for their acts of great bravery, dedication and service to the community. The winners are nominated by their peers, highlighting Iowa's most compassionate and caring individuals. These extraordinary people commit actions which demonstrate the potential heroism and kindness which is in all of us. Heroes of the Heartland reflect the values and vision of the American Red Cross, leaving a positive impact on central Iowa. On Sunday July 12, 2015, Trey was floating down the Raccoon River with his cousin and friends. While resting on a sandbar, they heard a young boy yelling, scared and tangled in branches and floating debris. The victim seemed to be struggling to keep his head above the water and he was not wearing a life jacket. Without hesitation, Trey and his cousin jumped into the river, but the current pulled them rapidly downstream. After fighting their way back to shore, Trey again found a familiar place along the river where he knew he could reach the young boy. After jumping into the river for a second time, Trey was able to reach the young boy and pull him to safety. I, too, grew up along this stretch of the Raccoon River and know that while still waters run deep, Iowa's rambling river can turn vicious in a moment's notice. Trey is a hero for all of us who swam the river. Mr. Speaker, Trey is an Iowan who has made central Iowa citizens very proud. He has dedicated his young life to doing what is right and not seeking such attention. But it is with great honor that I recognize him today. I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me in honoring Trey for his courage. I thank him for his service and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E387] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO TREY RICE ______ HON.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Art Ping Lee, who has spent his career advocating on behalf of the overseas Chinese community. Born in Taishan County, Guangdong Province, Mr. Lee immigrated to the United States in 1936. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, only a year after Mr. Lee's arrival in his new home in the District of Columbia, Mr. Lee began national fundraising efforts to support the Chinese army to resist the invasion of Japan. After World War II, Mr. Lee worked tirelessly to assist Chinese families affected by the war. Many Chinese families were kept from being reunited with their loved ones due to U.S. immigration laws and immigration quotas. Mr. Lee was one of the founding members of the National Chinese Welfare Council, in 1957, which campaigned aggressively for lifting of immigration quotas. As a result, 40,000 Chinese immigrants were allowed to enter the U.S. every year. Mr. Lee has also advocated to enhance and strengthen the relationship between the United States and Taiwan. Mr. Lee is a founder of several organizations, including the Chinese Youth Club of Washington, D.C., the Washington, D.C. Lodge of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, and the Lee Federal Credit Union. Mr. Lee, who turns 102 this year, continues to contribute to his community, where he serves as an Honorary Elder of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of Washington, D.C., a Senior Advisor to the Overseas Community Affairs Council of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and an Honorary Elder to The Lee Family Association in the United States. He has received the Hua Kuang Medal, First Class, which is given by Taiwan to Chinese people who have made special contributions in overseas Chinese affairs. Mr. Lee has an impressive record of service and leadership to overseas Chinese communities throughout the United States, particularly in the Washington metropolitan area. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Mr. Lee and his lifetime of service to the Chinese American community in the District of Columbia and for his continued contributions and care for the people he serves. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E387] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ART PING LEE FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHINESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY ______ HON.

After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, only a year after Mr. Lee's arrival in his new home in the District of Columbia, Mr. Lee began national fundraising efforts to support the Chinese army to resist the invasion of Japan. After World War II, Mr. Lee worked tirelessly to assist Chinese families affected by the war. Many Chinese families were kept from being reunited with their loved ones due to U.S. immigration laws and immigration quotas. Mr. Lee was one of the founding members of the National Chinese Welfare Council, in 1957, which campaigned aggressively for lifting of immigration quotas. As a result, 40,000 Chinese immigrants were allowed to enter the U.S. every year. Mr. Lee has also advocated to enhance and strengthen the relationship between the United States and Taiwan. Mr. Lee is a founder of several organizations, including the Chinese Youth Club of Washington, D.C., the Washington, D.C. Lodge of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, and the Lee Federal Credit Union. Mr. Lee, who turns 102 this year, continues to contribute to his community, where he serves as an Honorary Elder of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of Washington, D.C., a Senior Advisor to the Overseas Community Affairs Council of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and an Honorary Elder to The Lee Family Association in the United States. He has received the Hua Kuang Medal, First Class, which is given by Taiwan to Chinese people who have made special contributions in overseas Chinese affairs. Mr. Lee has an impressive record of service and leadership to overseas Chinese communities throughout the United States, particularly in the Washington metropolitan area. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Mr. Lee and his lifetime of service to the Chinese American community in the District of Columbia and for his continued contributions and care for the people he serves. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E387] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ART PING LEE FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHINESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY ______ HON.

CREC-2016-04-11-pt1-PgE387-3,CREC-2016-04-11,114,COMMEMORATING NATIONAL MINORITY HEALTH MONTH,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E387] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING NATIONAL MINORITY HEALTH MONTH ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of April as National Minority Health Month. As a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus and co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues Task Force on Women of Color, I have always believed that access to quality health care should be a universal right of all citizens. National Minority Health Month is a time to reflect and renew our shared dedication and responsibility to eradicating racial disparities in health. Commemorated every year, National Minority Health Month is to heighten public awareness of the importance of minimizing health disparities and improve the health status of minority populations. National Minority Health Month was established 14 years ago when Congress passed H. Con. Res. 388, a concurrent resolution designating April as the month to ``promote educational efforts on the health problems currently facing minorities and other health disparity populations.'' H. Con. Res. 388 encouraged ``all health organizations and Americans to conduct appropriate programs and activities to promote healthfulness in minority and other health disparity communities.'' Mr. Speaker, the differences in places where we live, work, and play frequently result in inequalities in opportunities like quality childcare and education, access to healthy foods, and safe places to be physically active. ``National Minority Cancer Awareness Week'' is observed during the third full week in April and directs attention to the fact that cancer has a disproportionately severe impact on minorities and the economically disadvantaged. The rate of premature death (death before age 75 years) from stroke and coronary heart disease are higher among non-Hispanic blacks than among whites. In 2009, homicide rates were 263 percent higher among males than females and 665 percent higher among non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites. The motor vehicle-related death rate for men is approximately 2.5 times that for women. In addition, the motor vehicle-related death rate for American Indians and Alaska Natives is more than twice as high as for other racial and ethnic groups. Tuberculosis rates declined among all racial and ethnic minority groups and among both U.S. and foreign-born persons from 2006 to 2010. Rates of tuberculosis cases, however, remained persistently higher among racial and ethnic minority groups than among whites in 2010. Obesity rates remain higher among racial minorities than whites. Non-Asian racial/ethnic minorities continue to experience higher rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses than whites. Diabetes prevalence is highest among males, persons aged 65 years and older, non-Hispanic blacks and those of mixed race, Hispanics, persons with less than high school education, those who were poor, and those with a disability. During 2010, approximately 40 percent Hispanic adults and 25 percent of non-Hispanic black adults were classified as uninsured. In my district, two outstanding organizations, African-American Breast Cancer Outreach and Gateway to Care, have dedicated themselves to advocacy efforts for minority health. The African-American Breast Cancer Outreach program received ``models of achievement'' awards from the Center for Research on Minority Health of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Gateway to Care was awarded special recognition for its work to help uninsured and underinsured residents acquire health care. Mr. Speaker, National Minority Health Month serves to remind each and every one of us of the importance of addressing the very real racial and ethnic health disparities that still plague our nation and to recognize and commend those community organizations that do yeoman work in eradicating them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E387] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING NATIONAL MINORITY HEALTH MONTH ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, as a father and a former school teacher I can safely say there is nothing more beautiful, or more fulfilling, than watching a child learn and grow. Schools that cultivate that growth, and allow their students to reach above and beyond their potential are an incredible asset to any community, and for 15 years the LearningSpring School in New York City has done exactly that. The story of LearningSpring, or LSS as it is commonly known, is as special and unique as the population it serves. In the fall of 2000, a group of parents were faced with finding appropriate placements for their children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Disappointed with the options presented to them, these parents decided to create their own school, one that would address all of their children's academic, social, emotional, and therapeutic needs. Their school would also be designed to incorporate the families of the children as an important partner in the education of their child. The parents determined they needed to start a foundation, not just a school, to achieve all they had set out to achieve, and in the fall of 2001, the LearningSpring Foundation opened its first program, the LearningSpring Elementary School. Fifteen years later, LearningSpring has flourished into one of the top schools in the city. The LSS model celebrates the fact that the children in the program are bright, but in need of an educational environment that isn't exclusively focused on academic performance. This holistic approach to education is one of the reasons LSS has been a tremendous success, helping hundreds of graduates with ASD prepare to live wonderful, happy, and independent lives. I have personally seen all of the wonderful work LSS does, and I have always been incredibly impressed with their approach to education. This year, LSS is celebrating their 15th Anniversary at their LearningSpring Blossoms celebration, honoring their 2002 Seedling Trustees. I want to congratulate those honorees and the entire LearningSpring community on the occasion. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E388] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING LEARNINGSPRING SCHOOL ______ HON.

PAUL F. WOXLAND ______ HON. KEITH ELLISON of minnesota in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Paul F. Woxland, and to recognize the nearly twenty-five years of service that he has given to our region as well as to the federal government in his work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Woxland began his service with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1991, where he assumed a position as Director of the Minneapolis Multifamily Asset Management Division and Satellite Office Coordinator. In this role, Mr. Woxland was tasked with the ultimate responsibility for physical, managerial, and financial condition of every HUD property within the region. Mr. Woxland has also been instrumental in the development and improvement of housing in Minnesota and in our neighboring state of Wisconsin. In this capacity, he has overseen thousands of housing developments, working diligently to provide all families with access to one of our most basic yet most needed resources, a safe space to call home. To that end, Mr. Woxland has had a direct hand in over one thousand affordable housing projects in Minnesota, and over eight hundred projects in Wisconsin. This staggering number of developments has had an immeasurable impact upon the health of the region, and in partnership has provided permanent housing to over fifteen thousand households. Mr. Woxland's work with the Interagency Stabilization Group has shown the true level of his commitment to providing housing for very low income residents. Mr. Woxland, through this collaborative organization, has succeeded in not only preserving but stabilizing affordable housing in Minneapolis for thousands of low-income residents. Some notable developments this partnership has preserved are Ebenezer Tower, Cecil Newman Plaza, and Riverside Plaza, a local landmark that is honored in the National Register of Historic Places. To his colleagues and staff, he is regarded as the leader of one of the most effective and efficient HUD offices in the nation. Mr. Woxland leaves a legacy at HUD of tireless commitment and of service to our most underprivileged. For that he deserves our gratitude. He also leaves a legacy of touching countless lives and fostering inclusive communities throughout the region. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E388] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation's women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Dolores Diaz- Carrey, of Pasadena, California. Born in Los Angeles, Dolores attended Sacred Heart Elementary School and Sacred Heart High School. She received her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Spanish Literature from Holy Names University and her Master's Degree in Education from the University of Southern California. In addition, Dolores obtained a Counseling Credential from the University of California, Los Angeles and an Administrative Credential from California State University, Los Angeles. A consummate educator, Ms. Diaz-Carrey's long career in education began as a teacher at the elementary and junior high school levels in Northern California, after which she moved to Mexico City to teach. In 1969, Dolores joined the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) where she worked for 35 years. In LAUSD's Division of Adult and Career Education, she worked in many capacities, including as an ESL (English as a Second Language) instructor, teacher advisor, counselor, assistant principal, and principal. From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Diaz-Carrey was Executive Producer of the first bilingual ESL television series for adults, ``POCHTLAN"", for which she was awarded an Emmy from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. From 1987 to 1998, she was Principal of Garfield Community Adult School and while there, founded a family literacy program for adults and their children. In 1998, Dolores became Director of the Adult Instructional Services Unit where she was responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of all the curricula for adults, including ESL, high school diploma, basic education, parenting, and nursing programs--during this time, she was also Program Director of the Community Based English Tutoring program. Dolores is a longtime member of the East Los Angeles Rotary Club, where she serves as the Rotarian advisor for a youth club, and is the incoming club president. In 2011, she received the Rotarian Foundation District Service Award. Dolores is a member and past President of the San Rafael Library Associates, a support group for the San Rafael Library in Pasadena, and is a generous supporter of the arts, including the Los Angeles Music and Art School, and the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles. A forty-year resident of Pasadena, Dolores enjoys traveling, daily walks with her dog, Dodger, long-distance cycling, and attending Los Angeles Philharmonic concerts and events at the Hollywood Bowl. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California's 28th Congressional District, Dolores Diaz-Carrey, for her extraordinary service to the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E388] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DOLORES DIAZ-CARREY--28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding constituent and renowned neuroscientist, Dr. Samuel M. Young, Jr. of Jupiter, Florida. Growing up in Caldwell, New Jersey, Sam ``Stump'' Young's strength on the High School football field led him to Princeton University, where he discovered a passion for scientific research that would last a lifetime. Sam chose to major in molecular biology at Princeton, an unlikely choice for the Princeton Tigers' star defensive tackle and one who challenged the assumptions of his professors and fellow students. As a postgraduate, Dr. Young studied at some of the leading laboratories in Germany and the United States before joining the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience in Jupiter in 2010, where he currently serves as Research Group Leader in Molecular Mechanisms of Synaptic Function. At Max Planck, Dr. Young and his team use innovative techniques to create models of how synapses function, and their path- breaking research helps shed light on the causes of brain disease. On Sunday, April 3rd, I was honored to have Dr. Young deliver the keynote address at a ceremony I hosted to recognize 65 local students and recipients of this year's Congressional Award, the United States Congress' award for young Americans who have demonstrated outstanding achievements in four areas: volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/exploration. These young men and women exemplify the best values of hard work, determination, passion, and leadership, and I thank Dr. Young for sharing his story with them. I know that by following his example and pursuing their own passions--no matter what--they too will achieve incredible successes in life. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E389] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING SAMUEL M.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest appreciation for the life, legacy, and actions of the late Cesar Estrada Chavez. The changes that Cesar Chavez fought for throughout his life have dramatically changed the way that farm workers are treated in our country. Cesar Chavez was one of the nation's greatest civil rights activists and the tireless champion of migrant farm workers fighting for humane working conditions. As a young man Cesar Chavez worked in the fields where he saw firsthand the dangerous conditions which farm workers were forced to endure. In 1952 he became an organizer for the Community Service Organization (CSO), a Latino civil rights group, and eventually became the national director of the organization. In 1965, Chavez co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with Dolores Huerta which evolved into the United Farm Workers union. The National Farm Workers Association was successful in securing fair wages and safe working conditions for farm workers. The UFW also led a worldwide grape boycott that helped ensure farm workers had a voice in contract negotiations. Cesar Chavez is also known for his fasts which he used as a nonviolent method of promoting his beliefs. In 1972, Chavez fasted in response to Arizona's passage of legislation that prohibited boycotts and strikes by farm workers during the harvest season. Cesar Chavez achieved unprecedented gains for farmworkers. His influence also exceeded to empowering the people to strive for their own rights. Numerous other social movements utilized his tactics in their own work. On April 23, 1993 Cesar Chavez died, bringing great sadness to the farm workers community that he spent his life fighting for. With his death also came a great sense of pride for all the progress that Cesar Chavez brought as a direct result of his unwavering commitment to farm workers' rights. I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating Cesar Estrada Chavez's life and legacy. America is a better place because of Cesar Chavez. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E389] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING CESAR CHAVEZ DAY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my constituent, Colonel Ferdinand Clarence ``Fred'' Bidgood, a retired United States Army officer, a patriot, and a true leader. After his birth in 1938 in Fort Benning, Georgia, Fred went on to live in London, England, where he graduated from Central High School in 1955. He matriculated into the United States Military Academy's Class of 1960 where he received a Bachelor of Science degree. Fred later earned a Master's degree in civil engineering from Texas A&M, and graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College. Following his graduation from the United States Military Academy, Fred was commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant in the Army and served around the world in command and staff positions in both Artillery and Engineer units. Throughout his career, he served as Associate Executive Director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America in Washington, DC and Chief of Staff for the National Victory Celebration, where his duties included welcoming home troops from the Gulf War. He also served as Director on the Board of Governors of the World United Services Organization and Chairman of their Human Resources Committee, and he was a member of the Board of Advisers of National Handicapped Sports. Fred lived much of his life in South Run Forest community in Springfield, Virginia. On Veterans Day, Flag Day, and Memorial Day, Fred enjoyed distributing flags across his entire community to share his patriotic spirit with his neighbors in honor of our country and all those who have served it bravely with him. Fred will be remembered dearly across the South Run Forest community by all those he touched on a daily basis. He was well known by many of his neighbors for having a witty sense of humor. One of Fred's neighbors, Norman Bayne, once told me about a time when he was mowing his lawn and wearing shorts, Fred came out and shouted, ``If I had legs like that I would wear pants.'' Fred always had a way to brighten the day of those around him. Fred's final assignment in the military was as an Executive Assistant to the Administrator of the Veterans Administration. He passed away a decorated veteran, having earned four awards of the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, two awards of the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, and the Army Commendation Medal. He was preceded in death by his daughter Kerri. He is survived by his wife Marilyn of 55 years, two sons Mark and Matthew, and four grandchildren, Damon, Haley, Aidan, and Brianna. I am honored to commemorate Fred today for his life of leadership, service, and selfless contributions to our great nation. We are fortunate to have citizens like Fred who are willing to put their life at risk to serve the United States of America. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E389] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF COLONEL FERDINAND CLARENCE ``FRED'' BIDGOOD ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Meredith Wilharber of Urbandale, Iowa as one of Iowa's 2016 Heroes of the Heartland, sponsored by the American Red Cross of Greater Iowa. Each year, the American Red Cross serving greater Iowa honors individuals for their acts [[Page E390]] of great bravery, dedication and service to the community. The winners are nominated by their peers, highlighting Iowa's most compassionate and caring individuals. These extraordinary people commit actions which demonstrate the potential heroism and kindness which is in all of us. Heroes of the Heartland reflect the values and vision of the American Red Cross, leaving a positive impact on central Iowa. Meredith knows first-hand about Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) because it took her mother's life when she was young. At 34, Meredith was diagnosed with the same incurable disease. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension or PAH is a chronic and deadly combination heart and lung disease where the pulmonary artery causes the heart and lungs to become strained. It is less often that I meet a hero face to face but I have had the honor and privilege of visiting with Meredith and her husband, Randy who founded the Blue Lips Foundation with the goal of changing how and when PAH is diagnosed through awareness and education, as well as funding research and the development of diagnostic tools. They are warriors for a just cause. Mr. Speaker, Meredith is an Iowan who has made central Iowa citizens very proud. She has dedicated her life, doing what is right and not seeking much attention. But it is with great honor that I recognize her today. I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me in honoring Meredith for her courage. I thank her for her service and wish her continued success in all her future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E389-E390] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MEREDITH WILHARBER ______ HON.

THEODORE E. DEUTCH of florida in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to observe Equal Pay Day, the day when women's wages finally catch up to men's. Fifty three years after passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, women and minorities continue to experience inequitable pay differentials. In fact, women who work full time, year round in the United States were paid only 79 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts in 2014. In Florida, a woman who holds a full-time job is paid, on average, $34,768 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $40,971 per year. For minorities, the gap is even larger. This equates to a combined 17 billion dollars loss of wages annually for Florida women with full-time jobs. These lost wages mean Floridian families have fewer resources to buy goods and services. The wage gap directly hurts Florida's families and our economy. If change continues at the same slow pace as it has during the last 50 years, it will take nearly 50 more years--until 2059--for women and men to finally reach pay parity. I join the Enterprising and Professional Women of South Florida in observing Equal Pay Day and calling attention to the continuing wage disparity women in our nation and state face. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E390] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OBSERVING EQUAL PAY DAY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating Dean Claudio Grossman and his 21-year tenure at American University's Washington College of Law (WCL). As WCL's first Latino dean, and lifelong advocate for human rights, he brought his unparalleled commitment to diversity and support for students of color. Dean Grossman, a native of Chile, spent many years in political exile in Europe after serving in the administration of democratically-elected President Salvador Allende, before finally coming to the United States. His legal scholarship is focused on international human rights and he has served in several roles within the United Nations, most notably in the United Nation's Committee Against Torture, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Dean Grossman has also served as the chair of the United Nations Human Rights Treaty Bodies and board member of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights. He is one of the few Latino law school deans in the country, and the first to serve in that capacity at WCL. He will be succeeded by Camille Nelson, the first black dean at WCL and the first woman in that role in the last 60 years. He leaves large shoes to fill. As dean, he has made great contributions to the legal profession through his work expanding WCL's LL.M. program, semester abroad programs, and clinical programs that advocate for immigrants and the disabled. He has also presided over WCL's new Tenley Campus expansion. Previous honors for Dean Grossman's work on human rights and international law include the Rene Cassin Award from B'nai B'rith International in Chile and the Harry LeRoy Jones Award from the Washington Foreign Law Society. Since becoming dean of WLC, Dean Grossman has received a host of honors, including: Outstanding Dean of the Year by the National Association of Public Interest Law (now known as Equal Justice Works) in 2000, the Inter American Press Association's Chapultepec Grand Prize 2002 for his achievements in the field of human rights, the Charles Norberg International Lawyer of the Year Award from the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Inter-American Bar Association, the Lifetime Leadership Award from the Hispanic National Bar Foundation, and the Leadership Award from the Maryland Hispanic Bar Association. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Dean Claudio Grossman's remarkable efforts across his 21- year tenure at WCL. Dean Grossman has dedicated his life to human rights and international law, serving as an exemplary leader.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Bronx leader who has been a friend and partner to me in the Co-op City community for many years, the incomparable Shirley Saunders. I have been friends with Shirley ever since we attended Evander Childs High School together, and I have always known her to be a tremendous force for good in the neighborhood. Shirley was born and raised in the Lincoln Projects in Harlem. She is a product of the New York City public school system, including my alma maters, Hunter and Lehman Colleges. For 30 years, Shirley has lived in Co-op City and been actively involved in the management of the largest co-operative housing development in the world. She was elected and held a seat as a member and secretary of the Riverbay Board of Directors, which governs Co-op City, and served in those roles for more than 12 years. Shirley has also been actively involved in other community and civic organizations, including the Parents Association for P.S. 153, for which she served as president; the Sister to Sister program; the local Boy and Girl Scouts chapters; the local little league programs; and is a founding mother of the Jack & Jill of America Bronx chapter. In fact, Shirley was such an integral part of the community, I had to make her a part of my Congressional Staff. She served as Senior Staff Assistant with me for over 20 years, and was extraordinary in that role. But for all of her incredible service to the public, it was always family that was Shirley's true passion. She has been married to her husband, Rod, for more than 40 years, and together they have three wonderful children and two beautiful grandchildren. This year, Shirley is celebrating her 69th birthday. On the occasion I want to thank her for years of friendship, and wish her nothing but the best.

DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Carl Burt of Des Moines, Iowa, as one of Iowa's 2016 Heroes of the Heartland, sponsored by the American Red Cross of Greater Iowa. Each year, the American Red Cross serving greater Iowa honors individuals for their acts of great bravery, dedication and service to the community. The winners are nominated by their peers, highlighting Iowa's most compassionate and caring individuals. These extraordinary people commit actions which demonstrate the potential heroism and kindness which is in all of us. Heroes of the Heartland reflect the values and vision of the American Red Cross, leaving a positive impact on central Iowa. In announcing the Award, Red Cross officials explained why Mr. Burt is being recognized for his heroism. Last spring, he was having an outdoor dinner with a friend and her mother when the friend noticed her mother slouched back in her chair, barely breathing. Mr. Burt immediately took action and attempted to begin cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) but her jaw was clenched. He told his friend to call 9-1-1 emergency while he continued giving rescue breaths. Mr. Burt started doing chest compressions and after only two compressions, the mother suddenly awakened. Emergency services arrived, checked her vitals and determined that she had had a seizure but would recover. As part of his daily role as a jail service aide for Polk County, Iowa, Mr. Burt is required to be certified in CPR. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Burt is an Iowan who has made central Iowa citizens very proud. He has dedicated his life to quietly doing what is right and not seeking such attention. But it is with great honor that I recognize him today. I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me in honoring Mr. Burt for his courage. I thank him for his service and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E391] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CARL BURT ______ HON.

CREC-2016-04-11-pt1-PgE391-2,CREC-2016-04-11,114,COMMEMORATING APRIL AS NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E391] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING APRIL AS NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of April as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I have always believed that our children are our nation's greatest strength and resource. National Child Abuse Prevention Month is remembered as a time to reflect and renew our shared dedication and responsibility to protect every child in our country, no matter their social or economic background. As elected officials, we have an obligation to condemn this violence, work for stronger enforcement of the law and provide adequate funding for programs to assist children who may have experienced such abuse. There is no crime greater that an individual can commit than the crimes of child abuse, in all of its forms. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) established the first federal child protection legislation, and was signed into law by President Nixon on January 31, 1974. This marked the new precedent for the national response to child abuse and neglect. Then in 1983, President Reagan proclaimed the month of April as National Child Abuse Prevention month. In 1989, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect awarded nine grants to assist in developing and implementing community-based prevention strategies, in furtherance of that cause. In addition, these grants assisted in developing a coordinated multidisciplinary training program for professionals and community leaders to improve public awareness campaigns, and implement crisis intervention programs. In 1996, under the Clinton Administration's emphasis on collaboration and integration among child and family serving systems, a new grants program called the Community-Based Family Resource and Support (CBFRS), was created. These grants reflected the belief that public and private child abuse prevention and treatment programs must work together toward common goals. In 2005, there was a renewed commitment to make child abuse prevention a national priority. As a result, the Children's Bureau focused on making safe children and healthy families a new priority, a theme that was also adopted by the National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect. Mr. Speaker, children were not forgotten during the great debate over the Patient Protection Affordability Care Act, which included key provisions that created the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. Thus far during my time in Congress, I have continually proposed amendments aimed to assist families and children across the nation. My amendment to HR 3700, which was passed in this chamber, directed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Labor to work together to produce an annual report on inter-agency strategies. These strategies would strengthen family economic empowerment by linking housing with essential supportive services, such as employment counseling and training, financial growth, childcare, transportation, meals, youth recreational activities and other responsive services. Once again, I thank my colleagues in the House for their efforts in protecting the children of this nation. Mr. Speaker, this important month serves to remind each and every one of us, that as Americans we have a solemn responsibility to educate, feed, and protect our children at all costs. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E391] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING APRIL AS NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, this important month serves to remind each and every one of us, that as Americans we have a solemn responsibility to educate, feed, and protect our children at all costs. ____________________",package_114_161.csv,3721,3721,3788,"[congressional record volume 162, number 54 (monday, april 11, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [page e391] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] commemorating april as national child abuse prevention month ______ hon. sheila jackson lee of texas in the house of representatives monday, april 11, 2016 ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise to recognize the importance of april as national child abuse prevention month. as co-chair of the congressional children's caucus, i have always believed that our children are our nation's greatest strength and resource. national child abuse prevention month is remembered as a time to reflect and renew our shared dedication and responsibility to protect every child in our country, no matter their social or economic background. as elected officials, we have an obligation to condemn this violence, work for stronger enforcement of the law and provide adequate funding for programs to assist children who may have experienced such abuse. there is no crime greater that an individual can commit than the crimes of child abuse, in all of its forms. the child abuse prevention and treatment act (capta) established the first federal child protection legislation, and was signed into law by president nixon on january 31, 1974. this marked the new precedent for the national response to child abuse and neglect. then in 1983, president reagan proclaimed the month of april as national child abuse prevention month. in 1989, the national center on child abuse and neglect awarded nine grants to assist in developing and implementing community-based prevention strategies, in furtherance of that cause. in addition, these grants assisted in developing a coordinated multidisciplinary training program for professionals and community leaders to improve public awareness campaigns, and implement crisis intervention programs. in 1996, under the clinton administration's emphasis on collaboration and integration among child and family serving systems, a new grants program called the community-based family resource and support (cbfrs), was created. these grants reflected the belief that public and private child abuse prevention and treatment programs must work together toward common goals. in 2005, there was a renewed commitment to make child abuse prevention a national priority. as a result, the children's bureau focused on making safe children and healthy families a new priority, a theme that was also adopted by the national conference on child abuse and neglect. mr. speaker, children were not forgotten during the great debate over the patient protection affordability care act, which included key provisions that created the maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting program. thus far during my time in congress, i have continually proposed amendments aimed to assist families and children across the nation. my amendment to hr 3700, which was passed in this chamber, directed the secretary of housing and urban development and the secretary of labor to work together to produce an annual report on inter-agency strategies. these strategies would strengthen family economic empowerment by linking housing with essential supportive services, such as employment counseling and training, financial growth, childcare, transportation, meals, youth recreational activities and other responsive services. once again, i thank my colleagues in the house for their efforts in protecting the children of this nation. mr. speaker, this important month serves to remind each and every one of us, that as americans we have a solemn responsibility to educate, feed, and protect our children at all costs. ____________________",3721

DeCOUDREAUX ______ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary career of Mrs. Alecia A. DeCoudreaux. Mrs. DeCoudreaux serves as the President of Mills College, my Alma Mater, and will be stepping down to conclude a successful tenure in academia. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Mrs. DeCoudreaux began her academic career as a student of English and Political Science at Wellesley College in 1976. After receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree, Mrs. DeCoudreaux continued her education and received a Doctor of Laws degree from the Indiana University School of Law in 1978. While at Mills, Mrs. DeCoudreaux furthered inclusion by instituting the first women's college policy for admitting transgender students. This policy has become a model for women's colleges across the nation. She also expanded Mills' global focus and reach by participating in the U.S. Department of State's Women in Public Service Project (WPSP), hosting 25 women delegates from 22 countries in a 10-day conference focusing on women solving the climate crisis. Mrs. DeCoudreaux led the campus community and collaborated with the school's board of trustees to find solutions to tough economic circumstances. Many educational programs have suffered similar downturns, and Mrs. DeCoudreaux's commitment to higher education succeeded in sustaining Mills College. In January 2016, Mrs. DeCoudreaux joined 11 other Northern California colleges and universities in signing the Oakland Promise College Pathway Partnership, which offers financial aid and mentoring support to Oakland high school graduates. These graduates learned the skills necessary to continue a path in academics and further their careers. Her many accolades portray Mrs. DeCoudreaux as a tireless advocate for access to education, including the Award for Education from the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the ABC 7 News Profiles of Excellence Award; the Madam C.J. Walker Pioneer Award; and recognition as a Leadership California Trailblazer. She was selected as one of San Francisco Business Times' Most Influential Women in Business, and she was included in Diverse Issues in Higher Education magazine's 30 Women Making a Difference feature. On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, Mrs. Alecia A. DeCoudreaux, I salute you.

He moved to Los Angeles in early adulthood to work with Van Vorse Mattress Company and later became a successful entrepreneur. He was devoted to his family and to his community. He married the late Barbara Talley and they had three sons. He also had a daughter. He raised his family in the Vermont Knolls neighborhood of South Los Angeles, where he quickly took on positions of leadership. He served as President of the Vermont Knolls--81st Street Block Club many times over the course of nearly five decades. He worked to build partnerships that would contribute to improving the area, including with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the city council office, and later with the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (CoCo). I came to know him as he took active roles in CoCo programs such as the Greater Resources through Organizing and Work (GROW) Project.

He also fought to beautify the area and calm traffic, making it nicer and safer to walk in the neighborhood. As a result of his efforts he was selected to take part in the Neighborhood Leadership Program of the prestigious Coro Southern California Leadership Center, further enhancing his skills. He was also chosen to sit on the LAPD Community Police Advisory Board and was recognized repeatedly by LAPD for his work to improve safety and solve problems. Never afraid to put in hard work, Mr. Koonce would not settle for less than he thought his community deserved. He will be deeply missed, and my heart is with his family and friends as they gather to honor his memory. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E391-E392] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ON THE PASSING OF LAWRENCE D.

CHARLES W. DENT of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to bring to the House's attention the 150th Anniversary of ESSROC Cement, a company deeply rooted in the foundation of Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. In 1866, David O. Saylor, a resident of Allentown, purchased 30 acres of property in Coplay, PA. He, along with Esias Rehrig and Adam Woolever, chartered the Coplay Cement Company. Saylor, an innovator, developed a process that allowed Portland type cement to be made in the United States. Saylor patented the process, and by 1900, Coplay Cement was providing over 70 percent of the Portland Cement used in America. Coplay Cement provided the material that became the building blocks of the massive infrastructure expansion and city-building that occurred in post-Civil War America. Paris-based Ciments Francais ultimately acquired Coplay Cement in 1976. The 1990s were a time of great activity for the company. It adopted the ESSROC name in 1990. In 1992, Italcementi became ESSROC's parent company. Now, 150 years later, ESSROC has operations across four continents. In North America, the Nazareth-based company has the ability to produce over 6.5 million metric tons of cement annually. To this day, Saylor Cement remains one of their main product lines. ESSROC has demonstrated itself as an impressive business, based not only on its corporate metrics, but more importantly on its commitment to the greater Lehigh Valley. ESSROC is a valued manufacturer in our community, a provider of good jobs with good wages, and a respected corporate citizen. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to offer my congratulations to the men and women who work at ESSROC both in the Lehigh Valley area and across the United States. May they enjoy continued prosperity. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E392] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ESSROC CEMENT ______ HON.

CHARLES W. DENT of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to bring to the House's attention the 150th Anniversary of ESSROC Cement, a company deeply rooted in the foundation of Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. In 1866, David O. Saylor, a resident of Allentown, purchased 30 acres of property in Coplay, PA. He, along with Esias Rehrig and Adam Woolever, chartered the Coplay Cement Company. Saylor, an innovator, developed a process that allowed Portland type cement to be made in the United States. Saylor patented the process, and by 1900, Coplay Cement was providing over 70 percent of the Portland Cement used in America. Coplay Cement provided the material that became the building blocks of the massive infrastructure expansion and city-building that occurred in post-Civil War America. Paris-based Ciments Francais ultimately acquired Coplay Cement in 1976. The 1990s were a time of great activity for the company. It adopted the ESSROC name in 1990. In 1992, Italcementi became ESSROC's parent company. Now, 150 years later, ESSROC has operations across four continents. In North America, the Nazareth-based company has the ability to produce over 6.5 million metric tons of cement annually. To this day, Saylor Cement remains one of their main product lines. ESSROC has demonstrated itself as an impressive business, based not only on its corporate metrics, but more importantly on its commitment to the greater Lehigh Valley.

From there he came to Iowa, serving in the 132nd Combat Support Squadron at the Iowa Air National Guard Base in Des Moines. His first overseas deployment was during Operation Provide Comfort, where he was stationed at the Air Base Wing of Incirlik Air Base, Adana, Turkey. MSgt Hayworth returned to the United States where he served in various roles until his next deployment overseas in 2009, supporting the 432nd Maintenance Group and our military efforts from the Joint Base Balad in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He later returned to Iowa, completing his career with the Iowa Air National Guard. Mr. Speaker, MSgt Hayworth's unyielding commitment to his country is a true testament to his patriotism.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the passage of the empowering ``Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.'' Over the past three decades, the average tuition at a public, four- year college institution has more than tripled, while the typical family's income has become plateaued. This great struggle pitting the interests of the banks and financial institutions against those of vulnerable students finally came to an end on March 30, 2010, when President Barack Obama signed this legislation into law. This law reinvested savings back into education by upgrading community colleges facilities, increasing Pell Grants, and making it easier for responsible students to pay off their loans. Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions in this nation were resultantly able to receive a needed benefit. For new borrowers after 2014, student loans are eligible to be forgiven after 20 years to those making timely payments, down from the previous 25 year requirement. This law also has helped parents invest in their children's education by simplifying the federal education loan borrowing process. Specifically, in my home city of Houston, Texas, this legislation has helped many of the 9,700 students currently attending the prestigious HBCU, Texas Southern University, alongside the 42,704 students attending the University of Houston. During my time serving our country, I have fought to make higher education accessible to all who strive to achieve it. That is why I am proud to have stood with 220 of my colleagues in voting ``yea'' in support of this legislation. [[Page E393]] Mr. Speaker, this Act has spurred a movement by President Obama to help every American achieve the dream of being able to attend college no matter their financial background. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E392-E393] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE PASSAGE OF THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT ______ HON.

CHRISTOPHER P. GIBSON of new york in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Janet Mahoney for her accomplishments in over twenty years of service to The American Legion Auxiliary, Montgomery Unit No. 429 in Rhinebeck, NY. Janet is a recently retired dental hygienist, proud grandmother of eight grandchildren and also the widow of a Vietnam Veteran. She has always been passionate about Veterans, their families, and their communities. Throughout her selfless and tireless service in the American Legion Auxiliary, Janet has served on multiple committees and in many leadership positions at the local and state levels. Some of her positions include: three terms as Unit President, three terms as County President, and two terms each as District Vice President and District President. Janet has served at the State level since 2007 as the Education Chairman, Public Relations Chairman, Americanism Chairman, Vice- President and President. During her tenure of outstanding service at the State level, she was instrumental in the organization winning national awards for Department of New York Press Book, Best Overall Department Public Relations Program, The National Americanism Award, The National Children and Youth Award, and The National Veterans Affairs & Rehabilitation Award. In Janet's current capacity as New York American Legion Auxiliary President, she oversees multiple programs aimed at assisting Veterans as well as the communities of New York. One of her main priorities as President is raising money to support Vietnam Veterans impacted by Agent Orange. Janet is leading a statewide campaign, covering all 62 counties across New York, and has a goal to raise over $75,000.00. All funds raised in support of ``Changing the Legacy of Agent Orange'' will support Veterans with documented Agent Orange related medical needs. Funds will also support these Veteran's children with documented Agent Orange related medical needs. Mr. Speaker, Janet Mahoney has distinguished herself throughout her remarkable twenty plus year career in the New York American Legion Auxiliary where she has been an unwavering advocate for our Veterans, their families, and our communities. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating her on her countless achievements during a remarkable career. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E393] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JANET MAHONEY ______ HON.

Janet is a recently retired dental hygienist, proud grandmother of eight grandchildren and also the widow of a Vietnam Veteran. She has always been passionate about Veterans, their families, and their communities. Throughout her selfless and tireless service in the American Legion Auxiliary, Janet has served on multiple committees and in many leadership positions at the local and state levels. Some of her positions include: three terms as Unit President, three terms as County President, and two terms each as District Vice President and District President. Janet has served at the State level since 2007 as the Education Chairman, Public Relations Chairman, Americanism Chairman, Vice- President and President. During her tenure of outstanding service at the State level, she was instrumental in the organization winning national awards for Department of New York Press Book, Best Overall Department Public Relations Program, The National Americanism Award, The National Children and Youth Award, and The National Veterans Affairs & Rehabilitation Award. In Janet's current capacity as New York American Legion Auxiliary President, she oversees multiple programs aimed at assisting Veterans as well as the communities of New York. One of her main priorities as President is raising money to support Vietnam Veterans impacted by Agent Orange. Janet is leading a statewide campaign, covering all 62 counties across New York, and has a goal to raise over $75,000.00. All funds raised in support of ``Changing the Legacy of Agent Orange'' will support Veterans with documented Agent Orange related medical needs. Funds will also support these Veteran's children with documented Agent Orange related medical needs. Mr. Speaker, Janet Mahoney has distinguished herself throughout her remarkable twenty plus year career in the New York American Legion Auxiliary where she has been an unwavering advocate for our Veterans, their families, and our communities. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating her on her countless achievements during a remarkable career. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E393] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JANET MAHONEY ______ HON.

DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016- Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Jeffrey Walton of Boy Scout Troop 104 in Corning, Iowa for achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. The Eagle Scout rank is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Only about five percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained for more than a century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit the community. Jeffrey's Eagle Scout project involved constructing a large sign to be placed in the yard at Country Haven, a residential care facility, making it easier for people to locate the facility. The work ethic Jeffrey has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading up to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication and perseverance. I am honored to represent Jeffrey and his family in the United States Congress. I ask that all of my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating him on reaching the rank of Eagle Scout and in wishing him nothing but continued success in his future education and career. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E393] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT JEFFREY WALTON ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a woman who is tenderly known as ``Mama Sarah'' within her community: Mrs. Sarah Pauline Turner. Sarah turned 100 years old on April 2nd, 2016, and I am so grateful to be able to help celebrate her reaching that remarkable milestone by honoring her in the hallowed halls of Congress. Sarah is a treasured member of her community whose love for people became self-evident early on in her life when, after completing her education, she worked for the Veteran Admission in Washington, D.C. She later moved to New York City and became a friend to everyone she has met in the Bronx. Sarah's list of community service accomplishments is long and distinguished. She has received an impressive amount of awards and recognition from her community, including for some of her most important work with RAIN Eastchester Senior Center and Eastchester Housing. As involved as she is with her community, Sarah is just as involved with her church. She has offered spiritual guidance to the members of Burke Avenue Baptist Church for over 50 years, and has also served as part of the Pastor's Aide Ministry, Gospel Chorus, Senior Usher Board, and is currently President of Willing Workers Ministry. Sarah's unwavering dedication to her church community has not gone unnoticed. She gained a lifetime membership of the Eastern Stars Organization, where she serves as Worthy Matron. There is no doubt that Sarah is an outstanding citizen of the Bronx Borough. She has been a pillar of her community, who has gracefully bestowed joy and happiness upon everyone she has met. I want to congratulate Sarah on reaching this remarkable milestone, and as Congressman for the northeast Bronx, thank her for all she has done in the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E393] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SARAH TURNER ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Patty Duke, an American icon and advocate for those suffering in silence from various forms of mental illness, who passed away on March 29, 2016 at the age of 69. Patty Duke was born Anna Marie Duke on December 14, 1946 in Elmhurst, New York. Anna Duke and her siblings grew up in a difficult household, raised by an alcoholic father and a mother who suffered from what was then called ``manic depression,'' later known to be bipolar disorder. Anna Duke was introduced to acting by her brother's managers, John and Ethel Ross, who changed her name to Patty and eventually became her guardians. Later in Patty Duke's life, she revealed that she was a survivor of sexual assault. In 1959, Patty Duke's first big role came when she was cast as Helen Keller in the Broadway version of The Miracle Worker, with Anne Bancroft portraying her teacher, Anne Sullivan. Then in 1962, that play was turned into a feature film, in which she also starred. For her performance in the film, the 16-year-old won a ``Promising Newcomer'' Golden Globe as well as an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress--making her the youngest person to win an Oscar at that time. Sadly, following her Oscar win, Patty Duke began to privately unravel. The abuse she endured along with her family's history of bipolar disorder began to plague her. All the while, she continued to dazzle the outside world with a successful career. Patty Duke then starred in her own sitcom called The Patty Duke Show, which she artfully played two cousin characters simultaneously. In 1965, she also became a pop music contender with her top 10 hit ``Don't Just Stand There'' and headlined the acclaimed film Billie, which was the first movie ever sold to a television network. Thus, began Patty Duke's reign as the ``Queen of TV Movies.'' Patty Duke continued her big-screen career by starring in the cult classic Valley of The Dolls in 1967 and indie films such as Me, Natalie in 1969. Patty Duke married assistant director Harry Falk, remaining in the marriage from 1965 to 1969. After her marriage ended, Patty Duke bore a son named Sean Patrick Duke. In 1972, she married actor John Astin, who played Gomez in the television version of The Addams Family. John Astin adopted her son Sean, and fathered her second son, Mackenzie Astin, born in 1973. Then in 1976, Patty Duke won her second Emmy for the highly successful mini-series Captains and the Kings. Other popular TV movies followed, including the 1979 small screen version of The Miracle Worker, in which she portrayed Anne Sullivan, a role that won her third Emmy. In the mid-1980s, she became president of the Screen Actors Guild. Her 1987 autobiography, Call Me Anna, was made into a TV movie in 1990 in which she portrayed herself and served as co-producer. Following in 1992 second book, A Brilliant Madness: Living With Manic Depression Illness, was published. With the help of family and friends Patty Duke was able to quiet her personal demons, and become a vocal advocate for those suffering from mental illnesses, along with dispelling social stigmas attached to them. Patty Duke died on March 29, 2016 in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, at the age of 69 from a sepsis infection from a ruptured intestine. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to take a moment of silence in remembrance of this strong woman who was able to stand against the suffocating struggles of depression and became a source of inspiration for hundreds of thousands of Americans struggling with mental illnesses. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E394] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PATTY DUKE ``QUEEN OF TV MOVIES AND TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES'' ______ HON.

Sadly, following her Oscar win, Patty Duke began to privately unravel. The abuse she endured along with her family's history of bipolar disorder began to plague her. All the while, she continued to dazzle the outside world with a successful career. Patty Duke then starred in her own sitcom called The Patty Duke Show, which she artfully played two cousin characters simultaneously. In 1965, she also became a pop music contender with her top 10 hit ``Don't Just Stand There'' and headlined the acclaimed film Billie, which was the first movie ever sold to a television network. Thus, began Patty Duke's reign as the ``Queen of TV Movies.'' Patty Duke continued her big-screen career by starring in the cult classic Valley of The Dolls in 1967 and indie films such as Me, Natalie in 1969. Patty Duke married assistant director Harry Falk, remaining in the marriage from 1965 to 1969. After her marriage ended, Patty Duke bore a son named Sean Patrick Duke. In 1972, she married actor John Astin, who played Gomez in the television version of The Addams Family. John Astin adopted her son Sean, and fathered her second son, Mackenzie Astin, born in 1973. Then in 1976, Patty Duke won her second Emmy for the highly successful mini-series Captains and the Kings. Other popular TV movies followed, including the 1979 small screen version of The Miracle Worker, in which she portrayed Anne Sullivan, a role that won her third Emmy. In the mid-1980s, she became president of the Screen Actors Guild. Her 1987 autobiography, Call Me Anna, was made into a TV movie in 1990 in which she portrayed herself and served as co-producer. Following in 1992 second book, A Brilliant Madness: Living With Manic Depression Illness, was published. With the help of family and friends Patty Duke was able to quiet her personal demons, and become a vocal advocate for those suffering from mental illnesses, along with dispelling social stigmas attached to them. Patty Duke died on March 29, 2016 in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, at the age of 69 from a sepsis infection from a ruptured intestine. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to take a moment of silence in remembrance of this strong woman who was able to stand against the suffocating struggles of depression and became a source of inspiration for hundreds of thousands of Americans struggling with mental illnesses. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E394] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PATTY DUKE ``QUEEN OF TV MOVIES AND TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES'' ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Patty Duke, an American icon and advocate for those suffering in silence from various forms of mental illness, who passed away on March 29, 2016 at the age of 69. Patty Duke was born Anna Marie Duke on December 14, 1946 in Elmhurst, New York. Anna Duke and her siblings grew up in a difficult household, raised by an alcoholic father and a mother who suffered from what was then called ``manic depression,'' later known to be bipolar disorder. Anna Duke was introduced to acting by her brother's managers, John and Ethel Ross, who changed her name to Patty and eventually became her guardians. Later in Patty Duke's life, she revealed that she was a survivor of sexual assault. In 1959, Patty Duke's first big role came when she was cast as Helen Keller in the Broadway version of The Miracle Worker, with Anne Bancroft portraying her teacher, Anne Sullivan. Then in 1962, that play was turned into a feature film, in which she also starred. For her performance in the film, the 16-year-old won a ``Promising Newcomer'' Golden Globe as well as an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress--making her the youngest person to win an Oscar at that time.

ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, today marks the end of an era at the Jewish Federation and Jewish Community Center of Greater New Haven as they gather to celebrate the retirement of their President and CEO, and my dear friend, Sydney Alderman Perry. Sydney began her career with the Jewish Federation and JCC nearly 30 years ago in the Department of Jewish Education. Education was her passion and over the course of her seventeen years in that department she not only worked to improve the synagogue supplementary schools, she also developed and implemented a number of innovative education programs for both adults and teens. In addition to ``A Taste of Honey,'' an adult learning lecture series that attracts hundreds of adults, Sydney spearheaded the Israel Experience Savings program, which helps young people travel to Israel and initiated Talmud Torah Meyuchad, an individualized Jewish education program for children with special needs. But perhaps the contribution she is most proud of is the establishment of the successful community Hebrew High School, MAKOM, which serves hundreds of teens throughout the New Haven area every year. She was tapped as associate executive director to supervise such things as the Holocaust Education and Prejudice Reduction Project and went on to become the executive director of the federation for six years, before taking on the title of CEO of the merged federation and the Jewish Community Center of New Haven. Under her leadership the federation has expanded its agenda and outreach to enhance Jewish life and enrich the lives of those most in need both locally and internationally. Food4Kids sends local students who depend on the breakfast and lunch programs home with a backpack of staples for the weekends. The Jewish Coalition for Literacy has more than two hundred volunteers who read and talk with students. The federation supports the elderly housing complexes as well as educational institutions across Greater New Haven and raises funds for Yale Hillel and the University of Connecticut Hillel; the Jewish Historical Society and the JCC. Beyond her leadership at the Jewish Federation and JCC, Sydney is an extraordinary advocate for Jewish continuity. She has served as a consultant to the community on educational endeavors, including the Anne Frank Project, Shepherd '92, Jerusalem 3000 and the celebration of Israel's 50th Anniversary. Sydney is an extraordinary scholar, often called upon nationally to give workshops and has served as scholar-in- residence for several communities. Sydney has shown an unparalleled dedication to Jewish education in our community and throughout the nation--a commitment that is reflected in the myriad of awards she has been honored with over the years. She is an inspiration. I am proud to join the many family, friends, and colleagues who have gathered this evening in extending my sincere thanks and appreciation to Sydney Alderman Perry for her incredible work with the Jewish Federation and Jewish Community Center of Greater New Haven and her outstanding service to our community. My very best wishes to her, her children, and grandchildren for many more years of health and happiness as she enjoys her retirement.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Ryanne Mullen of Villisca, Iowa, for being awarded first place for her outstanding essay honoring our military veterans by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of Iowa. Ryanne is a student at Enarson Elementary in Villisca, Iowa. The theme for this essay contest was ``What Does A Veteran Mean To Me?'', and was open to all fifth graders in public, private, and home schools throughout Iowa. Ryanne's essay reads: I deeply thought about what a veteran means to me. I have chosen to share emotional descriptions of what a veteran means to me. The initial meaning of a veteran to me is how fear is considered, understood, and accepted but they still make the decision to face this fear for the freedom of their families and all other families they are standing strong for. The second meaning of a veteran to me is courage. The attitude of never giving up, never backing down, and always remaining faithful. These are characteristics of semper fidelis. The third meaning I want to express is brotherhood, which is described as equally caring for the life of your fellow soldier. The fact that no one is left behind especially the veterans that are KIA, MIA, or POW. I will carry memories of them with me forever. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate Ryanne for earning this award. It is because of Iowans like her that I'm proud to represent our great state. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Ryanne for writing this outstanding essay honoring our veterans.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Ryanne Mullen of Villisca, Iowa, for being awarded first place for her outstanding essay honoring our military veterans by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of Iowa. Ryanne is a student at Enarson Elementary in Villisca, Iowa. The theme for this essay contest was ``What Does A Veteran Mean To Me?'', and was open to all fifth graders in public, private, and home schools throughout Iowa. Ryanne's essay reads: I deeply thought about what a veteran means to me. I have chosen to share emotional descriptions of what a veteran means to me. The initial meaning of a veteran to me is how fear is considered, understood, and accepted but they still make the decision to face this fear for the freedom of their families and all other families they are standing strong for. The second meaning of a veteran to me is courage. The attitude of never giving up, never backing down, and always remaining faithful. These are characteristics of semper fidelis. The third meaning I want to express is brotherhood, which is described as equally caring for the life of your fellow soldier. The fact that no one is left behind especially the veterans that are KIA, MIA, or POW. I will carry memories of them with me forever. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate Ryanne for earning this award. It is because of Iowans like her that I'm proud to represent our great state. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Ryanne for writing this outstanding essay honoring our veterans.

Daniel and Rachel are students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Their powerful documentary, ``Target,'' explores the issues and arguments surrounding gun safety and school shootings. The theme of this year's contest was ``Road to the White House: What's the Issue You Most Want Candidates to Discuss during the 2016 Presidential Campaign?'' Nearly three thousand video submissions from almost six thousand students across the nation were submitted to this contest, and I am thrilled that Daniel and Rachel's documentary was recognized as exceptional. I am honored that these young filmmakers chose to interview me for their documentary. In my remarks, I expressed my deep concern regarding gun violence in America, especially in schools. Our students must be able to study and learn in a safe environment absent the threat of gun violence. With an average of nearly one school shooting every week, this documentary covers a timely and vital issue facing our nation. Again, congratulations to Daniel and Rachel. I wish them the best of luck with their future endeavors and academic pursuits. It is with great pleasure that I honor them, and I hope they will continue to inspire young South Floridians to become involved in issues they care about. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E395] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DANIEL BEN-ZAKEN AND RACHEL BEAN ______ HON.

BARBARA COMSTOCK of virginia in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to acknowledge one of my constituents who has demonstrated day-in day-out what living the American dream really means. Bill Haney graduated from the College of New Jersey with a Bachelor of Science in Education. While teaching elementary school in Talbot County, Maryland, Bill worked to earn his Master's Degree in Supervision and Human Relations from George Washington University. In 1983, Mr. Haney accepted the position of Chief Executive Officer of Every Citizen Has Opportunities, Inc. (ECHO), a Leesburg, Virginia based non-profit which provides employment, training, and community integration to individuals with disabilities. Mr. Haney has decided it is time to retire from his life's work, thus ending a bright chapter in ECHO's history. As Mr. Haney's extraordinary career comes to a close, I would like to take a moment to highlight the work he has done over the years. When Mr. Haney took over as CEO at ECHO, the organization was supporting about 75 individuals with disabilities, with an annual budget of under three hundred thousand dollars, and only two worksites. Under Mr. Haney's leadership, ECHO's budget has grown to nearly five million dollars, and has expanded services to nearly 170 individuals with disabilities. ECHO has approximately 15 work locations, ranging from Loudoun County Public Schools to Inova Hospitals. In addition to his work at ECHO, Mr. Haney has extended his skills to the community through his work on the Board of Directors for the Loudoun County Red Cross, as Cubmaster for the Pack 11 Boy Scouts in Boyce, Virginia, and as a Sunday school teacher at St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Front Royal, Virginia. Mr. Haney leaves ECHO after a storied 33 years at the helm with zero debt, positive cash flow, and outright ownership of its facility. ECHO will continue serving our community, but without a doubt, will miss Mr. Haney's leadership and dedication. At this moment, Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in extending our sincerest thanks to Mr. Haney for all the work he has done in our community, and wish him the best in his future endeavors.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E396-E397] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE 48TH ANNIVERSARY OF ASSASSINATION OF REV. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this year, the nation observes for the 48th year, the anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Each year on this day, Americans remember the life and legacy of a man who brought hope and healing to America. Fatally shot at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on Thursday, April 4,1968, at the age of 39, Dr. King was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. that evening. He was a prominent leader of the Civil Rights Movement and Nobel laureate for Peace who was known for his creative use of nonviolence and civil disobedience. Our hearts continue beating, rejoicing his enduring legacy, and knowing that nothing is impossible when we are guided by the better angels of our nature. The incident of domestic terrorism that took the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life, reminds us of his belief, ``that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.'' Dr. King confronted the risk of death and made that recognition part of his philosophy. He taught that murder could not stop the struggle for equal rights. His inspiring words filled a great void in our nation, and answered our collective longing to become a country that truly lived by its noblest principles. Yet, Dr. King knew that it was not enough just to talk the talk; he had to walk the walk for his words to be credible. And so we commemorate on this day a man of action, who put his life on the line for freedom and justice every day. We honor the courage of a man who endured harassment, threats and beatings, and even bombings. We commemorate the man who went to jail 29 times to achieve freedom for others, and who knew he would pay the ultimate price for his leadership, but kept on marching, protesting and organizing anyway. Dr. King once said that we all have to decide whether we, ``will walk in the light of creative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness. ``Life's most persistent and nagging question,'' he said, is ``what are you doing for others?'' Strikingly, when Dr. King discussed the end of his mortal life during one of his last sermons, ``I've Been to the Mountain Top,'' on February 4, 1968, in the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church, even then he lifted the value of service upward as the hallmark of a full life, remarking: ``I'd like somebody to mention on that day, Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I want you to say on that day, that I did try in my life . . . to love and serve humanity.'' We should also remember that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was, above all, a person who was always willing to speak the truth. There is perhaps no better example of Dr. King's moral integrity and consistency than his criticism of the Vietnam War, waged by the Johnson Administration; an administration that was otherwise a friend and champion of civil and human rights. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 15, 1929. His youth was spent in our country's Deep South, then run by Jim Crow laws and the Klu Klux Klan. For young African-Americans, it was an environment even more dangerous than the one they face today. Nonetheless, a young Martin managed to find a dream; one that he pieced together from his readings, including the Bible, classics, philosophical literature, and just about any other book he could get his hands on. Not only did those books allow him to educate himself, they also allowed him to work through the destructive and traumatic experiences of blatant discrimination, and the discriminatory abuse inflicted on him, his family, and humanity. The life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we honor today, could have turned out to be the life of just another African-American who would have had to learn to be happy with the limitations of his circumstances--with only what he was allowed. He learned however, to use his imagination and his dreams to see right through those ``White Only'' signs--to see the reality that all men, and women, regardless of their place of origin, their gender, or their creed, are created equal. Through his studies, Dr. King learned that training his mind and broadening his intellect effectively shielded him from the demoralizing effects of segregation and discrimination. Dr. King was a dreamer. His dreams were a tool, through which he was able to lift his mind beyond the reality of his segregated society and into a realm where it was possible that white and black, red, yellow and brown, and all others live and work alongside each other and prosper. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. however, was not an idle daydreamer. He shared his visions through speeches that motivated others to join the nonviolent effort to lift themselves from poverty and isolation and create an even better America where equal justice is a fact of life. In the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are Created Equal.'' At that time and for centuries to come, African-Americans were historically, culturally, socially and legally excluded from inclusion in the institutional execution of that declaration. Dr. King's ``I Have a Dream'' Speech, delivered nearly 53 years ago, on August 28, 1963, was a clarion call to each citizen of this great nation that still echoes today. His request was simply and eloquently conveyed--asking America to allow its citizens to live out the words written in its Declaration of Independence and to have a place in this nation's Bill of Rights. Provoking that clarion call, the 1960s were a time of great crisis and conflict. The nightmares of Americans were filled with troubling images that rose like lava from volcanoes of violence and the terrors that they had to face, both domestically and internationally. The decade bore the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War; and Americans were left to cradle the assassinations of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Malcolm X, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the man we honor here today. Dr. Martin Luther King's dream helped us turn the corner on civil rights. Set in motion with Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, enduring 381 days, ending only when the United States Supreme Court ruled that discrimination, on account of race in the field of interstate public transportation, was unconstitutional. The dream whisked forward into the hearts of those aggrieved in Alabama's Bible belt and the minds of Selma citizens organizing and peacefully marching for suffrage on March 7, 1965--a march that ended with violence at the hands of law enforcement officers, as demonstrators crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Dr. King used nonviolent tactics to protest against Jim Crow laws in the South, organizing and leading demonstrations for desegregation, labor and voting rights. When the life of Dr. Martin Luther King was stolen from us, he was still a very young man, only 39 years old. People remember that Dr. King died in Memphis, but few remember why he was there. On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came to Memphis to support a strike by the city's sanitation workers. The sanitation workers there had recently formed a chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to demand better wages and working conditions for themselves. The city, however, refused to recognize the union and when the 1,300 employees walked off of their jobs, the police broke up the rally with mace and police batons. Resultantly, union leaders summoned Dr. King to Memphis. Despite the danger he might face, entering such a volatile situation, it was an invitation he could not refuse--not because he longed for danger, but because the labor movement was deeply intertwined with the civil rights movement, for which he gave so many years of his life. Moments before his murder, Dr. King went out onto the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis and standing near his room, he was struck at 6:01 p.m., by a single .30-06 bullet that James Earl Ray fired from a Remington Model 760 Gamemaster, completing the assassination. The killing sparked outcry and riots across the country, in addition to stimulating political support for passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968. For some, Dr. King's assassination meant the end of the strategy of nonviolence. Others in the movement reaffirmed the need to carry on his work--as the nations' work--continuing the tradition of nonviolence. That night in Indianapolis, shortly after discovering that Dr. King had been murdered, New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy, campaigning to gain the presidential nomination to represent the Democratic Party, who himself would be murdered in Los Angles two months later, addressed an angry, heart-broken, shocked, and horrified audience in a predominantly black neighborhood of the city. The Chief of Police in Indianapolis advised Senator Kennedy that he could not provide protection and was worried he would be at risk in talking about the death of the revered leader. Robert Kennedy saw something more powerful though and, channeling Dr. King's spirit, decided to go ahead. Standing on a flatbed truck, he spoke acknowledging that many would be filled with anger as rumors of riots palpated in listeners' hearts. He said: ``For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed . . . killed by a white [[Page E397]] man.'' The Senator said that the country had to make an effort to, ``go beyond these rather difficult times,'' and needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and for the country. The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will never overshadow his life. His legacy as a dreamer and a man of action stands strong. It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace. It is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled. I hope that Dr. King's vision of equality under the law is never lost to us who, in the present, toil in times of disparities of inequity. For without that vision--without that dream-- we can never continue to improve on our collective human condition. For those who have already forgotten, or whose vision is already clouded by the fog of complacency, I would like to recite the immortal words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: ``I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former shareholders will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day, even the State of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but for the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping with words of interposition and nullification--one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.'' Positioning the nation to accept a bold call to action to address the wrongs of slavery, ``separate, but equal,'' boycotts, assassinations, and Black power--he gave a much longed for voice to the history of uprising that drove global civil rights forward. Dr. King's dream did not stop at racial equality; his ultimate dream was one of human equality and dignity. He believed that freedom and justice were the birthrights of every individual in America. His dream became the dream of a people, documenting their collective challenges and struggle toward change; a hope to achieve a more perfect Union. The powerful words of his beloved widow Coretta Scott King remind us that, ``Freedom is never really won; you earn it and win it in every generation.'' Were he alive today, I believe that Dr. King would embolden us to acknowledge that this story and struggle, that started many centuries ago, continues today--with you. His, is an American story, and it is for us, the living, to continue that fight today and forever, following the great spirit that inspired the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 54 (Monday, April 11, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E396-E397] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE 48TH ANNIVERSARY OF ASSASSINATION OF REV.

His request was simply and eloquently conveyed--asking America to allow its citizens to live out the words written in its Declaration of Independence and to have a place in this nation's Bill of Rights. Provoking that clarion call, the 1960s were a time of great crisis and conflict. The nightmares of Americans were filled with troubling images that rose like lava from volcanoes of violence and the terrors that they had to face, both domestically and internationally. The decade bore the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War; and Americans were left to cradle the assassinations of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Malcolm X, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the man we honor here today. Dr. Martin Luther King's dream helped us turn the corner on civil rights. Set in motion with Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, enduring 381 days, ending only when the United States Supreme Court ruled that discrimination, on account of race in the field of interstate public transportation, was unconstitutional. The dream whisked forward into the hearts of those aggrieved in Alabama's Bible belt and the minds of Selma citizens organizing and peacefully marching for suffrage on March 7, 1965--a march that ended with violence at the hands of law enforcement officers, as demonstrators crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Dr. King used nonviolent tactics to protest against Jim Crow laws in the South, organizing and leading demonstrations for desegregation, labor and voting rights. When the life of Dr. Martin Luther King was stolen from us, he was still a very young man, only 39 years old. People remember that Dr. King died in Memphis, but few remember why he was there. On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came to Memphis to support a strike by the city's sanitation workers. The sanitation workers there had recently formed a chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to demand better wages and working conditions for themselves. The city, however, refused to recognize the union and when the 1,300 employees walked off of their jobs, the police broke up the rally with mace and police batons. Resultantly, union leaders summoned Dr. King to Memphis. Despite the danger he might face, entering such a volatile situation, it was an invitation he could not refuse--not because he longed for danger, but because the labor movement was deeply intertwined with the civil rights movement, for which he gave so many years of his life. Moments before his murder, Dr. King went out onto the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis and standing near his room, he was struck at 6:01 p.m., by a single .30-06 bullet that James Earl Ray fired from a Remington Model 760 Gamemaster, completing the assassination. The killing sparked outcry and riots across the country, in addition to stimulating political support for passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968. For some, Dr. King's assassination meant the end of the strategy of nonviolence. Others in the movement reaffirmed the need to carry on his work--as the nations' work--continuing the tradition of nonviolence. That night in Indianapolis, shortly after discovering that Dr. King had been murdered, New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy, campaigning to gain the presidential nomination to represent the Democratic Party, who himself would be murdered in Los Angles two months later, addressed an angry, heart-broken, shocked, and horrified audience in a predominantly black neighborhood of the city. The Chief of Police in Indianapolis advised Senator Kennedy that he could not provide protection and was worried he would be at risk in talking about the death of the revered leader. Robert Kennedy saw something more powerful though and, channeling Dr. King's spirit, decided to go ahead. Standing on a flatbed truck, he spoke acknowledging that many would be filled with anger as rumors of riots palpated in listeners' hearts. He said: ``For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed . . . killed by a white [[Page E397]] man.'' The Senator said that the country had to make an effort to, ``go beyond these rather difficult times,'' and needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and for the country. The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will never overshadow his life. His legacy as a dreamer and a man of action stands strong. It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace. It is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled. I hope that Dr. King's vision of equality under the law is never lost to us who, in the present, toil in times of disparities of inequity. For without that vision--without that dream-- we can never continue to improve on our collective human condition. For those who have already forgotten, or whose vision is already clouded by the fog of complacency, I would like to recite the immortal words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: ``I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former shareholders will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day, even the State of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but for the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping with words of interposition and nullification--one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.'' Positioning the nation to accept a bold call to action to address the wrongs of slavery, ``separate, but equal,'' boycotts, assassinations, and Black power--he gave a much longed for voice to the history of uprising that drove global civil rights forward. Dr. King's dream did not stop at racial equality; his ultimate dream was one of human equality and dignity. He believed that freedom and justice were the birthrights of every individual in America. His dream became the dream of a people, documenting their collective challenges and struggle toward change; a hope to achieve a more perfect Union. The powerful words of his beloved widow Coretta Scott King remind us that, ``Freedom is never really won; you earn it and win it in every generation.'' Were he alive today, I believe that Dr. King would embolden us to acknowledge that this story and struggle, that started many centuries ago, continues today--with you. His, is an American story, and it is for us, the living, to continue that fight today and forever, following the great spirit that inspired the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ____________________",package_114_161.csv,13280,13280,13347,"[congressional record volume 162, number 54 (monday, april 11, 2016)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e396-e397] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] the 48th anniversary of assassination of rev. dr. martin luther king, jr. ______ hon. sheila jackson lee of texas in the house of representatives monday, april 11, 2016 ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, this year, the nation observes for the 48th year, the anniversary of the assassination of the rev. dr. martin luther king, jr. each year on this day, americans remember the life and legacy of a man who brought hope and healing to america. fatally shot at the lorraine motel in memphis, tennessee, on thursday, april 4,1968, at the age of 39, dr. king was rushed to st. joseph's hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. that evening. he was a prominent leader of the civil rights movement and nobel laureate for peace who was known for his creative use of nonviolence and civil disobedience. our hearts continue beating, rejoicing his enduring legacy, and knowing that nothing is impossible when we are guided by the better angels of our nature. the incident of domestic terrorism that took the rev. dr. martin luther king, jr.'s life, reminds us of his belief, ``that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. this is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.'' dr. king confronted the risk of death and made that recognition part of his philosophy. he taught that murder could not stop the struggle for equal rights. his inspiring words filled a great void in our nation, and answered our collective longing to become a country that truly lived by its noblest principles. yet, dr. king knew that it was not enough just to talk the talk; he had to walk the walk for his words to be credible. and so we commemorate on this day a man of action, who put his life on the line for freedom and justice every day. we honor the courage of a man who endured harassment, threats and beatings, and even bombings. we commemorate the man who went to jail 29 times to achieve freedom for others, and who knew he would pay the ultimate price for his leadership, but kept on marching, protesting and organizing anyway. dr. king once said that we all have to decide whether we, ``will walk in the light of creative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness. ``life's most persistent and nagging question,'' he said, is ``what are you doing for others?'' strikingly, when dr. king discussed the end of his mortal life during one of his last sermons, ``i've been to the mountain top,'' on february 4, 1968, in the pulpit of ebenezer baptist church, even then he lifted the value of service upward as the hallmark of a full life, remarking: ``i'd like somebody to mention on that day, martin luther king, jr. tried to give his life serving others. i want you to say on that day, that i did try in my life . . . to love and serve humanity.'' we should also remember that the rev. dr. martin luther king, jr. was, above all, a person who was always willing to speak the truth. there is perhaps no better example of dr. king's moral integrity and consistency than his criticism of the vietnam war, waged by the johnson administration; an administration that was otherwise a friend and champion of civil and human rights. martin luther king, jr. was born in atlanta, georgia on january 15, 1929. his youth was spent in our country's deep south, then run by jim crow laws and the klu klux klan. for young african-americans, it was an environment even more dangerous than the one they face today. nonetheless, a young martin managed to find a dream; one that he pieced together from his readings, including the bible, classics, philosophical literature, and just about any other book he could get his hands on. not only did those books allow him to educate himself, they also allowed him to work through the destructive and traumatic experiences of blatant discrimination, and the discriminatory abuse inflicted on him, his family, and humanity. the life of the rev. dr. martin luther king, jr. that we honor today, could have turned out to be the life of just another african-american who would have had to learn to be happy with the limitations of his circumstances--with only what he was allowed. he learned however, to use his imagination and his dreams to see right through those ``white only'' signs--to see the reality that all men, and women, regardless of their place of origin, their gender, or their creed, are created equal. through his studies, dr. king learned that training his mind and broadening his intellect effectively shielded him from the demoralizing effects of segregation and discrimination. dr. king was a dreamer. his dreams were a tool, through which he was able to lift his mind beyond the reality of his segregated society and into a realm where it was possible that white and black, red, yellow and brown, and all others live and work alongside each other and prosper. the rev. dr. martin luther king, jr. however, was not an idle daydreamer. he shared his visions through speeches that motivated others to join the nonviolent effort to lift themselves from poverty and isolation and create an even better america where equal justice is a fact of life. in the declaration of independence in 1776, thomas jefferson wrote, ``we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'' at that time and for centuries to come, african-americans were historically, culturally, socially and legally excluded from inclusion in the institutional execution of that declaration. dr. king's ``i have a dream'' speech, delivered nearly 53 years ago, on august 28, 1963, was a clarion call to each citizen of this great nation that still echoes today. his request was simply and eloquently conveyed--asking america to allow its citizens to live out the words written in its declaration of independence and to have a place in this nation's bill of rights. provoking
