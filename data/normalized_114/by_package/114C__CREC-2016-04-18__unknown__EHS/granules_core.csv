This year Americans will collectively spend more on taxes than basic necessities like food, clothing, and housing combined. New ObamaCare taxes destroy jobs.

Specifically, Melanie was recognized for designing and putting in place lesson plans which educate, motivate, and inspire high school students and their communities to take personal responsibility for improving their health habits. Melanie's classes involve not only the academic knowledge of which nutrients are best for their diets, but also about topics such as peer pressure, bullying, eating disorders, and how to eat right once they graduate high school. Lynch is assisted in those efforts by the textbook she co-wrote entitled ``Comprehensive Health.''

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1638) to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to Congress information on the Department of Homeland Security headquarters consolidation project in the National Capital Region, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 1638 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. INFORMATION ON DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HEADQUARTERS CONSOLIDATION PROJECT. (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in coordination with the Administrator, shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress information on the implementation of the enhanced plan for the Department headquarters consolidation project within the National Capital Region, approved by the Office of Management and Budget and included in the budget of the President for fiscal year 2016 (as submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code), that includes the following: (1) A proposed occupancy plan for the consolidation project that includes specific information about which Department- wide operations, component operations, and support offices will be located at the site, the aggregate number of full time equivalent employees projected to occupy the site, the seat-to-staff ratio at the site, and schedule estimates for migrating operations to the site. (2) A comprehensive assessment of the difference between the current real property and facilities needed by the Department in the National Capital Region in order to carry out the mission of the Department and the future needs of the Department. (3) A current plan for construction of the headquarters consolidation at the St. Elizabeths campus that includes-- (A) the estimated costs and schedule for the current plan, which shall conform to relevant Federal guidance for cost and schedule estimates, consistent with the recommendation of the Government Accountability Office in the September 2014 report entitled ``Federal Real Property: DHS and GSA Need to Strengthen the Management of DHS Headquarters Consolidation'' (GAO-14-648); and (B) any estimated cost savings associated with reducing the scope of the consolidation project and increasing the use of existing capacity developed under the project. (4) A current plan for the leased portfolio of the Department in the National Capital Region that includes-- (A) an end-state vision that identifies which Department- wide operations, component operations, and support offices do not migrate to the St. Elizabeths campus and continue to operate at a property in the leased portfolio; (B) for each year until the consolidation project is completed, the number of full-time equivalent employees who are expected to operate at each property, component, or office; (C) the anticipated total rentable square feet leased per year during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on the date on which the consolidation project is completed; and (D) timing and anticipated lease terms for leased space under the plan referred to in paragraph (3). (5) An analysis that identifies the costs and benefits of leasing and construction alternatives for the remainder of the consolidation project that includes-- (A) a comparison of the long-term cost that would result from leasing as compared [[Page H1771]] to consolidating functions on Government-owned space; and (B) the identification of any cost impacts in terms of premiums for short-term lease extensions or holdovers due to the uncertainty of funding for, or delays in, completing construction required for the consolidation. (b) Comptroller General Review.-- (1) Review required.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall review the cost and schedule estimates submitted under subsection (a) to evaluate the quality and reliability of the estimates. (2) Assessment.--Not later than 90 days after the submittal of the cost and schedule estimates under subsection (a), the Comptroller General shall report to the appropriate committees of Congress on the results of the review required under paragraph (1). (c) Definitions.--In this Act: (1) The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of General Services. (2) The term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate. (3) The term ``Department'' means the Department of Homeland Security. (4) The term ``National Capital Region'' has the meaning given the term under section 2674(f)(2) of title 10, United States Code. (5) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Homeland Security. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. General Leave Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1638. Mr. Speaker, since construction began in 2006, the Department of Homeland Security's consolidated headquarters on St. Elizabeth's historic Washington, D.C. campus has been riddled with cost overruns and construction delays, at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. As the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, I conducted rigorous oversight of the project, including holding a hearing in September 2014. Having visited the site, I saw firsthand the immense challenges that lie ahead. While we are encouraged by the recently updated DHS St. Elizabeth's plan, we still believe that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the efficient use of taxpayer dollars, especially considering this project was fully funded through the fiscal year 2016 appropriations, and DHS alone has requested $225 million for fiscal year 2017. This bill that we are talking about today, the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act, a companion to H.R. 1640, which was passed by the House unanimously in June of last year and of which I was a cosponsor, will require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the administrator of General Services, to submit a report on the implementation of the updated plan for the headquarters consolidation, including estimated costs and occupancy plans of the project. With a project of this magnitude, improved oversight and increased transparency is paramount. Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once said that an educated citizenry is ``the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.'' Our constituents expect their representatives to hold government accountable. S. 1638 does just that. I wish to thank Senators Johnson and Carper for their hard work passing this bill through the Senate. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important bipartisan legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 1638, the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, since the 2006 decision to establish the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters at the former site of St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, the project has experienced significant shortfalls in cost and schedule performance. The Government Accountability Office reported that between the start of construction at St. Elizabeth's in fiscal year 2009 through the fiscal year 2014 appropriation, the project received $1.6 billion less than the funding amendments requested over this period. The impact of this funding gap is far-reaching. In fact, GAO has found this gap resulted in cost escalations exceeding $1 billion and schedule delays exceeding 10 years for the project. Mr. Speaker, the Senate bill we consider today is the companion to H.R. 1640, a bill that the House approved by voice vote last June. S. 1638 directs DHS and GSA to provide information to Congress within 120 days of enactment of this bill to establish that the data has been collected and analyzed to support the current direction for this high- profile investment. In addition, Mr. Speaker, S. 1638 specifies that the information provided to Congress by DHS and GSA include updated cost and schedule estimates for the project. Finally, Mr. Speaker, S. 1638 directs GAO to report to Congress on the quality and reliability of these estimates, not later than 90 days after they have been submitted to Congress. Mr. Speaker, DHS headquarters operations currently are dispersed around the national capital region, in facilities that, in many cases, are inadequate--as is the case with the Nebraska Avenue Complex. To support the government's effective stewardship of public resources and to deliver a headquarters that DHS desperately needs, I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. S. 1638 is virtually identical to the House-passed legislation that my subcommittee advanced last year. The bill's provisions acknowledge the need for GSA to be engaged at a high level, as the construction manager for the Department's headquarters consolidation project, and to help DHS develop realistic and achievable outcomes. I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that up to 69 percent of the Department's commercial leases in the national capital region are slated to expire between fiscal years 2016 and 2020. As such, the Department will be forced to engage in the expensive process of recompeting and possibly relocating its operation and personnel. It would behoove the Department and the GSA to move more of DHS' headquarters activities to St. Elizabeth's as soon as possible and, thus, avoid the costs associated with executing additional leasing in the expensive D.C. market. Mr. Speaker, I do again urge the adoption of S. 1638. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support S. 1638. I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for her words of support. This is the right thing to do--being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and fulfilling our oversight role. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of S. 1638, the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act.'' I support this bipartisan legislation because it would move DHS forward in accomplishing the important objective of establishing a home for the Department's many components and agencies. Eleven days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge was appointed as the first Director of the Office of Homeland Security in the White House. [[Page H1772]] In November 2002, I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to create a Department of Homeland Security. On March 1, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security official became a Cabinet-level department charged with the responsibility of unifying national homeland security efforts. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created through the integration of all or part of 22 different Federal departments and agencies into a unified, integrated Department. S. 1638, directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA), to submit information on the implementation of the enhanced plan for the DHS headquarters consolidation project within the National Capital Region, approved by the Office of Management and Budget and included in the budget of the President for FY2016, that includes: a proposed occupancy plan with specific information about which DHS- wide operations, component operations, and support offices will be located at the site, the aggregate number of full time equivalent employees projected to occupy the site, the seat-to-staff ratio at the site, and schedule estimates for migrating operations to the site; a comprehensive assessment of the difference between the current real property and facilities needed by DHS in the Region to carry out its mission and its future needs; an analysis of the difference between the current and needed capital assets and facilities of DHS; a current plan for construction of the headquarters consolidation at the St. Elizabeths campus that includes the estimated costs and schedule for the current plan and any estimated cost savings associated with reducing the scope of the project and increasing the use of existing capacity developed under the project; An important goal of S. 1638, is an evaluation of the current plan to determine the leased portfolio of DHS throughout the Region that includes an end-state vision that identifies which DHS-wide operations, component operations, and support offices do not migrate to the St. Elizabeths campus and continue to operate at a property in the leased portfolio. The bill will result in real numbers regarding the total compliment of full-time equivalent employees who are expected to operate at each property, component, or office for each year until the consolidation project is completed. S. 1638, identifies the costs and benefits of leasing and construction alternatives for the remainder of the consolidation project, including a comparison of the long-term cost that would result from leasing to the cost of consolidating functions on government-owned space and the identification of any cost impacts in terms of premiums for short-term lease extensions or holdovers due to the uncertainty of funding for, or delays in, completing construction required for the consolidation. Mr. Speaker, since DHS initiated its headquarters consolidation in 2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning funding support from Congress. As a result, in April 2015, DHS and GSA announced that the construction sequence and timetable for the headquarters consolidation would be adjusted to reflect reduced funding by Congress. DHS must now re-compete up to 69 percent of its commercial leases in the National Capital Region as they are scheduled to expire between 2016 and 2020. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the suspension bill, S. 1638, the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1638. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1770-H1772] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HEADQUARTERS CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015 Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. General Leave Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1638. Mr. Speaker, since construction began in 2006, the Department of Homeland Security's consolidated headquarters on St. Elizabeth's historic Washington, D.C. campus has been riddled with cost overruns and construction delays, at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. As the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, I conducted rigorous oversight of the project, including holding a hearing in September 2014. Having visited the site, I saw firsthand the immense challenges that lie ahead. While we are encouraged by the recently updated DHS St. Elizabeth's plan, we still believe that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the efficient use of taxpayer dollars, especially considering this project was fully funded through the fiscal year 2016 appropriations, and DHS alone has requested $225 million for fiscal year 2017. This bill that we are talking about today, the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act, a companion to H.R. 1640, which was passed by the House unanimously in June of last year and of which I was a cosponsor, will require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the administrator of General Services, to submit a report on the implementation of the updated plan for the headquarters consolidation, including estimated costs and occupancy plans of the project. With a project of this magnitude, improved oversight and increased transparency is paramount. Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once said that an educated citizenry is ``the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.'' Our constituents expect their representatives to hold government accountable. S. 1638 does just that. I wish to thank Senators Johnson and Carper for their hard work passing this bill through the Senate. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important bipartisan legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 1638, the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, since the 2006 decision to establish the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters at the former site of St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, the project has experienced significant shortfalls in cost and schedule performance. The Government Accountability Office reported that between the start of construction at St. Elizabeth's in fiscal year 2009 through the fiscal year 2014 appropriation, the project received $1.6 billion less than the funding amendments requested over this period. The impact of this funding gap is far-reaching. In fact, GAO has found this gap resulted in cost escalations exceeding $1 billion and schedule delays exceeding 10 years for the project. Mr. Speaker, the Senate bill we consider today is the companion to H.R. 1640, a bill that the House approved by voice vote last June. S. 1638 directs DHS and GSA to provide information to Congress within 120 days of enactment of this bill to establish that the data has been collected and analyzed to support the current direction for this high- profile investment. In addition, Mr. Speaker, S. 1638 specifies that the information provided to Congress by DHS and GSA include updated cost and schedule estimates for the project. Finally, Mr. Speaker, S. 1638 directs GAO to report to Congress on the quality and reliability of these estimates, not later than 90 days after they have been submitted to Congress. Mr. Speaker, DHS headquarters operations currently are dispersed around the national capital region, in facilities that, in many cases, are inadequate--as is the case with the Nebraska Avenue Complex. To support the government's effective stewardship of public resources and to deliver a headquarters that DHS desperately needs, I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. S. 1638 is virtually identical to the House-passed legislation that my subcommittee advanced last year. The bill's provisions acknowledge the need for GSA to be engaged at a high level, as the construction manager for the Department's headquarters consolidation project, and to help DHS develop realistic and achievable outcomes. I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that up to 69 percent of the Department's commercial leases in the national capital region are slated to expire between fiscal years 2016 and 2020. As such, the Department will be forced to engage in the expensive process of recompeting and possibly relocating its operation and personnel.

(mrs. watson coleman) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from south carolina. general leave mr. duncan of south carolina. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from south carolina? there was no objection. mr. duncan of south carolina. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of s. 1638. mr. speaker, since construction began in 2006, the department of homeland security's consolidated headquarters on st. elizabeth's historic washington, d.c. campus has been riddled with cost overruns and construction delays, at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. as the former chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and management efficiency, i conducted rigorous oversight of the project, including holding a hearing in september 2014. having visited the site, i saw firsthand the immense challenges that lie ahead. while we are encouraged by the recently updated dhs st. elizabeth's plan, we still believe that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the efficient use of taxpayer dollars, especially considering this project was fully funded through the fiscal year 2016 appropriations, and dhs alone has requested $225 million for fiscal year 2017. this bill that we are talking about today, the department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountability act, a companion to h.r. 1640, which was passed by the house unanimously in june of last year and of which i was a cosponsor, will require the secretary of homeland security, in coordination with the administrator of general services, to submit a report on the implementation of the updated plan for the headquarters consolidation, including estimated costs and occupancy plans of the project. with a project of this magnitude, improved oversight and increased transparency is paramount. mr. speaker, thomas jefferson once said that an educated citizenry is ``the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.'' our constituents expect their representatives to hold government accountable. s. 1638 does just that. i wish to thank senators johnson and carper for their hard work passing this bill through the senate. i urge all members to join me in supporting this important bipartisan legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of s. 1638, the department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountability act of 2015. mr. speaker, since the 2006 decision to establish the department of homeland security's headquarters at the former site of st. elizabeth's hospital in washington, the project has experienced significant shortfalls in cost and schedule performance. the government accountability office reported that between the start of construction at st. elizabeth's in fiscal year 2009 through the fiscal year 2014 appropriation, the project received $1.6 billion less than the funding amendments requested over this period. the impact of this funding gap is far-reaching. in fact, gao has found this gap resulted in cost escalations exceeding $1 billion and schedule delays exceeding 10 years for the project. mr. speaker, the senate bill we consider today is the companion to h.r. 1640, a bill that the house approved by voice vote last june. s. 1638 directs dhs and gsa to provide information to congress within 120 days of enactment of this bill to establish that the data has been collected and analyzed to support the current direction for this high- profile investment. in addition, mr. speaker, s. 1638 specifies that the information provided to congress by dhs and gsa include updated cost and schedule estimates for the project. finally, mr. speaker, s. 1638 directs gao to report to congress on the quality and reliability of these estimates, not later than 90 days after they have been submitted to congress. mr. speaker, dhs headquarters operations currently are dispersed around the national capital region, in facilities that, in many cases, are inadequate--as is the case with the nebraska avenue complex. to support the government's effective stewardship of public resources and to deliver a headquarters that dhs desperately needs, i would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. duncan of south carolina. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. s. 1638 is virtually identical to the house-passed legislation that my subcommittee advanced last year. the bill's provisions acknowledge the need for gsa to be engaged at a high level, as the construction manager for the department's headquarters consolidation project, and to help dhs develop realistic and achievable outcomes. i would be remiss if i did not acknowledge that up to 69 percent of the department's commercial leases in the national capital region are slated to expire between fiscal years 2016 and 2020. as such, the department will be forced to engage in the expensive process of recompeting and possibly relocating its operation and personnel. it would behoove the department and the gsa to move more of dhs' headquarters activities to st. elizabeth's as soon as possible and, thus, avoid the costs associated with executing additional leasing in the expensive d.c. market. mr. speaker, i do again urge the adoption of s. 1638. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. duncan of south carolina. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i, once again, urge my colleagues to support s. 1638. i thank the gentlewoman from new jersey for her words of support. this is the right thing to do--being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and fulfilling our oversight role. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i rise in strong support of s. 1638, the ``department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountability act.'' i support this bipartisan legislation because it would move dhs forward in accomplishing the important objective of establishing a home for the department's many components and agencies. eleven days after the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, pennsylvania governor tom ridge was appointed as the first director of the office of homeland security in the white house. [[page h1772]] in november 2002, i was proud to join my colleagues in voting to create a department of homeland security. on march 1, 2003, the department of homeland security official became a cabinet-level department charged with the responsibility of unifying national homeland security efforts. the department of homeland security (dhs) was created through the integration of all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies into a unified, integrated department. s. 1638, directs the department of homeland security (dhs), in coordination with the general services administration (gsa), to submit information on the implementation of the enhanced plan for the dhs headquarters consolidation project within the national capital region, approved by the office of management and budget and included in the budget of the president for fy2016, that includes: a proposed occupancy plan with specific information about which dhs- wide operations, component operations, and support offices will be located at the site, the aggregate number of full time equivalent employees projected to occupy the site, the seat-to-staff ratio at the site, and schedule estimates for migrating operations to the site; a comprehensive assessment of the difference between the current real property and facilities needed by dhs in the region to carry out its mission and its future needs; an analysis of the difference between the current and needed capital assets and facilities of dhs; a current plan for construction of the headquarters consolidation at the st. elizabeths campus that includes the estimated costs and schedule for the current plan and any estimated cost savings associated with reducing the scope of the project and increasing the use of existing capacity developed under the project; an important goal of s. 1638, is an evaluation of the current plan to determine the leased portfolio of dhs throughout the region that includes an end-state vision that identifies which dhs-wide operations, component operations, and support offices do not migrate to the st. elizabeths campus and continue to operate at a property in the leased portfolio. the bill will result in real numbers regarding the total compliment of full-time equivalent employees who are expected to operate at each property, component, or office for each year until the consolidation project is completed. s. 1638, identifies the costs and benefits of leasing and construction alternatives for the remainder of the consolidation project, including a comparison of the long-term cost that would result from leasing to the cost of consolidating functions on government-owned space and the identification of any cost impacts in terms of premiums for short-term lease extensions or holdovers due to the uncertainty of funding for, or delays in, completing construction required for the consolidation. mr. speaker, since dhs initiated its headquarters consolidation in 2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning funding support from congress. as a result, in april 2015, dhs and gsa announced that the construction sequence and timetable for the headquarters consolidation would be adjusted to reflect reduced funding by congress. dhs must now re-compete up to 69 percent of its commercial leases in the national capital region as they are scheduled to expire between 2016 and 2020. i urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the suspension bill, s. 1638, the ``department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountability act.'' the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from south carolina (mr. duncan) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 1638. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",16116

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 119) authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 119 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SOAP BOX DERBY RACES.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 119. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H. Con. Res. 119 would authorize the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby on June 18. I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for introducing this resolution and for his long-time support of this event. This annual event is designed to encourage children to show off their [[Page H1774]] work, ingenuity, and creativity as they compete for trophies. These races have been run nationally since 1934. Today, they are held throughout the country, and a few are held throughout the world. The winners of each division are then qualified to compete in the All- American Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio, in July. I support the passage of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my good friend from Maryland, Representative Hoyer, for introducing this resolution on behalf of the Washington regional delegation. This annual competitive event, Mr. Speaker, encourages boys and girls, ages 9 through 16, to construct and operate their own soap box vehicles. The event has become a great tradition in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area over the last 20 years. It provides a terrific opportunity for children to appreciate the workmanship that is necessary to build vehicles and to enjoy the thrill of competition. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the Architect of the Capitol and with the Capitol Police to ensure that the appropriate rules and regulations are in place and that the event remains free to the public. I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation, because it is critically important for the future of our children. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer). Mr. HOYER. I thank both Mr. Curbelo, the chairman of the subcommittee, and the ranking member for moving this resolution forward. I think this is the 25th year that I have sponsored this resolution, and I have had great support throughout. I thank them both. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of this resolution, which I sponsor each year on behalf of the Washington metropolitan delegation, to permit the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold its annual race on the grounds of the Capitol Building. This is a very special year for the soap box derby as it celebrates its 75th anniversary. For three-quarters of a century now, young people from across the Greater Washington, D.C., area have assembled at the Capitol for a fun, educational, and exciting event. First run in 1938, when Norman Rocca sped past 223 of his fellow young racers on New Hampshire Avenue to capture the first soap box derby victory, the race brings together those between ages 8 and 17 to compete in three divisions. Those divisions are Stock, Super Stock, and Masters. The winner of each division will qualify to race against the regional champions from across the country later this year at the All- American Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio. This year's race here in Washington will take place on June 18. There is a reason, of course, the soap box derby has been called the ``greatest amateur racing event in the world.'' It is not only because it is a thrill to watch on race day, but because of everything that happens before race day as well. For weeks in advance, the young drivers and their parents--and, yes, sometimes grandparents--gather in garages and basements to build, test, and improve their soap box racers together. It is a process that brings the generations together and teaches valuable lessons about hard work, science and engineering, sportsmanship, leadership, and pride of achievement. Many of the skills learned in building these soap box racers are the same ones that help students succeed in science, technology, engineering, and math--or the STEM subjects as we refer to them--which will prepare them for success in college and careers. In addition to bringing families together, the soap box derby brings entire communities together with civic groups, police and fire departments, and service organizations that sponsor participants in whom they see the future leaders of their communities and of our country. Mr. Speaker, I said before that this is the 75th anniversary of the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. It also marks, as I said, the 25th year that I have had the honor of sponsoring this resolution. I have done so because I am incredibly proud of this tradition and of all of the young people from Maryland's Fifth District who have participated year after year. In fact, I say with some degree of pride that the Fifth District has been home to many soap box derby champions, including the winners of 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014, which is to say, recently, we have done pretty well, Mr. Speaker. Our racers even brought home national championship victories in 2007 and in 2008. I thank all of those who worked to make the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby possible. I also thank the cosponsors of this resolution: Representatives Chris Van Hollen, Gerry Connolly, Don Beyer, John Delaney, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Donna Edwards, and Barbara Comstock. I hope the House will offer its strong support once again for this great American pastime and for all of those young people and their families who participate. I thank the two gentlemen for their leadership. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I congratulate the gentleman from Maryland on the 25th anniversary of his bringing forward this resolution. The gentleman from Maryland is someone who respects the traditions of this House and who, through his example, teaches younger and newer Members to also respect the traditions of this House. I am proud to support this resolution today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 119.

The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 119 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SOAP BOX DERBY RACES. (a) In General.--The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association (in this resolution referred to as the ``sponsor'') shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, soap box derby races (in this resolution referred to as the ``event''), on the Capitol Grounds.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 119. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H. Con. Res. 119 would authorize the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby on June 18. I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for introducing this resolution and for his long-time support of this event. This annual event is designed to encourage children to show off their [[Page H1774]] work, ingenuity, and creativity as they compete for trophies. These races have been run nationally since 1934. Today, they are held throughout the country, and a few are held throughout the world. The winners of each division are then qualified to compete in the All- American Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio, in July. I support the passage of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my good friend from Maryland, Representative Hoyer, for introducing this resolution on behalf of the Washington regional delegation. This annual competitive event, Mr. Speaker, encourages boys and girls, ages 9 through 16, to construct and operate their own soap box vehicles. The event has become a great tradition in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area over the last 20 years. It provides a terrific opportunity for children to appreciate the workmanship that is necessary to build vehicles and to enjoy the thrill of competition. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the Architect of the Capitol and with the Capitol Police to ensure that the appropriate rules and regulations are in place and that the event remains free to the public. I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation, because it is critically important for the future of our children. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer). Mr. HOYER. I thank both Mr. Curbelo, the chairman of the subcommittee, and the ranking member for moving this resolution forward. I think this is the 25th year that I have sponsored this resolution, and I have had great support throughout. I thank them both. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of this resolution, which I sponsor each year on behalf of the Washington metropolitan delegation, to permit the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold its annual race on the grounds of the Capitol Building. This is a very special year for the soap box derby as it celebrates its 75th anniversary. For three-quarters of a century now, young people from across the Greater Washington, D.C., area have assembled at the Capitol for a fun, educational, and exciting event. First run in 1938, when Norman Rocca sped past 223 of his fellow young racers on New Hampshire Avenue to capture the first soap box derby victory, the race brings together those between ages 8 and 17 to compete in three divisions. Those divisions are Stock, Super Stock, and Masters. The winner of each division will qualify to race against the regional champions from across the country later this year at the All- American Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio. This year's race here in Washington will take place on June 18. There is a reason, of course, the soap box derby has been called the ``greatest amateur racing event in the world.'' It is not only because it is a thrill to watch on race day, but because of everything that happens before race day as well. For weeks in advance, the young drivers and their parents--and, yes, sometimes grandparents--gather in garages and basements to build, test, and improve their soap box racers together. It is a process that brings the generations together and teaches valuable lessons about hard work, science and engineering, sportsmanship, leadership, and pride of achievement. Many of the skills learned in building these soap box racers are the same ones that help students succeed in science, technology, engineering, and math--or the STEM subjects as we refer to them--which will prepare them for success in college and careers. In addition to bringing families together, the soap box derby brings entire communities together with civic groups, police and fire departments, and service organizations that sponsor participants in whom they see the future leaders of their communities and of our country. Mr. Speaker, I said before that this is the 75th anniversary of the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. It also marks, as I said, the 25th year that I have had the honor of sponsoring this resolution. I have done so because I am incredibly proud of this tradition and of all of the young people from Maryland's Fifth District who have participated year after year. In fact, I say with some degree of pride that the Fifth District has been home to many soap box derby champions, including the winners of 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014, which is to say, recently, we have done pretty well, Mr. Speaker. Our racers even brought home national championship victories in 2007 and in 2008. I thank all of those who worked to make the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby possible. I also thank the cosponsors of this resolution: Representatives Chris Van Hollen, Gerry Connolly, Don Beyer, John Delaney, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Donna Edwards, and Barbara Comstock. I hope the House will offer its strong support once again for this great American pastime and for all of those young people and their families who participate. I thank the two gentlemen for their leadership. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I congratulate the gentleman from Maryland on the 25th anniversary of his bringing forward this resolution. The gentleman from Maryland is someone who respects the traditions of this House and who, through his example, teaches younger and newer Members to also respect the traditions of this House. I am proud to support this resolution today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 119. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,9635,9635,9702,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [house] [pages h1773-h1774] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] authorizing use of capitol grounds for greater washington soap box derby mr. curbelo of florida. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (h. con. res. 119) authorizing the use of the capitol grounds for the greater washington soap box derby. the clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. the text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: h. con. res. 119 resolved by the house of representatives (the senate concurring), section 1. use of capitol grounds for soap box derby races.

FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1772-H1773] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SIDNEY OSLIN SMITH, JR. FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4618) to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 121 Spring Street SE in Gainesville, Georgia, as the ``Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4618 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SIDNEY OSLIN SMITH, JR. FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE. (a) Designation.--The Federal building and United States courthouse located at 121 Spring Street SE in Gainesville, Georgia, shall be known and designated as the ``Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the Federal building and United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4618. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4618 would designate the Federal building and United States Courthouse located at 121 Spring Street SE in Gainesville, Georgia, as the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Following his service in the United States Army during World War II, Judge Smith received his law degree and went into the private practice of law. In 1965, he was appointed to the Federal bench as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by President Johnson, and he served until his retirement in 1974. Given his commitment and dedication to our Nation and the law, I think it is fitting to recognize his service by naming this courthouse after him. I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for his leadership on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I also support H.R. 4618, which designates the United States Courthouse in Gainesville, Georgia, as the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Judge Smith served as a Federal district court judge in the Northern District of Georgia and was a World War II veteran. Judge Smith graduated from Harvard University and the University of Georgia Law School. After graduating from law school, Judge Smith went into private practice, as was noted, and he practiced until 1962, and was later elected as a superior court judge in Georgia. In 1965, Mr. Speaker, Judge Smith was appointed as a district court judge and was later elevated to chief judge. Judge Smith stepped down from the Federal bench in 1974, as was noted, and returned to private practice as a partner at an Atlanta law firm. In addition to his very long and distinguished career, Judge Smith was an active member of the educational community in Georgia, serving as chairman of the Gainesville Board of Education, the chairman of the State Board of Regents, and as a trustee of Brenau University for 35 years. Judge Smith was well respected in his community. It is very appropriate to name the building in Gainesville, Georgia, the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse. I also support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins). Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Florida for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4618, legislation that I introduced to name the Federal building and [[Page H1773]] United States Courthouse in Gainesville, Georgia, after Judge Sidney Oslin Smith, or Sidney Smith as we knew him. Judge Smith passed away, but his influence in my hometown of Gainesville is still felt. He was born and raised in Gainesville, and committed to the law and furthering education. Judge Smith dedicated his life to serving the public. He joined the Army during World War II to serve his country. He later went on to have a distinguished legal career after receiving his law degree from the University of Florida. He was in private practice in Gainesville for many years, and served as a superior court judge prior to being appointed to the Federal bench by President Lyndon Johnson. Judge Smith's appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia included time as chief judge from 1968 to 1974. {time} 1615 After leaving the bench, Judge Smith served the community in many other ways. He served on the board of Brenau College--now Brenau University--and played a pivotal role in helping the school to obtain university status and become a doctoral granting institution. Judge Smith's legacy is one that deserves to be honored. As the judge's son said, ``serving others was his vocational calling.'' The Federal building and courthouse in Gainesville is a symbol of public service and civic duty. Judge Smith dedicated his life to the high ideals of justice, honor, and family, and naming the courthouse after him will keep his legacy alive for years to come. It will serve as a reminder of the judge's commitment to his community, and I believe it will help inspire others to public service. Mr. Speaker, as we have just heard from my two friends and colleagues here about this man, Judge Smith, it goes beyond the resume, and it starts to talk, really, about the law degree and the private practice and the superior court judge. In fact, my father, who was a Georgia State trooper, remembers Judge Smith before he was on the Federal bench. I think what is most special for me in doing this and in working with my friends and fellow Senators from Georgia to name this building is not only did he do his service, but then he came back to the community. It was out of a duty that he served on the Federal bench. He then came back, once out of Federal practice, and he served in a law firm and helped in our educational community. Brenau University is known worldwide as a former women's college, but it has now expanded its program and reach to, literally, all across the world. It has recently expanded into China and has had an influence there and all over Georgia. It is also that commitment to business and that commitment to his hometown. You see, when we name buildings--and I don't take that lightly--it should be in honor of someone who touches all aspects, not just one's Federal service, not just, maybe, one's private service, but a combination of the two. When we go into high schools--and, Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues do as well. We speak in high schools and elementary schools all the time--we talk about pride; we talk about public service. Judge Smith is one of those in my community to whom we can point and say: Here is someone who served his country, who served his fellow members of Georgia as a member of the bar, but who was also known at home. They knew him in the restaurants; they knew him in the town square. He is someone we can look to and take pride in saying: There is someone who identifies with the very ideals of American life. For that reason, it is really easy for me to say this is something that we do in honor of someone who earned his honor while he was living. He earned it through his hard work, his dedication, and his commitment to his fellow man and to our beloved community in Gainesville. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to recognize Judge Smith by naming this building in Gainesville the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleagues for coming to the floor today in support of this legislation. Clearly, we are taking the opportunity--and the House has the opportunity before it--to honor a man who inspired his community, who served with honor, and who, quite frankly, was a role model to so many in the State of Georgia. I would respectfully ask all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4618. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1772-H1773] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SIDNEY OSLIN SMITH, JR.

Judge Smith's legacy is one that deserves to be honored. As the judge's son said, ``serving others was his vocational calling.'' The Federal building and courthouse in Gainesville is a symbol of public service and civic duty. Judge Smith dedicated his life to the high ideals of justice, honor, and family, and naming the courthouse after him will keep his legacy alive for years to come. It will serve as a reminder of the judge's commitment to his community, and I believe it will help inspire others to public service. Mr. Speaker, as we have just heard from my two friends and colleagues here about this man, Judge Smith, it goes beyond the resume, and it starts to talk, really, about the law degree and the private practice and the superior court judge. In fact, my father, who was a Georgia State trooper, remembers Judge Smith before he was on the Federal bench. I think what is most special for me in doing this and in working with my friends and fellow Senators from Georgia to name this building is not only did he do his service, but then he came back to the community. It was out of a duty that he served on the Federal bench. He then came back, once out of Federal practice, and he served in a law firm and helped in our educational community. Brenau University is known worldwide as a former women's college, but it has now expanded its program and reach to, literally, all across the world. It has recently expanded into China and has had an influence there and all over Georgia. It is also that commitment to business and that commitment to his hometown. You see, when we name buildings--and I don't take that lightly--it should be in honor of someone who touches all aspects, not just one's Federal service, not just, maybe, one's private service, but a combination of the two. When we go into high schools--and, Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues do as well. We speak in high schools and elementary schools all the time--we talk about pride; we talk about public service. Judge Smith is one of those in my community to whom we can point and say: Here is someone who served his country, who served his fellow members of Georgia as a member of the bar, but who was also known at home. They knew him in the restaurants; they knew him in the town square. He is someone we can look to and take pride in saying: There is someone who identifies with the very ideals of American life. For that reason, it is really easy for me to say this is something that we do in honor of someone who earned his honor while he was living. He earned it through his hard work, his dedication, and his commitment to his fellow man and to our beloved community in Gainesville. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to recognize Judge Smith by naming this building in Gainesville the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my colleagues for coming to the floor today in support of this legislation. Clearly, we are taking the opportunity--and the House has the opportunity before it--to honor a man who inspired his community, who served with honor, and who, quite frankly, was a role model to so many in the State of Georgia. I would respectfully ask all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4618. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1772-H1773] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SIDNEY OSLIN SMITH, JR. FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4618) to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 121 Spring Street SE in Gainesville, Georgia, as the ``Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4618 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SIDNEY OSLIN SMITH, JR. FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE. (a) Designation.--The Federal building and United States courthouse located at 121 Spring Street SE in Gainesville, Georgia, shall be known and designated as the ``Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the Federal building and United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4618. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4618 would designate the Federal building and United States Courthouse located at 121 Spring Street SE in Gainesville, Georgia, as the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Following his service in the United States Army during World War II, Judge Smith received his law degree and went into the private practice of law. In 1965, he was appointed to the Federal bench as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by President Johnson, and he served until his retirement in 1974. Given his commitment and dedication to our Nation and the law, I think it is fitting to recognize his service by naming this courthouse after him. I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for his leadership on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I also support H.R. 4618, which designates the United States Courthouse in Gainesville, Georgia, as the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Judge Smith served as a Federal district court judge in the Northern District of Georgia and was a World War II veteran. Judge Smith graduated from Harvard University and the University of Georgia Law School. After graduating from law school, Judge Smith went into private practice, as was noted, and he practiced until 1962, and was later elected as a superior court judge in Georgia. In 1965, Mr. Speaker, Judge Smith was appointed as a district court judge and was later elevated to chief judge. Judge Smith stepped down from the Federal bench in 1974, as was noted, and returned to private practice as a partner at an Atlanta law firm. In addition to his very long and distinguished career, Judge Smith was an active member of the educational community in Georgia, serving as chairman of the Gainesville Board of Education, the chairman of the State Board of Regents, and as a trustee of Brenau University for 35 years. Judge Smith was well respected in his community. It is very appropriate to name the building in Gainesville, Georgia, the Sidney Oslin Smith, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse. I also support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins). Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Florida for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4618, legislation that I introduced to name the Federal building and [[Page H1773]] United States Courthouse in Gainesville, Georgia, after Judge Sidney Oslin Smith, or Sidney Smith as we knew him. Judge Smith passed away, but his influence in my hometown of Gainesville is still felt. He was born and raised in Gainesville, and committed to the law and furthering education. Judge Smith dedicated his life to serving the public. He joined the Army during World War II to serve his country. He later went on to have a distinguished legal career after receiving his law degree from the University of Florida. He was in private practice in Gainesville for many years, and served as a superior court judge prior to being appointed to the Federal bench by President Lyndon Johnson. Judge Smith's appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia included time as chief judge from 1968 to 1974. {time} 1615 After leaving the bench, Judge Smith served the community in many other ways.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4570) to amend the Department of Agriculture program for research and extension grants to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to redesignate the program as the ``Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4570 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``100 Years of Women in Congress Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The first woman elected to Congress, Representative Jeannette Rankin from Montana, was elected on November 7, 1916, almost four years prior to ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right to vote. (2) Jeannette Rankin was not only a pioneer in national electoral politics, she was also a pioneer as a woman in science, graduating from the University of Montana in 1902 with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology. (3) 100 years after the election of Jeannette Rankin, 108 women serve in the 114th Congress, more than at any other time in our Nation's history. While this improvement is commendable, women hold only 20 percent of the seats in Congress, far below their relative share of the American electorate. (4) According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. workforce. Gains have been made in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields over time, but women still comprise only 39 percent of chemists and material scientists, 28 percent of environmental scientists and [[Page H1775]] geoscientists, 16 percent of chemical engineers, and 12 percent of civil engineers. (5) More must be done to encourage women to run for elected office and to enter STEM fields. SEC. 3. JEANNETTE RANKIN WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN STEM FIELDS PROGRAM. Paragraph (7) of section 1672(d) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5925(d)(7)) is amended to read as follows: ``(7) Jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields program.--Research and extension grants may be made under this section to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, with priority given to eligible institutions that carry out continuing programs funded by the Secretary. Any grant made under this paragraph shall be known and designated as a `Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program Grant'.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4570, the 100 Years of Women in Congress Act. This legislation would honor a true pioneer of American politics by naming an important agricultural research program as the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program. This competitive research grants program is designed to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I can think of no better person to identify with this important program than former Representative Rankin, who was the first woman to serve in the United States House of Representatives, an achievement made even more significant by the fact that Ms. Rankin was elected to Congress several years prior to the ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DelBENE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 4570, the 100 Years of Women in Congress Act. This is bipartisan legislation on a topic that is critical for our country and personally important to me. This legislation would honor the first woman elected to Congress in 1916, Jeannette Rankin, by renaming USDA's Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program as the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Grant Program. Jeannette Rankin graduated with a degree in biology long before it was common for women to be scientists, and she was elected to Congress before women had the right to vote. As a fellow Pacific northwesterner, she continues to be an inspiration today. There is no doubt that we need more women, especially more women leaders, in STEM fields. The year I graduated from college, women received 37 percent of the computer sciences degrees. Today it is below 20 percent. One explanation for this is that, in the early days of PCs, computers were seen as toys and were marketed heavily to boys, not girls. Eventually, young women considered computer science and showed up on college campuses and found themselves alone in computer science classrooms dominated by men. Before Congress, I had a long career in the technology sector and worked with a lot of developers in the early days of email, so I know what it is like to be the only woman in the room. Thankfully, I had a strong female role model, my mother, who showed my sisters and me that we could do anything we wanted in our careers. So I know firsthand how important it is that our kids develop the skills they need to have bright futures and help make sure the United States remains a leader in technology and innovation. Children, especially young women, need more role models like Jeannette Rankin so they can see themselves in STEM fields. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a brief moment to thank my colleague, Ms. DelBene, for her kind comments and for helping to ensure that this great bill is going to make it through with a very bipartisan majority. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from the great State of Montana (Mr. Zinke), my colleague who is one of the most courageous Members of Congress, somebody who served our Nation in our U.S. military for many years and deserves our thanks. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the women of Montana to advocate for renaming the Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Grant Program to honor former Montana Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin. Yes, I do hold her seat and, yes, she held the first seat in Montana before women could vote. I would like to also say that she was a true Montanan. She embodied the pioneer spirit that we know and love. She led the way in so many different areas to include: She was one of the first to graduate from the University of Montana with a degree in biology. She voted against both wars because she could not fight. Her spirit blazoned the trails and gave us leadership. She was also a gifted scientific mind and an early pioneer. The grant program is an important tool for young women today to continue their education in STEM and possibly break new ground, like Jeannette Rankin, and blaze new trails for young women of tomorrow, today, and our future. I would like to add that my own staffer, Ms. Jocelyn Galt, is a relative of Jeannette Rankin. She, too, demonstrates the tenacity and determination that made Jeannette Rankin successful and feared among her peers. Renaming this program in Representative Rankin's honor is the right thing to do because it a reminder of those who had courage to break down the barriers, had the tenacity to not let go of their dreams, and the courage to be a mentor and an inspiration to us all. I am happy to partner with Representative Grace Meng on this important endeavor. I thank her for her leadership. Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng), the sponsor of this legislation. Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to be here today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women serving in Congress. Thank you for allowing this legislation to come to the floor. I also thank my friend and colleague, Representative Zinke, for offering this legislation with me. His support has been instrumental in ensuring the consideration of this bill, and I am deeply grateful to him. A hundred years ago this November, the people of Montana elected Jeannette Rankin to the United States House of Representatives. She was the first woman elected to Congress and was elected before passage of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer her entire life. In 1902, she graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in biology. Afterward, she would become active in the women's suffrage movement, moving to New York City and assisting in the founding of the New York Woman Suffrage Party and working for the National American Woman Suffrage Party. She would return to Montana and was elected to office in the congressional election of 1916. Upon winning, she declared: ``I may be the first woman Member of Congress, but I won't be the last.'' I am happy to say she was right. [[Page H1776]] In recognition of Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin's many accomplishments and in celebration of the centennial anniversary of her election to Congress, Representative Zinke and I introduced the 100 Years of Women in Congress Act. Because Jeannette Rankin was a woman of science more than 100 years before our current push to have more women enter STEM fields, we felt it appropriate to rename the Department of Agriculture's Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Grant Program after her. This program currently supports collaborative research projects at institutions of higher education, which seek to increase the participation of women and minorities from rural areas in STEM fields. It will continue to do so into the future, but now it will also recognize the many contributions Jeannette Rankin made to American life. Mr. Speaker, thank you again for allowing this legislation to come to the floor today, and I thank Congressman Zinke for partnering with me on it. I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me and all of us here in support of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it has been 100 years since the first woman was elected to serve in this great institution, and now I am blessed to serve with so many great women on both sides of the aisle. This is a recognition that is long overdue. I urge all of my colleagues, along with those you have already heard today, to support this important piece of legislation to give Ms. Rankin the respect and the honor that she deserves when she walked here 100 years ago. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4570, the ``100 Years of Women in Congress Act,'' which renames the existing Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program, or WAMS program, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as the ``Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program.'' I commend Congresswoman Meng and Congressman Zinke for introducing this bipartisan legislation which: Highlights the importance and contributions of women Members in Congress; Recognizes the importance of the Suffragette Movement in achieving opportunities for women; Emphasizes the imperative of promoting education for women in STEM; and Affirms our nation's commitment to expanding opportunities for rural women in my home state of Texas and across the country. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first woman being elected to Congress, Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana. This bill is a fitting way to honor Representative Rankin's legacy, and to celebrate the many contributions of the female lawmakers who have succeeded her in this institution. Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer who broke barriers throughout her lifetime and whose example continues to inspire women the world over. She graduated from the University of Montana with a biology degree in 1902. She later became active in the women's suffrage movement, organizing the New York Women's Suffrage Party and working for the National American Woman Suffrage Association. In 1916, Representative Rankin became the first woman elected to Congress, even before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed the right to vote to women. For all of her contributions to women's rights, to political activism, and to this institution, it is only fitting to pay tribute to her achievements. The USDA WAMS program was created specifically to encourage women and minorities from rural areas to participate in research and projects in the sciences. Women and minorities have been and continue to be underrepresented in STEM fields. Although women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. labor force, they comprise only 36 percent of the computing workforce, 24 percent of the engineering workforce, and 18 percent of the advanced manufacturing workforce. Indeed, minority representation in STEM fields is even lower, with African-American and Latino workers comprising 29 percent of the general workforce, but only 15 percent of the computing workforce, 12 percent of the engineering workforce, and 6 percent of the advanced manufacturing workforce. The WAMS program is one way that we can address these glaring disparities. WAMS grants are awarded to universities and institutions of higher learning to distribute to eligible applicants, and they prioritize projects and programs of particular relevance to USDA. Recipient institutions have used WAMS grants for worthy endeavors, such as: establishing a WAMS fellowship program for women and minority high school students in rural areas; providing mentorship and hands-on, service-based learning to high school students and undergraduates in particular STEM fields; and offering mentoring services to current undergraduates to help them successfully complete STEM-based degrees. Because Representative Rankin is a graduate of the sciences from a rural area, renaming the WAMS program as the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program is the perfect way to honor her legacy as a woman of the sciences and the first woman elected to Congress, and to encourage the next generation of women and minorities from rural areas to take up STEM fields. I join my colleagues in support of this important measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4570. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1774-H1776] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1630 100 YEARS OF WOMEN IN CONGRESS ACT Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4570) to amend the Department of Agriculture program for research and extension grants to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to redesignate the program as the ``Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 4570 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``100 Years of Women in Congress Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The first woman elected to Congress, Representative Jeannette Rankin from Montana, was elected on November 7, 1916, almost four years prior to ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right to vote. (2) Jeannette Rankin was not only a pioneer in national electoral politics, she was also a pioneer as a woman in science, graduating from the University of Montana in 1902 with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology. (3) 100 years after the election of Jeannette Rankin, 108 women serve in the 114th Congress, more than at any other time in our Nation's history. While this improvement is commendable, women hold only 20 percent of the seats in Congress, far below their relative share of the American electorate. (4) According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. workforce. Gains have been made in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields over time, but women still comprise only 39 percent of chemists and material scientists, 28 percent of environmental scientists and [[Page H1775]] geoscientists, 16 percent of chemical engineers, and 12 percent of civil engineers. (5) More must be done to encourage women to run for elected office and to enter STEM fields. SEC. 3. JEANNETTE RANKIN WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN STEM FIELDS PROGRAM. Paragraph (7) of section 1672(d) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5925(d)(7)) is amended to read as follows: ``(7) Jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields program.--Research and extension grants may be made under this section to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, with priority given to eligible institutions that carry out continuing programs funded by the Secretary. Any grant made under this paragraph shall be known and designated as a `Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program Grant'.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4570, the 100 Years of Women in Congress Act. This legislation would honor a true pioneer of American politics by naming an important agricultural research program as the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program. This competitive research grants program is designed to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I can think of no better person to identify with this important program than former Representative Rankin, who was the first woman to serve in the United States House of Representatives, an achievement made even more significant by the fact that Ms. Rankin was elected to Congress several years prior to the ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DelBENE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 4570, the 100 Years of Women in Congress Act. This is bipartisan legislation on a topic that is critical for our country and personally important to me. This legislation would honor the first woman elected to Congress in 1916, Jeannette Rankin, by renaming USDA's Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program as the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Grant Program. Jeannette Rankin graduated with a degree in biology long before it was common for women to be scientists, and she was elected to Congress before women had the right to vote. As a fellow Pacific northwesterner, she continues to be an inspiration today. There is no doubt that we need more women, especially more women leaders, in STEM fields. The year I graduated from college, women received 37 percent of the computer sciences degrees. Today it is below 20 percent. One explanation for this is that, in the early days of PCs, computers were seen as toys and were marketed heavily to boys, not girls. Eventually, young women considered computer science and showed up on college campuses and found themselves alone in computer science classrooms dominated by men. Before Congress, I had a long career in the technology sector and worked with a lot of developers in the early days of email, so I know what it is like to be the only woman in the room. Thankfully, I had a strong female role model, my mother, who showed my sisters and me that we could do anything we wanted in our careers. So I know firsthand how important it is that our kids develop the skills they need to have bright futures and help make sure the United States remains a leader in technology and innovation. Children, especially young women, need more role models like Jeannette Rankin so they can see themselves in STEM fields. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a brief moment to thank my colleague, Ms. DelBene, for her kind comments and for helping to ensure that this great bill is going to make it through with a very bipartisan majority. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from the great State of Montana (Mr. Zinke), my colleague who is one of the most courageous Members of Congress, somebody who served our Nation in our U.S. military for many years and deserves our thanks.

Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me and all of us here in support of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it has been 100 years since the first woman was elected to serve in this great institution, and now I am blessed to serve with so many great women on both sides of the aisle. This is a recognition that is long overdue. I urge all of my colleagues, along with those you have already heard today, to support this important piece of legislation to give Ms. Rankin the respect and the honor that she deserves when she walked here 100 years ago. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4570, the ``100 Years of Women in Congress Act,'' which renames the existing Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program, or WAMS program, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as the ``Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program.'' I commend Congresswoman Meng and Congressman Zinke for introducing this bipartisan legislation which: Highlights the importance and contributions of women Members in Congress; Recognizes the importance of the Suffragette Movement in achieving opportunities for women; Emphasizes the imperative of promoting education for women in STEM; and Affirms our nation's commitment to expanding opportunities for rural women in my home state of Texas and across the country. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first woman being elected to Congress, Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana. This bill is a fitting way to honor Representative Rankin's legacy, and to celebrate the many contributions of the female lawmakers who have succeeded her in this institution. Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer who broke barriers throughout her lifetime and whose example continues to inspire women the world over. She graduated from the University of Montana with a biology degree in 1902. She later became active in the women's suffrage movement, organizing the New York Women's Suffrage Party and working for the National American Woman Suffrage Association. In 1916, Representative Rankin became the first woman elected to Congress, even before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed the right to vote to women. For all of her contributions to women's rights, to political activism, and to this institution, it is only fitting to pay tribute to her achievements. The USDA WAMS program was created specifically to encourage women and minorities from rural areas to participate in research and projects in the sciences. Women and minorities have been and continue to be underrepresented in STEM fields. Although women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. labor force, they comprise only 36 percent of the computing workforce, 24 percent of the engineering workforce, and 18 percent of the advanced manufacturing workforce. Indeed, minority representation in STEM fields is even lower, with African-American and Latino workers comprising 29 percent of the general workforce, but only 15 percent of the computing workforce, 12 percent of the engineering workforce, and 6 percent of the advanced manufacturing workforce. The WAMS program is one way that we can address these glaring disparities. WAMS grants are awarded to universities and institutions of higher learning to distribute to eligible applicants, and they prioritize projects and programs of particular relevance to USDA. Recipient institutions have used WAMS grants for worthy endeavors, such as: establishing a WAMS fellowship program for women and minority high school students in rural areas; providing mentorship and hands-on, service-based learning to high school students and undergraduates in particular STEM fields; and offering mentoring services to current undergraduates to help them successfully complete STEM-based degrees. Because Representative Rankin is a graduate of the sciences from a rural area, renaming the WAMS program as the Jeannette Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program is the perfect way to honor her legacy as a woman of the sciences and the first woman elected to Congress, and to encourage the next generation of women and minorities from rural areas to take up STEM fields. I join my colleagues in support of this important measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4570. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,15995,15995,16062,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [house] [pages h1774-h1776] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1630 100 years of women in congress act mr. rodney davis of illinois. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 4570) to amend the department of agriculture program for research and extension grants to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to redesignate the program as the ``jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields program''. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 4570 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``100 years of women in congress act''. sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) the first woman elected to congress, representative jeannette rankin from montana, was elected on november 7, 1916, almost four years prior to ratification of the 19th amendment to the u.s. constitution giving women the right to vote. (2) jeannette rankin was not only a pioneer in national electoral politics, she was also a pioneer as a woman in science, graduating from the university of montana in 1902 with a bachelor of science degree in biology. (3) 100 years after the election of jeannette rankin, 108 women serve in the 114th congress, more than at any other time in our nation's history. while this improvement is commendable, women hold only 20 percent of the seats in congress, far below their relative share of the american electorate. (4) according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, women make up 47 percent of the total u.s. workforce. gains have been made in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) fields over time, but women still comprise only 39 percent of chemists and material scientists, 28 percent of environmental scientists and [[page h1775]] geoscientists, 16 percent of chemical engineers, and 12 percent of civil engineers. (5) more must be done to encourage women to run for elected office and to enter stem fields. sec. 3. jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields program. paragraph (7) of section 1672(d) of the food, agriculture, conservation, and trade act of 1990 (7 u.s.c. 5925(d)(7)) is amended to read as follows: ``(7) jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields program.--research and extension grants may be made under this section to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, with priority given to eligible institutions that carry out continuing programs funded by the secretary. any grant made under this paragraph shall be known and designated as a `jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields program grant'.''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from illinois (mr. rodney davis) and the gentlewoman from washington (ms. delbene) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from illinois. general leave mr. rodney davis of illinois. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from illinois? there was no objection. mr. rodney davis of illinois. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 4570, the 100 years of women in congress act. this legislation would honor a true pioneer of american politics by naming an important agricultural research program as the jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields program. this competitive research grants program is designed to increase participation by women and underrepresented minorities from rural areas in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. i can think of no better person to identify with this important program than former representative rankin, who was the first woman to serve in the united states house of representatives, an achievement made even more significant by the fact that ms. rankin was elected to congress several years prior to the ratification of the 19th amendment granting women the right to vote. i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. delbene. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i also rise in support of h.r. 4570, the 100 years of women in congress act. this is bipartisan legislation on a topic that is critical for our country and personally important to me. this legislation would honor the first woman elected to congress in 1916, jeannette rankin, by renaming usda's women and minorities in stem fields program as the jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields grant program. jeannette rankin graduated with a degree in biology long before it was common for women to be scientists, and she was elected to congress before women had the right to vote. as a fellow pacific northwesterner, she continues to be an inspiration today. there is no doubt that we need more women, especially more women leaders, in stem fields. the year i graduated from college, women received 37 percent of the computer sciences degrees. today it is below 20 percent. one explanation for this is that, in the early days of pcs, computers were seen as toys and were marketed heavily to boys, not girls. eventually, young women considered computer science and showed up on college campuses and found themselves alone in computer science classrooms dominated by men. before congress, i had a long career in the technology sector and worked with a lot of developers in the early days of email, so i know what it is like to be the only woman in the room. thankfully, i had a strong female role model, my mother, who showed my sisters and me that we could do anything we wanted in our careers. so i know firsthand how important it is that our kids develop the skills they need to have bright futures and help make sure the united states remains a leader in technology and innovation. children, especially young women, need more role models like jeannette rankin so they can see themselves in stem fields. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. rodney davis of illinois. mr. speaker, i would like to take a brief moment to thank my colleague, ms. delbene, for her kind comments and for helping to ensure that this great bill is going to make it through with a very bipartisan majority. i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from the great state of montana (mr. zinke), my colleague who is one of the most courageous members of congress, somebody who served our nation in our u.s. military for many years and deserves our thanks. mr. zinke. mr. speaker, i rise on behalf of the women of montana to advocate for renaming the women and minorities in stem fields grant program to honor former montana congresswoman jeannette rankin. yes, i do hold her seat and, yes, she held the first seat in montana before women could vote. i would like to also say that she was a true montanan. she embodied the pioneer spirit that we know and love. she led the way in so many different areas to include: she was one of the first to graduate from the university of montana with a degree in biology. she voted against both wars because she could not fight. her spirit blazoned the trails and gave us leadership. she was also a gifted scientific mind and an early pioneer. the grant program is an important tool for young women today to continue their education in stem and possibly break new ground, like jeannette rankin, and blaze new trails for young women of tomorrow, today, and our future. i would like to add that my own staffer, ms. jocelyn galt, is a relative of jeannette rankin. she, too, demonstrates the tenacity and determination that made jeannette rankin successful and feared among her peers. renaming this program in representative rankin's honor is the right thing to do because it a reminder of those who had courage to break down the barriers, had the tenacity to not let go of their dreams, and the courage to be a mentor and an inspiration to us all. i am happy to partner with representative grace meng on this important endeavor. i thank her for her leadership. ms. delbene. mr. speaker, i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from new york (ms. meng), the sponsor of this legislation. ms. meng. mr. speaker, i am so pleased to be here today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women serving in congress. thank you for allowing this legislation to come to the floor. i also thank my friend and colleague, representative zinke, for offering this legislation with me. his support has been instrumental in ensuring the consideration of this bill, and i am deeply grateful to him. a hundred years ago this november, the people of montana elected jeannette rankin to the united states house of representatives. she was the first woman elected to congress and was elected before passage of the 19th amendment, which granted women the right to vote. jeannette rankin was a trailblazer her entire life. in 1902, she graduated from the university of montana with a degree in biology. afterward, she would become active in the women's suffrage movement, moving to new york city and assisting in the founding of the new york woman suffrage party and working for the national american woman suffrage party. she would return to montana and was elected to office in the congressional election of 1916. upon winning, she declared: ``i may be the first woman member of congress, but i won't be the last.'' i am happy to say she was right. [[page h1776]] in recognition of congresswoman jeannette rankin's many accomplishments and in celebration of the centennial anniversary of her election to congress, representative zinke and i introduced the 100 years of women in congress act. because jeannette rankin was a woman of science more than 100 years before our current push to have more women enter stem fields, we felt it appropriate to rename the department of agriculture's women and minorities in stem fields grant program after her. this program currently supports collaborative research projects at institutions of higher education, which seek to increase the participation of women and minorities from rural areas in stem fields. it will continue to do so into the future, but now it will also recognize the many contributions jeannette rankin made to american life. mr. speaker, thank you again for allowing this legislation to come to the floor today, and i thank congressman zinke for partnering with me on it. i urge all of my colleagues to support this measure. mr. rodney davis of illinois. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. delbene. mr. speaker, i urge all members to join me and all of us here in support of this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. rodney davis of illinois. mr. speaker, it has been 100 years since the first woman was elected to serve in this great institution, and now i am blessed to serve with so many great women on both sides of the aisle. this is a recognition that is long overdue. i urge all of my colleagues, along with those you have already heard today, to support this important piece of legislation to give ms. rankin the respect and the honor that she deserves when she walked here 100 years ago. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 4570, the ``100 years of women in congress act,'' which renames the existing women and minorities in stem fields program, or wams program, through the u.s. department of agriculture, as the ``jeannette rankin women and minorities in stem fields program.'' i commend congresswoman meng and congressman zinke for introducing this bipartisan legislation which: highlights the importance and contributions of women members in congress;

Captain William Wylie Galt served in World War II and was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1945 for gallantry above and beyond the call of duty. [[Page H1777]] Galt manned a machinegun on a tank destroyer at the front of the assault force, staying at his post in the vehicle's turret and continuing to lead his men despite intense hostile fire. He was killed while manning his machinegun and, on February 1, 1945, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. He was just 24 years old. I am proud to have a member of the Galt family on my staff. Captain Galt and Captain Moran are an inspiration to every Montanan who was ever and will ever put on the uniform, myself included. Montana has a strong heritage of military service, with more veterans per capita than almost any other state in the Nation, to include our Indian nations. Both Captain Moran and Captain Galt received the Medal of Honor, this Nation's most distinguished honor, for displaying such personal bravery that went well beyond the call of duty.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Montana? There was no objection. Mr. ZINKE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 719 and my companion bill, H.R. 1521, to honor Montana Medal of Honor recipients Captain John E. Moran and Captain William Wylie Galt and rename the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Great Falls, Montana, in their honor. Captain John E. Moran served in the Philippine-American war and was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1910 for fearlessly leading a small body of troops under severe fire and through waist-deep water in the attack against the enemy. Captain William Wylie Galt served in World War II and was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1945 for gallantry above and beyond the call of duty. [[Page H1777]] Galt manned a machinegun on a tank destroyer at the front of the assault force, staying at his post in the vehicle's turret and continuing to lead his men despite intense hostile fire. He was killed while manning his machinegun and, on February 1, 1945, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. He was just 24 years old. I am proud to have a member of the Galt family on my staff. Captain Galt and Captain Moran are an inspiration to every Montanan who was ever and will ever put on the uniform, myself included. Montana has a strong heritage of military service, with more veterans per capita than almost any other state in the Nation, to include our Indian nations. Both Captain Moran and Captain Galt received the Medal of Honor, this Nation's most distinguished honor, for displaying such personal bravery that went well beyond the call of duty. As leaders, they deserve our respect and honor. Memorializing these two heroes by renaming the Armed Forces Reserve Center will provide a daily reminder to us all of the service and sacrifice these Montanans made to our country. I thank my friends, Senator Steve Daines and Senator Jon Tester, for seeing this important bill through the Senate. I am proud to see this issue to completion. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BORDALLO. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of the Montana congressional delegation's legislation to rename the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Great Falls, Montana, to the Captain John E. Moran and Captain William Wylie Galt Armed Forces Reserve Center. Captain Moran and Captain Galt were both awarded the Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest honor, for their bravery in combat during the Philippine-American war and World War II, respectively. The recognition they earned through the sacrifices that they and their families made will be memorialized appropriately at the facility. As the Congresswoman representing Guam here in Congress, I have a special appreciation for the service of our men and our women in uniform and their families. Having welcomed the Marines in 1944 after 3 years of brutal Japanese occupation during World War II, our island has a history of service and one that demonstrates an understanding of our role in the American community. {time} 1645 Guam, like Montana, ranks in the top percentile for the servicemembers and veterans per capita, and our National Guard consistently maintains a force that is among the largest per capita in the Nation, a fact I am always proud to highlight. I commend Congressman Zinke and Senators Tester and Daines for their work in recognizing the contributions of two of Montana's own. I am pleased to support this bill and look forward to continuing to work to ensure that our brave servicemembers get the recognitions they deserve and have earned. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I encourage passage of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Iowa? There was no objection. Mr. BLUM. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3866 introduced by Congressman Donald Norcross of New Jersey. H.R. 3866 designates the post office located at 1265 Hurffville Road in Deptford Township, New Jersey, as the First Lieutenant Salvatore S. Corma II Post Office Building. First Lieutenant Corma was an officer in the United States Army who gave his life while serving in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. Lieutenant Corma died on April 29, 2010, of wounds sustained from an improvised explosive device. This came only weeks after returning to Afghanistan from visiting his home on leave. Lieutenant Corma was a dedicated soldier, a dedication that was evident throughout his life. He began martial arts at just 3 years old and continued with it throughout high school and college, even winning the silver medal for tae kwon do at the Junior National Olympics. Lieutenant Corma was also an excellent student. He was on the honor roll from kindergarten through his senior year of high school. He was a 2008 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he was captain of the tae kwon do karate team. Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Corma was a dedicated friend and fellow soldier. According to his mother, he would call and check on his men every day while he was on leave. Once he even mailed them 300 energy drinks. His dedication continued through his death, a death that came far too soon. We will be forever grateful for the sacrifices First Lieutenant Salvatore Corma II made for his country. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill to name a post office to honor his life and his sacrifice. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 3866 to designate the facility of the United [[Page H1778]] States Postal Service located at 1265 Hurffville Road in Deptford Township, New Jersey, as the First Lieutenant Salvatore S. Corma II Post Office Building. Following his graduation from West Point in 2008, Salvatore Corma attained his Ranger badge, serving as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. First Lieutenant Corma was deployed to Afghanistan, where he served as a platoon leader. On April 29, 2010, First Lieutenant Corma tragically lost his life while marking an IED in Zabul, Afghanistan. As his company commander noted when recommending First Lieutenant Corma for a valor award, marking IEDs is usually a soldier task, yet Salvatore Corma displayed not only his bravery, but also his leadership in knowingly putting himself in danger rather than his men. As he once told his mother: ``You have to lead from the front. You can never lead from the back.'' First Lieutenant Corma's selfless leadership should be commended. His military awards include the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. Mr. Speaker, we all should be pleased to pass this bill to honor the valiant actions and steadfast leadership of First Lieutenant Salvatore Corma, who put the lives of others before his own. I urge passage of H.R. 3866. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross). This is his bill. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Norton for yielding. I also thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for leadership and support for bringing this bill to the floor. I take this opportunity to introduce you to a name that no one in this Chamber had likely ever known, but it is a name and a legacy you should know and you need to know. It is my honor to be the one to share it with you. It is one of the reasons why we stand here today enjoying the many freedoms that we sometimes take for granted. The name is Army First Lieutenant Salvatore Corma II of Deptford Township, New Jersey. Sal grew up in south Jersey and even attended karate class with my own children before receiving a nomination to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from West Point in 2008, and then it was on to Active Duty in the United States Army as a First Lieutenant in the Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Sal only stood 5 foot 6, but his leadership made him a towering figure among his fellow soldiers. It was that very leadership on that very dark day that stands out--far from the safety and security of his home in the south Jersey suburbs--in one of those most volatile places on the planet, Afghanistan. That day was April 29, 2010. Sal was leading his company when they spotted an IED, an improvised explosive device. Sal ordered his soldiers to back off. As they retreated, the IED detonated. It would take the life of Salvatore Corma. He was just 24 years old. Sal Corma is credited with saving as many as 17 of his fellow soldiers in that one heroic, selfless act. Many will tell you that Sal made history that day. We know he did, but it happens in ways that you will never know. Because of his heroism, those who survived that day will go on to protect the United States from threats and eliminate dangers around the world. Those soldiers will live on and continue to protect us. They continued the fight, carrying in their hearts the spirit of Sal Corma. They are all living tributes and a living history to his actions. Many of those soldiers will come home after service and start the American Dream of a family. That is something that was denied Sal. He will never get to marry or have kids, but his actions ensured that others will get that opportunity, all because of his valor. Sal Corma II is undeniably an American hero. What better way to pay tribute to his valor than with this legislation I present today, to rename the Deptford, New Jersey, post office as the First Lieutenant Salvatore S. Corma II Post Office Building. Like all of our Active Duty servicemembers and veterans, Sal deserved this honor in life, not just in death. It is our duty to preserve his legacy to remind our fellow citizens and the world of his bravery. So every person that crosses that threshold in Deptford will see the name. If they don't know it, I hope they will take a moment to read about his life and his legacy and what he did for us as a country. I respectfully ask for your unanimous support in my legislation to rename the Deptford post office the First Lieutenant Salvatore S. Corma II Post Office Building. {time} 1700 Ms. NORTON.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross). This is his bill. Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Norton for yielding. I also thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for leadership and support for bringing this bill to the floor. I take this opportunity to introduce you to a name that no one in this Chamber had likely ever known, but it is a name and a legacy you should know and you need to know. It is my honor to be the one to share it with you. It is one of the reasons why we stand here today enjoying the many freedoms that we sometimes take for granted. The name is Army First Lieutenant Salvatore Corma II of Deptford Township, New Jersey. Sal grew up in south Jersey and even attended karate class with my own children before receiving a nomination to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He graduated from West Point in 2008, and then it was on to Active Duty in the United States Army as a First Lieutenant in the Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Sal only stood 5 foot 6, but his leadership made him a towering figure among his fellow soldiers. It was that very leadership on that very dark day that stands out--far from the safety and security of his home in the south Jersey suburbs--in one of those most volatile places on the planet, Afghanistan. That day was April 29, 2010. Sal was leading his company when they spotted an IED, an improvised explosive device. Sal ordered his soldiers to back off. As they retreated, the IED detonated. It would take the life of Salvatore Corma. He was just 24 years old. Sal Corma is credited with saving as many as 17 of his fellow soldiers in that one heroic, selfless act. Many will tell you that Sal made history that day. We know he did, but it happens in ways that you will never know. Because of his heroism, those who survived that day will go on to protect the United States from threats and eliminate dangers around the world. Those soldiers will live on and continue to protect us. They continued the fight, carrying in their hearts the spirit of Sal Corma. They are all living tributes and a living history to his actions. Many of those soldiers will come home after service and start the American Dream of a family. That is something that was denied Sal. He will never get to marry or have kids, but his actions ensured that others will get that opportunity, all because of his valor. Sal Corma II is undeniably an American hero. What better way to pay tribute to his valor than with this legislation I present today, to rename the Deptford, New Jersey, post office as the First Lieutenant Salvatore S. Corma II Post Office Building. Like all of our Active Duty servicemembers and veterans, Sal deserved this honor in life, not just in death. It is our duty to preserve his legacy to remind our fellow citizens and the world of his bravery. So every person that crosses that threshold in Deptford will see the name. If they don't know it, I hope they will take a moment to read about his life and his legacy and what he did for us as a country. I respectfully ask for your unanimous support in my legislation to rename the Deptford post office the First Lieutenant Salvatore S. Corma II Post Office Building. {time} 1700 Ms. NORTON.

the post office located at 1265 hurffville road in deptford township, new jersey, as the first lieutenant salvatore s. corma ii post office building. first lieutenant corma was an officer in the united states army who gave his life while serving in afghanistan during operation enduring freedom. lieutenant corma died on april 29, 2010, of wounds sustained from an improvised explosive device. this came only weeks after returning to afghanistan from visiting his home on leave. lieutenant corma was a dedicated soldier, a dedication that was evident throughout his life. he began martial arts at just 3 years old and continued with it throughout high school and college, even winning the silver medal for tae kwon do at the junior national olympics. lieutenant corma was also an excellent student. he was on the honor roll from kindergarten through his senior year of high school. he was a 2008 graduate of the united states military academy at west point, where he was captain of the tae kwon do karate team. mr. speaker, lieutenant corma was a dedicated friend and fellow soldier. according to his mother, he would call and check on his men every day while he was on leave. once he even mailed them 300 energy drinks. his dedication continued through his death, a death that came far too soon. we will be forever grateful for the sacrifices first lieutenant salvatore corma ii made for his country. mr. speaker, i urge members to support this bill to name a post office to honor his life and his sacrifice. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield myself such

ranger badge, serving as a first lieutenant in the u.s. army's 82nd airborne division stationed at fort bragg, north carolina. first lieutenant corma was deployed to afghanistan, where he served as a platoon leader. on april 29, 2010, first lieutenant corma tragically lost his life while marking an ied in zabul, afghanistan. as his company commander noted when recommending first lieutenant corma for a valor award, marking ieds is usually a soldier task, yet salvatore corma displayed not only his bravery, but also his leadership in knowingly putting himself in danger rather than his men. as he once told his mother: ``you have to lead from the front. you can never lead from the back.'' first lieutenant corma's selfless leadership should be commended. his military awards include the bronze star and the purple heart. mr. speaker, we all should be pleased to pass this bill to honor the valiant actions and steadfast leadership of first lieutenant salvatore corma, who put the lives of

HAROLD GEORGE BENNETT POST OFFICE. (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 201 B Street in Perryville, Arkansas, shall be known and designated as the ``Harold George Bennett Post Office''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2928, introduced by Congressman French Hill of Arkansas. H.R. 2928 designates the post office located at 201 B Street in Perryville, Arkansas, as the Harold George Bennett Post Office. Sergeant Harold George Bennett enlisted in the United States Army in 1957, and he served heroically in Vietnam. He was taken prisoner in that country, and on June 25, 1965, he became one of the first prisoners of war killed in Vietnam. Sergeant Bennett fought courageously, thinking not of himself, but thinking first and foremost of his colleagues. I will ask my colleague and the sponsor of this bill, Representative French Hill, to share the incredible story of Sergeant Bennett; but for now, I urge Members to support this bill to name a post office after Sergeant Harold George Bennett. Mr. Speaker, hearing his story inspires bravery in all of us, and I am hopeful that permanently naming a post office in remembrance of his sacrifice will serve to inspire generations to come. I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H1779]] Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 2928, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 201 B Street in Perryville, Arkansas, as the Harold George Bennett Post Office. Born in Perryville, Arkansas, in 1940, Harold George Bennett followed in his father's footsteps by joining the Army. Sergeant Bennett served with the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions and volunteered to serve in Vietnam in 1964. During his deployment, Sergeant Bennett acted as infantry adviser to South Vietnam's 33rd Ranger Battalion. On December 29, 1964, Sergeant Bennet's unit was airlifted to Binh Gia, a village overrun by the Viet Cong. Upon landing, they were met by enemy forces and a firefight ensued. A selfless man, Sergeant Bennett called off two separate helicopter pilots who attempted to rescue him, refusing to put their lives in danger to save his. With his unit overrun by Viet Cong, Sergeant Bennett was captured. He demonstrated courage and tenacity by participating in hunger strikes and attempting three times to escape captivity. Tragically, following his third attempt, Sergeant Bennett was executed, becoming the first American POW to be put to death during the Vietnam war. Sergeant Bennett was posthumously awarded a Silver Star for his heroic actions, in addition to receiving a Prisoner of War Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, and a Purple Heart. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the great sacrifices Sergeant Harold George Bennett made for his country, as he selflessly and repeatedly put the lives of others before his own. I urge the passage of H.R. 2928. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill). Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of going to the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Vietnam war in Little Rock and to see all the hugs and emotion at that event. Truly, it was a tumultuous time in our world. It was so good to see the healing that those men and women experienced at that 50th anniversary. I looked at that table set for the POW/MIA ceremony, and, of course, I was thinking about Sergeant Harold George Bennett from Perryville, Arkansas. Sergeant Bennett was born on October 16, 1940, in Thornburg, Arkansas, a very small town outside the beautiful Ouachita National Forest. A graduate of Perryville High School, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1957. He served as an airborne infantryman with the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions--no finer units. He completed Special Forces training in 1963. From there, Sergeant Bennett volunteered to go to South Vietnam as a Special Forces adviser with the Military Assistance Command. On December 29, 1964, his unit was airlifted to a small village after it had been overrun by the Viet Cong. Upon landing, Sergeant Bennett's unit was confronted by enemy forces. Twice, he refused extraction by military helicopters, as he was concerned for the pilots' safety and wanted to continue the fight against the enemy. After a furious and courageous battle, Sergeant Bennett was taken prisoner by the Viet Cong. Like so many of his colleagues, he spent 179 days as a POW and attempted to escape three times at great risk. His captors executed him on June 25, 1965. Only 24 years old, Sergeant Bennett was the first American POW killed in Vietnam. And like so many other servicemen who lost their lives there, his remains have never returned home. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman such time as he may consume. Mr. HILL. After four decades, in 2004, Sergeant Bennett was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame at Fort Benning. In 2006, his family was presented with his Combat Infantryman's Badge, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Prisoner of War Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, and the Purple Heart. In 2010, Sergeant Bennett's family was presented with his Silver Star. Today, we honor Sergeant Bennett's heroism, bravery, and service by installing a permanent marker of his lasting contribution to his native State and to our Nation, both that he loved and served so ably. Duty, honor, and country--his example is one all Americans and Arkansans can admire, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

I urge the passage of H.R. 2928. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill). Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of going to the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Vietnam war in Little Rock and to see all the hugs and emotion at that event. Truly, it was a tumultuous time in our world. It was so good to see the healing that those men and women experienced at that 50th anniversary. I looked at that table set for the POW/MIA ceremony, and, of course, I was thinking about Sergeant Harold George Bennett from Perryville, Arkansas. Sergeant Bennett was born on October 16, 1940, in Thornburg, Arkansas, a very small town outside the beautiful Ouachita National Forest. A graduate of Perryville High School, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1957. He served as an airborne infantryman with the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions--no finer units. He completed Special Forces training in 1963. From there, Sergeant Bennett volunteered to go to South Vietnam as a Special Forces adviser with the Military Assistance Command. On December 29, 1964, his unit was airlifted to a small village after it had been overrun by the Viet Cong. Upon landing, Sergeant Bennett's unit was confronted by enemy forces. Twice, he refused extraction by military helicopters, as he was concerned for the pilots' safety and wanted to continue the fight against the enemy. After a furious and courageous battle, Sergeant Bennett was taken prisoner by the Viet Cong. Like so many of his colleagues, he spent 179 days as a POW and attempted to escape three times at great risk. His captors executed him on June 25, 1965. Only 24 years old, Sergeant Bennett was the first American POW killed in Vietnam. And like so many other servicemen who lost their lives there, his remains have never returned home. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman such time as he may consume. Mr. HILL. After four decades, in 2004, Sergeant Bennett was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame at Fort Benning. In 2006, his family was presented with his Combat Infantryman's Badge, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Prisoner of War Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, and the Purple Heart. In 2010, Sergeant Bennett's family was presented with his Silver Star. Today, we honor Sergeant Bennett's heroism, bravery, and service by installing a permanent marker of his lasting contribution to his native State and to our Nation, both that he loved and served so ably. Duty, honor, and country--his example is one all Americans and Arkansans can admire, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2928. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,7712,7712,7779,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [house] [pages h1778-h1779] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] harold george bennett post office mr. blum. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 2928) to designate the facility of the united states postal service located at 201 b street in perryville, arkansas, as the ``harold george bennett post office''. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2928 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. harold george bennett post office.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent of mine who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. The bill before us would designate the post office located at 615 6th Avenue SE in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as the Sgt. 1st Class Terryl L. Pasker Post Office Building. This bill pays tribute to the life of Sergeant First Class Pasker, who was, unfortunately, killed in Afghanistan in 2011. Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Pasker was born February 26, 1972, in Anamosa, Iowa, the son of David and Mary Pasker. He joined the Army in 1990, after graduating from Lisbon High School, transitioning to the National Guard in 1995. Sergeant Pasker served in Afghanistan in 2004 and 2005, deploying again in 2011 with the 334th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division. He served in Panjshir province, where he was responsible for maintaining electronic equipment and mentoring Afghan police and military leaders. Mr. Speaker, on July 9, 2011, Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker gave his last full measure of devotion to his country when he was killed at the age of 39 at a checkpoint, only days before the end of his combat tour. He is survived by his wife, Erica; his parents, Mary and David; his brother, Andrew; and his two sisters, Christine and Rebecca. His family told me that he always said he would rather be a sermon than preach one, a belief that I believe he exemplified throughout his life. Admired by his fellow soldiers, Pasker was known for his humility, his [[Page H1780]] sense of humor, and his willingness to selflessly serve others. Away from service, Terryl was a homebuilder, taught karate, and was active in his local church. During his life, he would remind others that freedom is not free. So, Mr. Speaker, as we honor the sacrifice of Sergeant First Class Pasker, I ask us to also remember the thousands of servicemembers who sacrifice their time, their relationships, and even their lives to protect the freedom of this great Nation. I urge Members to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4605, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 615 6th Avenue SE in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as the Sgt. 1st Class Terryl L.

In 1995, he joined the Iowa National Guard, deploying to Afghanistan from 2004 to 2005. Six years later, Sergeant First Class Pasker decided to return for a second deployment with the 34th Infantry Division. During this tour, he mentored Afghan police forces and military leadership. {time} 1715 Tragically, Sergeant First Class Pasker was killed at a checkpoint in Panjshir province on July 9, 2011, just days before he was to return home from his combat duty. He was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for his sacrifice. Sergeant First Class Pasker is remembered as an active member of his church, who taught karate and served as a mentor to many in his community. A diligent, hardworking carpenter and owner of a contracting business, Terryl Pasker had intended to return to his trade and start a family with his wife, Erica, whom he married in 2006. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize Sergeant First Class Terryl Pasker for the bravery, courage, and selflessness that he exhibited in his 20 years of honorable military service.

Madam Speaker, the predicate here is a belief in peace through strength, a belief that what we want to do is deter potential adversaries; and to do that, we certainly need to restore our capability in our Armed Forces, deterrence really being capability and will. Tonight I am focused in on the POSTURE Act. Of course, Madam Speaker, the coauthors and I, we certainly share deep concern for the entire joint force, but today we are particularly focused in on the land forces. [[Page H1783]] You will hear, across the evening here, five general points. They are: Number one, that the drawdown plan currently from the administration is planned to continue into 2018, for several more years here; and at the culmination of that, our land forces will actually be at pre-World War II levels. Given the very volatile, uncertain, ambiguous international environment that we live in, we believe, the authors, that this is very high risk; and, really, we want to change that and, essentially, preserve 67,000 troops in end strength in the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps. That is number one. The second point is the assumptions that were made, Madam Speaker, when the administration initially made the decision on the drawdown, we believe that those assumptions are no longer valid. There has been much change in the world in the last several years, and you will hear some of that this evening. The third point, which is very important, is that, with our land forces, this is not like a light switch where we can turn it on, turn it off, turn it back on. If we end up standing down these 67,000 troops, it could take 3 to 4 years to reconstitute that force level; and given the uncertainty we have in this international environment, we think that that is too much risk for us to take on. Madam Speaker, the fourth point, and here I will speak from my personal experience of 29 years in the military, is that this planned drawdown also has consequence for our servicemen and -women. It has, certainly, consequence in terms of the op tempo, the operational tempo, of how many deployments they will go on and for how long, the duration of those deployments. And also, we know the risk. The enemy's weapon of choice in this war is the improvised explosive device, and we know that that has led to significant challenge with traumatic brain injuries and also post- traumatic stress. Certainly, there is wide bipartisan support in this Chamber to care for our servicemen and -women and their families, and that is why these bipartisan authors are also very concerned about end strength. That is point 4. The fifth point is this: when we preserve this--because I believe we are gaining momentum and, ultimately, I like our chances; we are going to get this into law--it is very important that this end strength come with the necessary resources so that we do not hollow out this force. So, Madam Speaker, we are going to have a series of speakers now, my coauthors on the bill. I want to begin with my original coauthor, and he is the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in this Chamber. He is a great American hero, Tim Walz. He is a Democrat from Minnesota. In 1989, he earned the title of Nebraska Citizen Soldier of the Year. After deployment to Italy with his Guard unit, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Sergeant Major Walz retired from the Army National Guard and resumed teaching as a geography teacher and a football coach at Mankato West Senior High School. He is a member of the Armed Services Committee, and he is also a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), my good colleague and friend. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York. It is a phrase we sometimes throw around in here without a lot of authenticity behind it, but I can tell you, in this case, a gentleman who served this Nation three decades in uniform and has had a distinguished career here in Congress, I am proud to stand with you. I think you heard the gentleman's comments on why we think now is not the right time to draw down this land force, and I say that with both of us coming out of that force. The size of the force this Nation needs should not be predicated by a plan that is outdated. Since the time this plan was written and put into effect: the rise of ISIS, China has built a new island in the South China Sea and is landing aircraft on it now, and a belligerent Russia. But more than that, we have seen the use of the military force as a deterrent, not just to aggression. We have seen it as a peaceful use, whether it be in Haiti to respond to natural disasters or to respond to Ebola in West Africa. The best trained, the most efficient and the most ready force to be able to use our diplomacy and our humanitarian assets is this land force. I think for many of us, we were concerned about this, but this is not ideologically driven. The gentleman and I coauthored a piece of legislation that created the National Commission on the Future of the Army. We said: Let's let the data speak for itself. If the experts can take this in and assess that this force is enough to do what needs to be done according to the strategic plan of this Nation by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the best thinkers, then that is the way it should be. But they did not come back with that. They came about some alarming things that they talked about, and one of them, I think it is very clear we are heading down the wrong path, stripping it of manpower. There is a belief in this Nation that we can solve all problems, especially security problems, with the use of technology. Our technological advantage is a huge positive force, but it will not be on the ground with Ebola. It will not be there when we have to have that defending force. {time} 1915 As everyone in this Chamber knows, 15 years of war puts an incredible stress on that. The gentleman used a great analogy. He talked about turning on and off the lights. I use the one that I think a lot of people think: This is like running the car out of gas. If we just need more, we will put more gas in it. That is not true. It is running the car out of oil, which causes all kinds of problems. If we do not keep the force where it is at, keep it trained, and keep it ready to go, we will not be able to carry out those missions. I would like to highlight a couple of other things that the Commission said about the integration of the National Guard to the active components and the use of the National Guard as an operational reserve, not a strategic reserve. Those of us who lived through the years where the National Guard was an afterthought and we practiced artillery training with toilet paper rolls instead of real charges because we didn't have the capacity to train, that is the surest way to make sure our force is not ready to go. It is not a good use of taxpayer dollars, and it is simply immoral to train America's young warriors without the full capacity of what they need. So I think, for many of us, this is not only a national security issue, it is a smart fiscal issue. We have paid dearly with treasure and blood to have this force. I can tell you, if the force shrinks too much--and we have seen this happen--the rotations happen very quickly. All the speakers you are going to hear tonight, Madam Speaker, are going to tell you about this. It becomes very difficult both from the personal side for them to manage their relationships, but also the professional side of soldiering. You can't get to the schools you need. You can't develop the wider breadth that you need for all contingencies. We have become very, very good at small missions that the same people get rotated into without the ability to look elsewhere. So as we pivot to the Pacific, those are new skill sets that need to be incorporated in. What the gentleman is asking for is let's just pause in the drawdown, let's keep the force where the Commission and the GAO says it needs to be, let's give the force the ability to rotate out and to do what needs to be done to have them get back and ready to get in the fight again in a way that makes sense. We can do that. Again, I want to be very clear. Those critics who say that we are asking to build up the military, we are just asking to stop a drawdown that we think gets dangerously close to putting this Nation in a predicament where it cannot carry out the missions that are asked of it. We in this Chamber and the American public have a moral responsibility to never put a warrior in that position and never put those commanders in that position. So I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this forward. I want to thank him for being willing to champion this forward. We know this is about educating not only our colleagues, but the [[Page H1784]] American public. It is about having a debate. I think the gentleman from New York brought up a critical point. Numbers without the ability to train, equip, and do what is necessary to get them to the highest level of readiness is probably worse than nothing, and that is not what we are asking for. I think, again, to highlight the gentleman's commitment to this, he is looking at ways to pay for it. He is looking at ways to make it work: repealing sequestration, pursuing waste, eliminating programs at the Pentagon, encouraging and assisting our allies and partners to beef up what they need to do to beef up, and ensure the next President has the force capable to not only address current, but future threats. That is our responsibility. So I am proud to stand with the gentleman on the POSTURE Act. I think it is smart policy. It is predicated on data. It is predicated on decades of personal experience from the gentleman from New York and speakers you are going to hear coming up. It is what the thinkers are telling us. Again, I think it does come back to the gentleman's opening comments. Those adversaries who think that this is the time to do something with this Nation need to be sent a strong message that we are as strong as ever, our commitment is as strong as ever, and our force will be as it always has been: the best trained and the best fighting force the world has ever seen. We are just asking to give them the numbers to do their job. So, Madam Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to take a look at this, to get on board, and to talk with the gentleman, myself, and the other cosponsors of this. Let's put that next President in a position to be able to secure this Nation, to be able to forward project American power in the name of humanitarian or human rights, and continue to give our young warriors what they need. Mr. GIBSON. I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker, you just heard, I think, in really compelling terms and you saw witness to why it is that we have the finest fighting force in the world. What separates us from the rest of the world is our noncommissioned officer corps. This is an incredible collection of professionals that provide advice, analysis, and recommendations. Really, I would put our noncommissioned officer corps up against any other noncommissioned officer corps in the world. I want to say, beyond that, he is a phenomenal Representative here in the U.S. House. I want to thank the gentleman for that tremendous testimony and for his great leadership. I now want to turn to another great warrior, Representative Steve Russell. Steve Russell is, Madam Speaker, an Airborne Ranger. He has served in airborne, light, and mechanized infantry assignments. His deployments include deployment to Kosovo, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Madam Speaker, in 2003, then-Lieutenant Colonel Steve Russell commanded the task force in Iraq that was instrumental in the hunt and capture of Saddam Hussein. He is in his first term. He is already off to an amazing start. He is a member of the Armed Services Committee. I yield to the gentleman from the State of Oklahoma, Mr. Steve Russell. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my brother, combat infantryman, warrior, and colleague from New York (Mr. Gibson) for his leadership in this effort. Madam Speaker, in 1940, our Nation faced tough decisions. Lawmakers in this Chamber debated over our constitutional requirement to defend our Republic. Faced with a decade of depression, declining budgets, and enormous domestic needs, President Roosevelt recognized that the Nation was woefully unprepared to defend herself, given the alarming developments in Asia and Europe the previous 2 years. Congress acted, and, although assured we could stay out of the war, this body passed the unprecedented Selective Service Act of 1940 to increase our defensive posture. While some would call it prescient or even timely, we were still woefully unprepared for the horrific attacks on our naval, land, and air forces in 1941. When the blow fell, we had for the first time a sizeable forward-deployed force based in the Philippine Islands in December 1941. That Allied force of 150,000 soldiers fought bravely for 5 months until their medical supplies, food, and, finally, ammunition were exhausted, prompting the largest surrender of U.S. forces in American history. Tens of thousands of these Allied soldiers died in brutal captivity, all simply because our Nation could not get to them. While we had future capacity, we had forfeited our defensive posture through cost- cutting policies the previous decade and we had exhausted our time. As unprepared as we were in 1940, it could have been even worse had the President and Congress not acted when they did. But here is something to ponder: our current land forces are actually 30 percent smaller today than they were in 1940 when you compare them to a percentage of our per capita population. If we lived today in an atmosphere of peace, maybe we could take such gambles. Instead, we see Russians reigniting the cold war, Iranians destabilizing the Middle East, North Koreans firing nuclear missiles with the aim to range the United States, and Islamic jihadist death- cult extremists committing acts of barbarity akin to the Middle Ages. We also see tensions rising with our trading partner, China, and the seeds of potential unrest in the Pacific. What does the President and this Congress intend to do if we do not act to prepare for this dangerous world? This year it would cut the United States Army by 30,000 more soldiers and our Marines by another 8,000. Instead, our bipartisan answer to these cuts in this Congress is a resounding no. Whatever savings we might imagine we safeguard, whatever tension we may imagine we could trim, whatever goodwill we deceive ourselves of that would go after, we assuredly would be eroded by an unexpected attack on our Nation as she has voluntarily chained herself down into a weakened condition. Rather than slacken our posture, we must slacken our chains. We stand together with much work ahead, but this bipartisan effort is a refusal to see our Nation further diminished. As we pass this measure into law, let's do it with the echo of these sobering words from novelist, historian, and Nobel Laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a survivor of torture and tyranny: I would like to call upon America to be more careful with its trust and prevent those who because of shortsightedness and still others out of self-interest from falsely using the struggle for peace and for social justice to lead you down a false road. Because they are trying to weaken you. They are trying to disarm your strong and magnificent country in the face of this fearful threat. I call upon you ordinary working men of America. Do not let yourselves become weak. Pass the POSTURE Act and prevent some horrific blow from berthing in our future. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibson for his outstanding leadership on this issue. Mr. GIBSON. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell). What we heard, Madam Speaker, just moments ago here is what I mentioned at the outset. We were talking about the changed assumptions when the administration first made these decisions. Of course, they were working based on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, the 2013 Strategic Choices and Management Review, and also the 2014 QDR. Madam Speaker, I think we just heard very persuasive argumentation how just in the last several years so much has changed and the reason why this Chamber is coming together in a bipartisan way to move forward on this POSTURE Act. Now, Madam Speaker, I want to turn to Representative Renee Ellmers. Renee is not on the Committee on Armed Services, but this lady works incredibly hard for our Nation and for our servicemen and -women. She studies all the time. I have had countless discussions with her. She is always wanting to know the details to make sure that the servicemen and -women who serve at Fort Bragg get all the resources that they need. She takes their combat readiness so very seriously because she knows that their lives are on the line there. [[Page H1785]] Fort Bragg could not ask for a stronger advocate. I am very impressed and am very thankful for her support in going above and beyond, not being on the committee and jurisdiction, to be here tonight and, really, to make her voice be heard all throughout this land on why we need to get behind the POSTURE Act. So I will just say last before I turn it over to her that part of what I know that Representative Ellmers is working on is a very important supporting element for our land forces, the 440th, which is based out of Fort Bragg and Pope Army Air Base. I know from firsthand experience this is an incredible outfit. We are concerned about some decisions that are being taken here. I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers) Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Gibson. I just want to start right off by saying, Madam Speaker, that our colleague, Mr. Gibson, has been a tireless voice for our military and certainly has been a resource for me and has always been more than open and honest with me when it comes to decisions that are facing our military and national security. Again, I just want to thank the gentleman for his service and, also, for coming to Washington to serve our country yet again, to be such an advocate for the military, and to be such a support for the rest of us who are trying to help in that capacity as well. I am here tonight to discuss in this Special Order the introduction of the POSTURE Act, and I thank the gentleman for this great piece of legislation. The POSTURE Act is an important piece of legislation that will prevent further troop reductions and improve military readiness. As the Representative of Fort Bragg based in North Carolina, I have the unique perspective to see how this troop drawdown is directly impacting our national security. It is my top priority to ensure that we restore our military's end strength not only to serve as a deterrent, but also so that our military can appropriately and effectively respond to any threat represented to our country or our allies. The POSTURE Act will ensure that our troops are ready and prepared to defend our Nation at a moment's notice. I would also like to thank Mr. Gibson for his help raising awareness about the serious issues facing Fort Bragg, including the deactivation of the 440th Airlift Wing. The 440th Airlift Wing provides unparalleled support to Fort Bragg paratroopers, more specifically, the famed 82nd Airborne's Global Response Force, a unit Mr. Gibson knows all too well, as he was the commander of this force just a few years back. Because of the potential deactivation of the 440th Airlift Wing, I have been having this very discussion about maintaining military readiness and maintaining sufficient troop levels for the last 2-plus years. This certainly is not the first time I have stepped foot onto the House floor to rail against the Air Force's ill-conceived decision to deactivate the 440th. In fact, I have stood in this very spot and stressed my concerns about the threats their decision poses to the readiness of the Fort Bragg paratroopers. Unfortunately, what I thought was going to happen is indeed taking place as we speak. While the Air Force has promised they would continue to provide necessary airlift support for Fort Bragg, the Air Force is already falling well short of this promise. {time} 1930 Fort Bragg aims to complete 10,000 jumps a month to prepare troops for combat, but the Air Force's decision to prematurely hollow out this wing has prevented them from meeting this jump goal. Last month, only 6,100 paratroopers jumped from Air Force planes. In fact, the Air Force has even fallen short on Fort Bragg's 8,000-jump minimum--a number they consider to be their threshold for proficiency. This is yet another consequence and, unfortunately, it is a concrete example of how drawdown can and will affect military readiness and training. Not only have I met with Fort Bragg leadership, but I have also met with our Nation's top military officials and still, to this day, I do not understand why the Air Force insists on making decisions based on zero strategic merit. To make matters worse, deactivation of the 440th is happening at a time when the 18th Airborne Corps was recently called upon to lead the fight against the Islamic extremist group ISIS. Members of the 18th Airborne Corps are set to deploy this summer. Meanwhile, we are on the track to have the smallest size Army since the end of World War II. Russia has become increasingly aggressive and China's military presence continues to grow in southeast Asia--all the while our President insists on drawing down our military and cutting its funding. This is not the time to be cutting our military. This is the time to strengthen it. Mr. Gibson's bill ensures that we will have appropriate end strength to keep our Nation and our allies safe and secure. I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Gibson and standing by him in this capacity, as I believe that strengthening our military is one of the most important issues facing Congress to date. Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I want to thank her for her strong voice, and I want to thank her for the attention to detail that she puts into this. This is so critically important. It is very instrumental in the momentum that we have had--your great voice, your staff's hard work, and your hard work. We are going to continue to push forward with this with the POSTURE Act, and continue to make sure that the entire installation at Fort Bragg has the necessary resources to deliver and to get its mission done and to look after and take care of its servicemen and -women, those paratroopers, and also the families. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). Representative Knight is also a veteran of our Armed Forces. He was born at Edwards Air Force Base in Antelope Valley, California. He served in the United States Army from 1985 to 1987. He was a track systems mechanic in Freiburg, Germany. When his tour ended, he served in the United States Army Reserve. His total military service spanned from 1985 to 1993. He is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Also, within his district, he has Air Force Plant 42 and the Edwards Air Force Base. Mr. KNIGHT. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibson for taking a leadership role in making sure that the military has a voice, and that is exactly what he has done in his tenure here in Congress. I rise in support of H.R. 4534. The POSTURE Act is not just something that we are asking for. It is basically the bare necessities. We are getting down to the limits. I can say, just on personal experience, when I enlisted in 1985 as a young person graduating high school and enlisting into the Army, I expected that we had such a great military and we had all of these things that were going to help me in my endeavors. As I went to Germany, my job was if something happened, if the Russians were going to come over, we were supposed to guard what was known as the Fulda Gap. I know that anyone who has ever served in the Army in the '80s knows what the Fulda Gap is. It was basically that line where we were going to stop the Russian Army. Unfortunately, they told us that we were going to be outrun about 11 to 1 at that time from the Russian Army. That is not something that an 18-year-old wants to know, is that the very first assignment that might happen in the cold war is you are going to go to a spot and you are going to be up against an 11-to-1 army. At that time, we had about 781,000 active Army folks. If we fast forward to today, we are sending people in rotations every 12 months or every 18 months. We are sending these people two, three, or four different rotations during their 4- or 6-year enlistments, and we have such a smaller active Army. I know that now folks out there will be talking about the total Army structure and the total structure. I think that is great that we have the Reserves and National Guard as part of the total structure. I believe in that. I think that is something that absolutely should happen. But if we are just doing apples to apples from 1986 to today, we go from about 780,000 to less than 500,000. That is getting down to a point where, can [[Page H1786]] we fight on two fronts, can we help, can we do all of the missions that the Army has done for the last 200 years? I would say that we are getting down to that point where if we don't pass the POSTURE Act, we will go underneath that level and we will not be able to send our warriors into combat and into humanitarian situations with our best effort, with our best foot forward. I would say that this is the absolute--the absolute--end to where we should draw down. Let's look at what we are looking at today. We are not looking at some of the larger countries, but we are also looking at rogue states. Russia and China, obviously, are out there and they are, obviously, doing things that we keep our eye on. Their technology has advanced, their amount of money that they spend on the military has jumped dramatically over the last 20 years. Some of the things that they are bringing forward are as technologically advanced as we have. I would say that if we went back 20 years, we would never say that. We would say technologically we are ahead every step of the way. Today we can't say that. Today we also have rogue nations and rogue leaders out there that want to do things to us and to our allies. So I say at a time where we are drawing down and continuing to draw down, where we have these types of rogue nations, where we have these types of superpowers out there, and we have these types of groups that want to do bad things to us and to our allies, is this actually the time that we should draw down to an unsafe level? I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for everything that he has done in his tenure here in Congress and what he has done for the United States of America because, honestly, he is a true hero. But in this regard, he is trying to unite all of Congress behind what he has believed and what he has done for his entire life. I think that Congress should listen, I think that Congress should say, yes, we absolutely have these levels, and we can't go below them. In fact, as we are watching everything that is happening on the news on a daily basis, we would say that maybe those levels are too low, too. So I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for his leadership. Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I thank him for his service to our Nation, and also thank him for his great work on the House Armed Services Committee. He is truly making a difference, and his voice here tonight is very compelling and very significant. Madam Speaker, I am now going to recap and move to close. I appreciate very much the time in a busy schedule and colleagues here tonight. We are here tonight, again, for H.R. 4534, the POSTURE Act, which stops the Obama administration's drawdown of our land forces--our Army and our Marine Corps. As I mentioned, this is a bipartisan bill--myself and 52 others here in this Chamber, including 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats, led so ably by Sergeant Major Retired Representative Tim Walz, a Democrat from Minnesota. I also want to say that Chairman Turner was not able to be here today, but he has been instrumental in not only help craft this, but actually help build support for it for these past several months. As I mentioned, Madam Speaker, tonight you heard five points why it is so important that we put the POSTURE Act into law and that we stop this drawdown. In the first point we gave some historical figures and some context of where we are today. We know that at present our land forces are about at the same size that we were on the 11th of September of 2001. Of course, during the surge, we saw a ramp-up of our land forces, and now we have seen a resetting of that where we are about at 11th of September of 2001 levels. However, the plan now from the administration is to continue that drawdown all the way down to pre-World War II levels. That would be done by 2018. That takes an additional 67,000 troops out of the formations. Madam Speaker, we heard, I think, some very significant testimony tonight from some of the speakers. We know that we have senior leaders in our Armed Forces now that have described this as a very serious risk, very significant risk. And you also heard from Representative Walz when he talked about the Commission on the Future of the Army, which Representative Walz, a humble man, was actually the author for that, the brain for that. We are here today because of his work on that score. The results of that commission, I believe, Madam Speaker, really need to be paid attention to. It was here that not only were we able to get a better understanding of this risk, but also we helped bring together all components of the Army--the regular Army, the National Guard, and the Army Reserve. The Commission on the Future of the Army helped. I also want to reinforce how important leadership is--our Chief of Staff of the Army, our Secretary of the Army, our Acting Secretary of the Army right now. They have put a major priority on really pulling together everyone that serves in the Army. The same goes for our Secretary of the Navy and for our Commandant of the Marine Corps because this is truly a team effort all the way across. That commission helped chart the way forward. Madam Speaker, the General Accounting Office, the GAO's report that came out just last week, documented what our research has also shown over these several months. That is that there is just too much risk in continuing this drawdown to pre-World War II levels. That was point one. In point two, we talked about the assumptions--we heard from all the speakers. Particularly, Mr. Russell focused in on that--how much of the world has changed. We can understand why the administration brought forward an argument back initially, but so much has changed since that time. It is clear to all of us that we need to pay attention to that and to adopt the POSTURE Act. We also pointed out this evening that this is not like a light switch. It is not something that we can turn on and turn off. If we decide to move forward with the 67,000 troops, taking them out of the formations, we know that we are looking at 3 to 4 years just to get back to where we are today, Madam Speaker. That would, I think, really signal to our potential adversaries the wrong message. The fourth point is--and we heard from a couple of the speakers--how important it is that we have the right size formations because that impacts on how often they get sent over into the combat zone and how long they stay. All of this has impacts on families, it has impacts on traumatic brain injury potential, and also posttraumatic stress. That is certainly something that this Chamber is absolutely unified in doing everything we can to support our servicemen and -women. By enacting the POSTURE Act, we are also supporting our currently serving members and our veterans. The last point--and this has been really made very clear to us by all the leadership in both the Army and the Marine Corps--is how important it is that by preserving this end strength, it has to come with the necessary resources so that they are manned, equipped, and trained, and that we look towards the modernization of the force and look towards the future. We have heard from the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO. The CBO initially assesses this at $600 million. We understand that there may be a new assessment coming forward shortly. But as was also mentioned by Sergeant Major Walz, Representative Walz, our committee is also very keenly going through the budget, a budget of over $600 billion, when you look at the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, the Overseas Contingency Fund. We are looking for ways to make sure we do this in the best way possible for the taxpayer. Madam Speaker, I include for the Record a series of letters of support that we are getting from the Association of the United States Army, the National Guard Association, and the Reserve Officers Association. We deeply appreciate their support. Association of the United States Army, Arlington, Virginia, 3 March 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Gibson: On behalf of the members of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA), I write to support your introduction of H.R. 4534, the ``Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End- [[Page H1787]] Strength Act of 2016'' or the ``POSTURE Act.'' At a time when our Army is confronting growing threats and increasing operational demands, it would be wise to pause the current budget-driven force reductions and allow the next administration time to assess land force capabilities and needs before determining troop levels, Under current plans, the Regular Army is expected to fall to 475,000 Soldiers by 1 October 2016, and then further decrease to 450,000 Soldiers by 1 October 2018. These same plans will also reduce the end strength of our Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. Such a reduction in our landpower capability does not make sense in a time of increased threats and global instability. While the POSTURE Act puts the brakes on budget-driven force reductions, the Army will also face negative consequences if the additional end strength is not funded. During a recent hearing on the Army's Fiscal Year 2017 budget, Army Chief of Staff GEN Mark Kinney told the Senate Appropriations Committee that stopping the drop in Army end strength without providing funding to cover the additional costs would undermine readiness and potentially result in a hollow Army. AUSA looks forward to working with you to advance the POSTURE Act, but urges you to consider ways to provide the additional resources to prepare our Army to face a dangerous and Increasingly unstable world. Sincerely, Gordon R. Sullivan, General, USA Retired. ____ National Guard Association of The United States, Inc. Washington, DC, February 26, 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. On behalf of the nearly 45,000 members of the National Guard Association of the United States and the approximately 450,000 soldiers and airmen of the National Guard, please accept our sincere thanks for your leadership in introducing the Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strength (POSTURE) Act of 2016 (H.R. 4534), a bill that would stop the drawdown of U.S. Land Forces. NGAUS strongly supports your legislation. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) recommended a minimally sufficient Total Army of 980,000 soldiers; however, it provided no optimal end-strength level. NGAUS testified before the NCFA that the Total Army was at the risk of becoming dangerously small given the current threat environment. Given the velocity of instability, the demand for U.S. Land Forces will likely only increase for the foreseeable future. U.S. Land Forces must be sized to address these threats without putting undue stress on our soldiers and marines. We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure this important legislation becomes law. Thank you, as always, for your continued support for members of the National Guard. Sincerely, Gus Hargett, Major General (Ret), USA, President. ____ Reserve Officers Association, 1 March 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Congressman Gibson: The Reserve Officers Association (ROA) supports your bill H.R. 4534, ``Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strength Act of 2016'' or the ``POSTURE Act.'' This bill recognizes the vital contributions of the Reserve Components and the need to ensure they have the right Fiscal Year 2016 end strength authorized. Since 9/11, more than 900,000 Reserve Component members have been activated to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and other contingencies. Despite increased use of the Guard and Reserve, the Congressional Research Service, identified end strength reductions between FY2001 and FY2015. ``Between FY2001 and FY2015, the largest shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the Navy Reserve (-31,600 or -35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-7,258 or -9.8%), and Coast Guard Reserve (-1,000 or -12.5%). A smaller change occurred in the Air National Guard (-3,022 or -2.8%) and Army Reserve (-3,300 or -1.6%), while the authorized end strength for the Army National Guard (-326 or -0.1%) and the Marine Corps Reserve (-358 or -0.9%) have been largely unchanged during this period, (FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues, R44120).'' As stated in the bill, passing this legislation will ensure Guard and Reserve members are available, ``. . . to deter threats, shape the international security 15 environment, respond to emergent situations and crises, and, if necessary, to fight and win the Nation's war, . . .'' ROA has a membership of 50,000, which represents all the uniformed services of the United States who would be favorably affected by your bill. Thank you for your efforts on this issue, and past support to the Military. Sincerely, Jeffrey E. Phillips, Executive Director. Mr. GIBSON. Lastly, Madam Speaker, the legislative strategy here is that we have been building out support. Our hope is that when the mark for the national security policy bill, which will be unveiled here in the next couple of weeks, that this bill will be included in the underlying bill because we think it is just so critically important that we get this done this year. Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to come together with my colleagues to talk about such an important issue for the American people. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1782-H1787] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] POTENTIAL DRAWDOWN OF LAND FORCES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gibson) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include supporting material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, tonight I am speaking to gain support for H.R. 4534. This is the POSTURE Act. It stops the administration's drawdown of our land forces, the United States Marine Corps and the United States Army. This is a bipartisan bill, myself and 52 others, 52 cosponsors, including 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats. I am proud to say that we are coming together to make sure that we keep our land forces strong. This is also a bicameral bill. The language of this bill has also been introduced in the United States Senate. Madam Speaker, the predicate here is a belief in peace through strength, a belief that what we want to do is deter potential adversaries; and to do that, we certainly need to restore our capability in our Armed Forces, deterrence really being capability and will. Tonight I am focused in on the POSTURE Act. Of course, Madam Speaker, the coauthors and I, we certainly share deep concern for the entire joint force, but today we are particularly focused in on the land forces. [[Page H1783]] You will hear, across the evening here, five general points. They are: Number one, that the drawdown plan currently from the administration is planned to continue into 2018, for several more years here; and at the culmination of that, our land forces will actually be at pre-World War II levels. Given the very volatile, uncertain, ambiguous international environment that we live in, we believe, the authors, that this is very high risk; and, really, we want to change that and, essentially, preserve 67,000 troops in end strength in the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps. That is number one. The second point is the assumptions that were made, Madam Speaker, when the administration initially made the decision on the drawdown, we believe that those assumptions are no longer valid. There has been much change in the world in the last several years, and you will hear some of that this evening. The third point, which is very important, is that, with our land forces, this is not like a light switch where we can turn it on, turn it off, turn it back on. If we end up standing down these 67,000 troops, it could take 3 to 4 years to reconstitute that force level; and given the uncertainty we have in this international environment, we think that that is too much risk for us to take on. Madam Speaker, the fourth point, and here I will speak from my personal experience of 29 years in the military, is that this planned drawdown also has consequence for our servicemen and -women. It has, certainly, consequence in terms of the op tempo, the operational tempo, of how many deployments they will go on and for how long, the duration of those deployments. And also, we know the risk. The enemy's weapon of choice in this war is the improvised explosive device, and we know that that has led to significant challenge with traumatic brain injuries and also post- traumatic stress. Certainly, there is wide bipartisan support in this Chamber to care for our servicemen and -women and their families, and that is why these bipartisan authors are also very concerned about end strength. That is point 4. The fifth point is this: when we preserve this--because I believe we are gaining momentum and, ultimately, I like our chances; we are going to get this into law--it is very important that this end strength come with the necessary resources so that we do not hollow out this force. So, Madam Speaker, we are going to have a series of speakers now, my coauthors on the bill. I want to begin with my original coauthor, and he is the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in this Chamber. He is a great American hero, Tim Walz. He is a Democrat from Minnesota. In 1989, he earned the title of Nebraska Citizen Soldier of the Year. After deployment to Italy with his Guard unit, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Sergeant Major Walz retired from the Army National Guard and resumed teaching as a geography teacher and a football coach at Mankato West Senior High School. He is a member of the Armed Services Committee, and he is also a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), my good colleague and friend. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York. It is a phrase we sometimes throw around in here without a lot of authenticity behind it, but I can tell you, in this case, a gentleman who served this Nation three decades in uniform and has had a distinguished career here in Congress, I am proud to stand with you. I think you heard the gentleman's comments on why we think now is not the right time to draw down this land force, and I say that with both of us coming out of that force. The size of the force this Nation needs should not be predicated by a plan that is outdated. Since the time this plan was written and put into effect: the rise of ISIS, China has built a new island in the South China Sea and is landing aircraft on it now, and a belligerent Russia. But more than that, we have seen the use of the military force as a deterrent, not just to aggression. We have seen it as a peaceful use, whether it be in Haiti to respond to natural disasters or to respond to Ebola in West Africa. The best trained, the most efficient and the most ready force to be able to use our diplomacy and our humanitarian assets is this land force. I think for many of us, we were concerned about this, but this is not ideologically driven. The gentleman and I coauthored a piece of legislation that created the National Commission on the Future of the Army. We said: Let's let the data speak for itself. If the experts can take this in and assess that this force is enough to do what needs to be done according to the strategic plan of this Nation by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the best thinkers, then that is the way it should be. But they did not come back with that. They came about some alarming things that they talked about, and one of them, I think it is very clear we are heading down the wrong path, stripping it of manpower. There is a belief in this Nation that we can solve all problems, especially security problems, with the use of technology. Our technological advantage is a huge positive force, but it will not be on the ground with Ebola. It will not be there when we have to have that defending force. {time} 1915 As everyone in this Chamber knows, 15 years of war puts an incredible stress on that. The gentleman used a great analogy. He talked about turning on and off the lights. I use the one that I think a lot of people think: This is like running the car out of gas. If we just need more, we will put more gas in it. That is not true. It is running the car out of oil, which causes all kinds of problems. If we do not keep the force where it is at, keep it trained, and keep it ready to go, we will not be able to carry out those missions. I would like to highlight a couple of other things that the Commission said about the integration of the National Guard to the active components and the use of the National Guard as an operational reserve, not a strategic reserve. Those of us who lived through the years where the National Guard was an afterthought and we practiced artillery training with toilet paper rolls instead of real charges because we didn't have the capacity to train, that is the surest way to make sure our force is not ready to go. It is not a good use of taxpayer dollars, and it is simply immoral to train America's young warriors without the full capacity of what they need. So I think, for many of us, this is not only a national security issue, it is a smart fiscal issue. We have paid dearly with treasure and blood to have this force. I can tell you, if the force shrinks too much--and we have seen this happen--the rotations happen very quickly. All the speakers you are going to hear tonight, Madam Speaker, are going to tell you about this. It becomes very difficult both from the personal side for them to manage their relationships, but also the professional side of soldiering. You can't get to the schools you need. You can't develop the wider breadth that you need for all contingencies. We have become very, very good at small missions that the same people get rotated into without the ability to look elsewhere. So as we pivot to the Pacific, those are new skill sets that need to be incorporated in. What the gentleman is asking for is let's just pause in the drawdown, let's keep the force where the Commission and the GAO says it needs to be, let's give the force the ability to rotate out and to do what needs to be done to have them get back and ready to get in the fight again in a way that makes sense. We can do that. Again, I want to be very clear. Those critics who say that we are asking to build up the military, we are just asking to stop a drawdown that we think gets dangerously close to putting this Nation in a predicament where it cannot carry out the missions that are asked of it. We in this Chamber and the American public have a moral responsibility to never put a warrior in that position and never put those commanders in that position. So I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this forward. I want to thank him for being willing to champion this forward. We know this is about educating not only our colleagues, but the [[Page H1784]] American public. It is about having a debate. I think the gentleman from New York brought up a critical point. Numbers without the ability to train, equip, and do what is necessary to get them to the highest level of readiness is probably worse than nothing, and that is not what we are asking for. I think, again, to highlight the gentleman's commitment to this, he is looking at ways to pay for it. He is looking at ways to make it work: repealing sequestration, pursuing waste, eliminating programs at the Pentagon, encouraging and assisting our allies and partners to beef up what they need to do to beef up, and ensure the next President has the force capable to not only address current, but future threats. That is our responsibility. So I am proud to stand with the gentleman on the POSTURE Act. I think it is smart policy. It is predicated on data. It is predicated on decades of personal experience from the gentleman from New York and speakers you are going to hear coming up. It is what the thinkers are telling us. Again, I think it does come back to the gentleman's opening comments. Those adversaries who think that this is the time to do something with this Nation need to be sent a strong message that we are as strong as ever, our commitment is as strong as ever, and our force will be as it always has been: the best trained and the best fighting force the world has ever seen. We are just asking to give them the numbers to do their job. So, Madam Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to take a look at this, to get on board, and to talk with the gentleman, myself, and the other cosponsors of this. Let's put that next President in a position to be able to secure this Nation, to be able to forward project American power in the name of humanitarian or human rights, and continue to give our young warriors what they need. Mr. GIBSON. I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker, you just heard, I think, in really compelling terms and you saw witness to why it is that we have the finest fighting force in the world. What separates us from the rest of the world is our noncommissioned officer corps. This is an incredible collection of professionals that provide advice, analysis, and recommendations. Really, I would put our noncommissioned officer corps up against any other noncommissioned officer corps in the world. I want to say, beyond that, he is a phenomenal Representative here in the U.S. House. I want to thank the gentleman for that tremendous testimony and for his great leadership. I now want to turn to another great warrior, Representative Steve Russell. Steve Russell is, Madam Speaker, an Airborne Ranger. He has served in airborne, light, and mechanized infantry assignments. His deployments include deployment to Kosovo, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Madam Speaker, in 2003, then-Lieutenant Colonel Steve Russell commanded the task force in Iraq that was instrumental in the hunt and capture of Saddam Hussein. He is in his first term. He is already off to an amazing start. He is a member of the Armed Services Committee. I yield to the gentleman from the State of Oklahoma, Mr. Steve Russell. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my brother, combat infantryman, warrior, and colleague from New York (Mr. Gibson) for his leadership in this effort. Madam Speaker, in 1940, our Nation faced tough decisions. Lawmakers in this Chamber debated over our constitutional requirement to defend our Republic. Faced with a decade of depression, declining budgets, and enormous domestic needs, President Roosevelt recognized that the Nation was woefully unprepared to defend herself, given the alarming developments in Asia and Europe the previous 2 years. Congress acted, and, although assured we could stay out of the war, this body passed the unprecedented Selective Service Act of 1940 to increase our defensive posture. While some would call it prescient or even timely, we were still woefully unprepared for the horrific attacks on our naval, land, and air forces in 1941. When the blow fell, we had for the first time a sizeable forward-deployed force based in the Philippine Islands in December 1941. That Allied force of 150,000 soldiers fought bravely for 5 months until their medical supplies, food, and, finally, ammunition were exhausted, prompting the largest surrender of U.S. forces in American history. Tens of thousands of these Allied soldiers died in brutal captivity, all simply because our Nation could not get to them. While we had future capacity, we had forfeited our defensive posture through cost- cutting policies the previous decade and we had exhausted our time. As unprepared as we were in 1940, it could have been even worse had the President and Congress not acted when they did. But here is something to ponder: our current land forces are actually 30 percent smaller today than they were in 1940 when you compare them to a percentage of our per capita population. If we lived today in an atmosphere of peace, maybe we could take such gambles. Instead, we see Russians reigniting the cold war, Iranians destabilizing the Middle East, North Koreans firing nuclear missiles with the aim to range the United States, and Islamic jihadist death- cult extremists committing acts of barbarity akin to the Middle Ages. We also see tensions rising with our trading partner, China, and the seeds of potential unrest in the Pacific. What does the President and this Congress intend to do if we do not act to prepare for this dangerous world? This year it would cut the United States Army by 30,000 more soldiers and our Marines by another 8,000. Instead, our bipartisan answer to these cuts in this Congress is a resounding no. Whatever savings we might imagine we safeguard, whatever tension we may imagine we could trim, whatever goodwill we deceive ourselves of that would go after, we assuredly would be eroded by an unexpected attack on our Nation as she has voluntarily chained herself down into a weakened condition. Rather than slacken our posture, we must slacken our chains. We stand together with much work ahead, but this bipartisan effort is a refusal to see our Nation further diminished. As we pass this measure into law, let's do it with the echo of these sobering words from novelist, historian, and Nobel Laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a survivor of torture and tyranny: I would like to call upon America to be more careful with its trust and prevent those who because of shortsightedness and still others out of self-interest from falsely using the struggle for peace and for social justice to lead you down a false road. Because they are trying to weaken you. They are trying to disarm your strong and magnificent country in the face of this fearful threat. I call upon you ordinary working men of America. Do not let yourselves become weak. Pass the POSTURE Act and prevent some horrific blow from berthing in our future. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibson for his outstanding leadership on this issue. Mr. GIBSON. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell). What we heard, Madam Speaker, just moments ago here is what I mentioned at the outset. We were talking about the changed assumptions when the administration first made these decisions. Of course, they were working based on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, the 2013 Strategic Choices and Management Review, and also the 2014 QDR. Madam Speaker, I think we just heard very persuasive argumentation how just in the last several years so much has changed and the reason why this Chamber is coming together in a bipartisan way to move forward on this POSTURE Act. Now, Madam Speaker, I want to turn to Representative Renee Ellmers. Renee is not on the Committee on Armed Services, but this lady works incredibly hard for our Nation and for our servicemen and -women. She studies all the time. I have had countless discussions with her. She is always wanting to know the details to make sure that the servicemen and -women who serve at Fort Bragg get all the resources that they need. She takes their combat readiness so very seriously because she knows that their lives are on the line there. [[Page H1785]] Fort Bragg could not ask for a stronger advocate. I am very impressed and am very thankful for her support in going above and beyond, not being on the committee and jurisdiction, to be here tonight and, really, to make her voice be heard all throughout this land on why we need to get behind the POSTURE Act. So I will just say last before I turn it over to her that part of what I know that Representative Ellmers is working on is a very important supporting element for our land forces, the 440th, which is based out of Fort Bragg and Pope Army Air Base. I know from firsthand experience this is an incredible outfit. We are concerned about some decisions that are being taken here. I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers) Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Gibson. I just want to start right off by saying, Madam Speaker, that our colleague, Mr. Gibson, has been a tireless voice for our military and certainly has been a resource for me and has always been more than open and honest with me when it comes to decisions that are facing our military and national security. Again, I just want to thank the gentleman for his service and, also, for coming to Washington to serve our country yet again, to be such an advocate for the military, and to be such a support for the rest of us who are trying to help in that capacity as well. I am here tonight to discuss in this Special Order the introduction of the POSTURE Act, and I thank the gentleman for this great piece of legislation. The POSTURE Act is an important piece of legislation that will prevent further troop reductions and improve military readiness. As the Representative of Fort Bragg based in North Carolina, I have the unique perspective to see how this troop drawdown is directly impacting our national security. It is my top priority to ensure that we restore our military's end strength not only to serve as a deterrent, but also so that our military can appropriately and effectively respond to any threat represented to our country or our allies. The POSTURE Act will ensure that our troops are ready and prepared to defend our Nation at a moment's notice. I would also like to thank Mr. Gibson for his help raising awareness about the serious issues facing Fort Bragg, including the deactivation of the 440th Airlift Wing. The 440th Airlift Wing provides unparalleled support to Fort Bragg paratroopers, more specifically, the famed 82nd Airborne's Global Response Force, a unit Mr. Gibson knows all too well, as he was the commander of this force just a few years back. Because of the potential deactivation of the 440th Airlift Wing, I have been having this very discussion about maintaining military readiness and maintaining sufficient troop levels for the last 2-plus years. This certainly is not the first time I have stepped foot onto the House floor to rail against the Air Force's ill-conceived decision to deactivate the 440th. In fact, I have stood in this very spot and stressed my concerns about the threats their decision poses to the readiness of the Fort Bragg paratroopers. Unfortunately, what I thought was going to happen is indeed taking place as we speak. While the Air Force has promised they would continue to provide necessary airlift support for Fort Bragg, the Air Force is already falling well short of this promise. {time} 1930 Fort Bragg aims to complete 10,000 jumps a month to prepare troops for combat, but the Air Force's decision to prematurely hollow out this wing has prevented them from meeting this jump goal. Last month, only 6,100 paratroopers jumped from Air Force planes. In fact, the Air Force has even fallen short on Fort Bragg's 8,000-jump minimum--a number they consider to be their threshold for proficiency. This is yet another consequence and, unfortunately, it is a concrete example of how drawdown can and will affect military readiness and training. Not only have I met with Fort Bragg leadership, but I have also met with our Nation's top military officials and still, to this day, I do not understand why the Air Force insists on making decisions based on zero strategic merit. To make matters worse, deactivation of the 440th is happening at a time when the 18th Airborne Corps was recently called upon to lead the fight against the Islamic extremist group ISIS. Members of the 18th Airborne Corps are set to deploy this summer. Meanwhile, we are on the track to have the smallest size Army since the end of World War II. Russia has become increasingly aggressive and China's military presence continues to grow in southeast Asia--all the while our President insists on drawing down our military and cutting its funding. This is not the time to be cutting our military. This is the time to strengthen it. Mr. Gibson's bill ensures that we will have appropriate end strength to keep our Nation and our allies safe and secure. I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Gibson and standing by him in this capacity, as I believe that strengthening our military is one of the most important issues facing Congress to date. Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I want to thank her for her strong voice, and I want to thank her for the attention to detail that she puts into this. This is so critically important. It is very instrumental in the momentum that we have had--your great voice, your staff's hard work, and your hard work. We are going to continue to push forward with this with the POSTURE Act, and continue to make sure that the entire installation at Fort Bragg has the necessary resources to deliver and to get its mission done and to look after and take care of its servicemen and -women, those paratroopers, and also the families. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). Representative Knight is also a veteran of our Armed Forces. He was born at Edwards Air Force Base in Antelope Valley, California. He served in the United States Army from 1985 to 1987. He was a track systems mechanic in Freiburg, Germany. When his tour ended, he served in the United States Army Reserve. His total military service spanned from 1985 to 1993. He is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Also, within his district, he has Air Force Plant 42 and the Edwards Air Force Base. Mr. KNIGHT. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibson for taking a leadership role in making sure that the military has a voice, and that is exactly what he has done in his tenure here in Congress. I rise in support of H.R. 4534. The POSTURE Act is not just something that we are asking for. It is basically the bare necessities. We are getting down to the limits. I can say, just on personal experience, when I enlisted in 1985 as a young person graduating high school and enlisting into the Army, I expected that we had such a great military and we had all of these things that were going to help me in my endeavors. As I went to Germany, my job was if something happened, if the Russians were going to come over, we were supposed to guard what was known as the Fulda Gap. I know that anyone who has ever served in the Army in the '80s knows what the Fulda Gap is. It was basically that line where we were going to stop the Russian Army. Unfortunately, they told us that we were going to be outrun about 11 to 1 at that time from the Russian Army. That is not something that an 18-year-old wants to know, is that the very first assignment that might happen in the cold war is you are going to go to a spot and you are going to be up against an 11-to-1 army. At that time, we had about 781,000 active Army folks. If we fast forward to today, we are sending people in rotations every 12 months or every 18 months. We are sending these people two, three, or four different rotations during their 4- or 6-year enlistments, and we have such a smaller active Army. I know that now folks out there will be talking about the total Army structure and the total structure. I think that is great that we have the Reserves and National Guard as part of the total structure. I believe in that. I think that is something that absolutely should happen. But if we are just doing apples to apples from 1986 to today, we go from about 780,000 to less than 500,000. That is getting down to a point where, can [[Page H1786]] we fight on two fronts, can we help, can we do all of the missions that the Army has done for the last 200 years? I would say that we are getting down to that point where if we don't pass the POSTURE Act, we will go underneath that level and we will not be able to send our warriors into combat and into humanitarian situations with our best effort, with our best foot forward. I would say that this is the absolute--the absolute--end to where we should draw down. Let's look at what we are looking at today. We are not looking at some of the larger countries, but we are also looking at rogue states. Russia and China, obviously, are out there and they are, obviously, doing things that we keep our eye on. Their technology has advanced, their amount of money that they spend on the military has jumped dramatically over the last 20 years. Some of the things that they are bringing forward are as technologically advanced as we have. I would say that if we went back 20 years, we would never say that. We would say technologically we are ahead every step of the way. Today we can't say that. Today we also have rogue nations and rogue leaders out there that want to do things to us and to our allies. So I say at a time where we are drawing down and continuing to draw down, where we have these types of rogue nations, where we have these types of superpowers out there, and we have these types of groups that want to do bad things to us and to our allies, is this actually the time that we should draw down to an unsafe level? I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for everything that he has done in his tenure here in Congress and what he has done for the United States of America because, honestly, he is a true hero. But in this regard, he is trying to unite all of Congress behind what he has believed and what he has done for his entire life. I think that Congress should listen, I think that Congress should say, yes, we absolutely have these levels, and we can't go below them. In fact, as we are watching everything that is happening on the news on a daily basis, we would say that maybe those levels are too low, too. So I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for his leadership. Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I thank him for his service to our Nation, and also thank him for his great work on the House Armed Services Committee. He is truly making a difference, and his voice here tonight is very compelling and very significant. Madam Speaker, I am now going to recap and move to close. I appreciate very much the time in a busy schedule and colleagues here tonight. We are here tonight, again, for H.R. 4534, the POSTURE Act, which stops the Obama administration's drawdown of our land forces--our Army and our Marine Corps. As I mentioned, this is a bipartisan bill--myself and 52 others here in this Chamber, including 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats, led so ably by Sergeant Major Retired Representative Tim Walz, a Democrat from Minnesota. I also want to say that Chairman Turner was not able to be here today, but he has been instrumental in not only help craft this, but actually help build support for it for these past several months. As I mentioned, Madam Speaker, tonight you heard five points why it is so important that we put the POSTURE Act into law and that we stop this drawdown. In the first point we gave some historical figures and some context of where we are today. We know that at present our land forces are about at the same size that we were on the 11th of September of 2001. Of course, during the surge, we saw a ramp-up of our land forces, and now we have seen a resetting of that where we are about at 11th of September of 2001 levels. However, the plan now from the administration is to continue that drawdown all the way down to pre-World War II levels. That would be done by 2018. That takes an additional 67,000 troops out of the formations. Madam Speaker, we heard, I think, some very significant testimony tonight from some of the speakers. We know that we have senior leaders in our Armed Forces now that have described this as a very serious risk, very significant risk. And you also heard from Representative Walz when he talked about the Commission on the Future of the Army, which Representative Walz, a humble man, was actually the author for that, the brain for that. We are here today because of his work on that score. The results of that commission, I believe, Madam Speaker, really need to be paid attention to. It was here that not only were we able to get a better understanding of this risk, but also we helped bring together all components of the Army--the regular Army, the National Guard, and the Army Reserve. The Commission on the Future of the Army helped. I also want to reinforce how important leadership is--our Chief of Staff of the Army, our Secretary of the Army, our Acting Secretary of the Army right now. They have put a major priority on really pulling together everyone that serves in the Army. The same goes for our Secretary of the Navy and for our Commandant of the Marine Corps because this is truly a team effort all the way across. That commission helped chart the way forward. Madam Speaker, the General Accounting Office, the GAO's report that came out just last week, documented what our research has also shown over these several months. That is that there is just too much risk in continuing this drawdown to pre-World War II levels. That was point one. In point two, we talked about the assumptions--we heard from all the speakers. Particularly, Mr. Russell focused in on that--how much of the world has changed. We can understand why the administration brought forward an argument back initially, but so much has changed since that time. It is clear to all of us that we need to pay attention to that and to adopt the POSTURE Act. We also pointed out this evening that this is not like a light switch. It is not something that we can turn on and turn off. If we decide to move forward with the 67,000 troops, taking them out of the formations, we know that we are looking at 3 to 4 years just to get back to where we are today, Madam Speaker. That would, I think, really signal to our potential adversaries the wrong message. The fourth point is--and we heard from a couple of the speakers--how important it is that we have the right size formations because that impacts on how often they get sent over into the combat zone and how long they stay. All of this has impacts on families, it has impacts on traumatic brain injury potential, and also posttraumatic stress. That is certainly something that this Chamber is absolutely unified in doing everything we can to support our servicemen and -women. By enacting the POSTURE Act, we are also supporting our currently serving members and our veterans. The last point--and this has been really made very clear to us by all the leadership in both the Army and the Marine Corps--is how important it is that by preserving this end strength, it has to come with the necessary resources so that they are manned, equipped, and trained, and that we look towards the modernization of the force and look towards the future. We have heard from the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO. The CBO initially assesses this at $600 million. We understand that there may be a new assessment coming forward shortly. But as was also mentioned by Sergeant Major Walz, Representative Walz, our committee is also very keenly going through the budget, a budget of over $600 billion, when you look at the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, the Overseas Contingency Fund. We are looking for ways to make sure we do this in the best way possible for the taxpayer. Madam Speaker, I include for the Record a series of letters of support that we are getting from the Association of the United States Army, the National Guard Association, and the Reserve Officers Association. We deeply appreciate their support. Association of the United States Army, Arlington, Virginia, 3 March 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Gibson: On behalf of the members of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA), I write to support your introduction of H.R. 4534, the ``Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End- [[Page H1787]] Strength Act of 2016'' or the ``POSTURE Act.'' At a time when our Army is confronting growing threats and increasing operational demands, it would be wise to pause the current budget-driven force reductions and allow the next administration time to assess land force capabilities and needs before determining troop levels, Under current plans, the Regular Army is expected to fall to 475,000 Soldiers by 1 October 2016, and then further decrease to 450,000 Soldiers by 1 October 2018. These same plans will also reduce the end strength of our Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. Such a reduction in our landpower capability does not make sense in a time of increased threats and global instability. While the POSTURE Act puts the brakes on budget-driven force reductions, the Army will also face negative consequences if the additional end strength is not funded. During a recent hearing on the Army's Fiscal Year 2017 budget, Army Chief of Staff GEN Mark Kinney told the Senate Appropriations Committee that stopping the drop in Army end strength without providing funding to cover the additional costs would undermine readiness and potentially result in a hollow Army. AUSA looks forward to working with you to advance the POSTURE Act, but urges you to consider ways to provide the additional resources to prepare our Army to face a dangerous and Increasingly unstable world. Sincerely, Gordon R. Sullivan, General, USA Retired. ____ National Guard Association of The United States, Inc. Washington, DC, February 26, 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. On behalf of the nearly 45,000 members of the National Guard Association of the United States and the approximately 450,000 soldiers and airmen of the National Guard, please accept our sincere thanks for your leadership in introducing the Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strength (POSTURE) Act of 2016 (H.R. 4534), a bill that would stop the drawdown of U.S. Land Forces. NGAUS strongly supports your legislation. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) recommended a minimally sufficient Total Army of 980,000 soldiers; however, it provided no optimal end-strength level. NGAUS testified before the NCFA that the Total Army was at the risk of becoming dangerously small given the current threat environment. Given the velocity of instability, the demand for U.S. Land Forces will likely only increase for the foreseeable future. U.S. Land Forces must be sized to address these threats without putting undue stress on our soldiers and marines. We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure this important legislation becomes law. Thank you, as always, for your continued support for members of the National Guard. Sincerely, Gus Hargett, Major General (Ret), USA, President. ____ Reserve Officers Association, 1 March 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Congressman Gibson: The Reserve Officers Association (ROA) supports your bill H.R. 4534, ``Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strength Act of 2016'' or the ``POSTURE Act.'' This bill recognizes the vital contributions of the Reserve Components and the need to ensure they have the right Fiscal Year 2016 end strength authorized. Since 9/11, more than 900,000 Reserve Component members have been activated to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and other contingencies. Despite increased use of the Guard and Reserve, the Congressional Research Service, identified end strength reductions between FY2001 and FY2015. ``Between FY2001 and FY2015, the largest shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the Navy Reserve (-31,600 or -35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-7,258 or -9.8%), and Coast Guard Reserve (-1,000 or -12.5%). A smaller change occurred in the Air National Guard (-3,022 or -2.8%) and Army Reserve (-3,300 or -1.6%), while the authorized end strength for the Army National Guard (-326 or -0.1%) and the Marine Corps Reserve (-358 or -0.9%) have been largely unchanged during this period, (FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues, R44120).'' As stated in the bill, passing this legislation will ensure Guard and Reserve members are available, ``. . . to deter threats, shape the international security 15 environment, respond to emergent situations and crises, and, if necessary, to fight and win the Nation's war, . . .'' ROA has a membership of 50,000, which represents all the uniformed services of the United States who would be favorably affected by your bill. Thank you for your efforts on this issue, and past support to the Military. Sincerely, Jeffrey E. Phillips, Executive Director. Mr. GIBSON. Lastly, Madam Speaker, the legislative strategy here is that we have been building out support. Our hope is that when the mark for the national security policy bill, which will be unveiled here in the next couple of weeks, that this bill will be included in the underlying bill because we think it is just so critically important that we get this done this year. Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to come together with my colleagues to talk about such an important issue for the American people. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1782-H1787] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] POTENTIAL DRAWDOWN OF LAND FORCES The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gibson) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include supporting material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, tonight I am speaking to gain support for H.R. 4534. This is the POSTURE Act. It stops the administration's drawdown of our land forces, the United States Marine Corps and the United States Army. This is a bipartisan bill, myself and 52 others, 52 cosponsors, including 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats. I am proud to say that we are coming together to make sure that we keep our land forces strong. This is also a bicameral bill. The language of this bill has also been introduced in the United States Senate. Madam Speaker, the predicate here is a belief in peace through strength, a belief that what we want to do is deter potential adversaries; and to do that, we certainly need to restore our capability in our Armed Forces, deterrence really being capability and will. Tonight I am focused in on the POSTURE Act. Of course, Madam Speaker, the coauthors and I, we certainly share deep concern for the entire joint force, but today we are particularly focused in on the land forces. [[Page H1783]] You will hear, across the evening here, five general points. They are: Number one, that the drawdown plan currently from the administration is planned to continue into 2018, for several more years here; and at the culmination of that, our land forces will actually be at pre-World War II levels. Given the very volatile, uncertain, ambiguous international environment that we live in, we believe, the authors, that this is very high risk; and, really, we want to change that and, essentially, preserve 67,000 troops in end strength in the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps. That is number one. The second point is the assumptions that were made, Madam Speaker, when the administration initially made the decision on the drawdown, we believe that those assumptions are no longer valid. There has been much change in the world in the last several years, and you will hear some of that this evening. The third point, which is very important, is that, with our land forces, this is not like a light switch where we can turn it on, turn it off, turn it back on. If we end up standing down these 67,000 troops, it could take 3 to 4 years to reconstitute that force level; and given the uncertainty we have in this international environment, we think that that is too much risk for us to take on. Madam Speaker, the fourth point, and here I will speak from my personal experience of 29 years in the military, is that this planned drawdown also has consequence for our servicemen and -women. It has, certainly, consequence in terms of the op tempo, the operational tempo, of how many deployments they will go on and for how long, the duration of those deployments. And also, we know the risk. The enemy's weapon of choice in this war is the improvised explosive device, and we know that that has led to significant challenge with traumatic brain injuries and also post- traumatic stress. Certainly, there is wide bipartisan support in this Chamber to care for our servicemen and -women and their families, and that is why these bipartisan authors are also very concerned about end strength. That is point 4. The fifth point is this: when we preserve this--because I believe we are gaining momentum and, ultimately, I like our chances; we are going to get this into law--it is very important that this end strength come with the necessary resources so that we do not hollow out this force. So, Madam Speaker, we are going to have a series of speakers now, my coauthors on the bill. I want to begin with my original coauthor, and he is the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in this Chamber. He is a great American hero, Tim Walz. He is a Democrat from Minnesota. In 1989, he earned the title of Nebraska Citizen Soldier of the Year. After deployment to Italy with his Guard unit, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Sergeant Major Walz retired from the Army National Guard and resumed teaching as a geography teacher and a football coach at Mankato West Senior High School. He is a member of the Armed Services Committee, and he is also a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), my good colleague and friend. Mr. WALZ. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York. It is a phrase we sometimes throw around in here without a lot of authenticity behind it, but I can tell you, in this case, a gentleman who served this Nation three decades in uniform and has had a distinguished career here in Congress, I am proud to stand with you. I think you heard the gentleman's comments on why we think now is not the right time to draw down this land force, and I say that with both of us coming out of that force. The size of the force this Nation needs should not be predicated by a plan that is outdated. Since the time this plan was written and put into effect: the rise of ISIS, China has built a new island in the South China Sea and is landing aircraft on it now, and a belligerent Russia. But more than that, we have seen the use of the military force as a deterrent, not just to aggression. We have seen it as a peaceful use, whether it be in Haiti to respond to natural disasters or to respond to Ebola in West Africa. The best trained, the most efficient and the most ready force to be able to use our diplomacy and our humanitarian assets is this land force. I think for many of us, we were concerned about this, but this is not ideologically driven. The gentleman and I coauthored a piece of legislation that created the National Commission on the Future of the Army. We said: Let's let the data speak for itself. If the experts can take this in and assess that this force is enough to do what needs to be done according to the strategic plan of this Nation by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the best thinkers, then that is the way it should be. But they did not come back with that. They came about some alarming things that they talked about, and one of them, I think it is very clear we are heading down the wrong path, stripping it of manpower. There is a belief in this Nation that we can solve all problems, especially security problems, with the use of technology. Our technological advantage is a huge positive force, but it will not be on the ground with Ebola. It will not be there when we have to have that defending force. {time} 1915 As everyone in this Chamber knows, 15 years of war puts an incredible stress on that. The gentleman used a great analogy. He talked about turning on and off the lights. I use the one that I think a lot of people think: This is like running the car out of gas. If we just need more, we will put more gas in it. That is not true. It is running the car out of oil, which causes all kinds of problems. If we do not keep the force where it is at, keep it trained, and keep it ready to go, we will not be able to carry out those missions. I would like to highlight a couple of other things that the Commission said about the integration of the National Guard to the active components and the use of the National Guard as an operational reserve, not a strategic reserve. Those of us who lived through the years where the National Guard was an afterthought and we practiced artillery training with toilet paper rolls instead of real charges because we didn't have the capacity to train, that is the surest way to make sure our force is not ready to go. It is not a good use of taxpayer dollars, and it is simply immoral to train America's young warriors without the full capacity of what they need. So I think, for many of us, this is not only a national security issue, it is a smart fiscal issue. We have paid dearly with treasure and blood to have this force. I can tell you, if the force shrinks too much--and we have seen this happen--the rotations happen very quickly. All the speakers you are going to hear tonight, Madam Speaker, are going to tell you about this. It becomes very difficult both from the personal side for them to manage their relationships, but also the professional side of soldiering. You can't get to the schools you need. You can't develop the wider breadth that you need for all contingencies. We have become very, very good at small missions that the same people get rotated into without the ability to look elsewhere. So as we pivot to the Pacific, those are new skill sets that need to be incorporated in. What the gentleman is asking for is let's just pause in the drawdown, let's keep the force where the Commission and the GAO says it needs to be, let's give the force the ability to rotate out and to do what needs to be done to have them get back and ready to get in the fight again in a way that makes sense. We can do that. Again, I want to be very clear. Those critics who say that we are asking to build up the military, we are just asking to stop a drawdown that we think gets dangerously close to putting this Nation in a predicament where it cannot carry out the missions that are asked of it. We in this Chamber and the American public have a moral responsibility to never put a warrior in that position and never put those commanders in that position. So I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this forward. I want to thank him for being willing to champion this forward. We know this is about educating not only our colleagues, but the [[Page H1784]] American public. It is about having a debate. I think the gentleman from New York brought up a critical point. Numbers without the ability to train, equip, and do what is necessary to get them to the highest level of readiness is probably worse than nothing, and that is not what we are asking for. I think, again, to highlight the gentleman's commitment to this, he is looking at ways to pay for it. He is looking at ways to make it work: repealing sequestration, pursuing waste, eliminating programs at the Pentagon, encouraging and assisting our allies and partners to beef up what they need to do to beef up, and ensure the next President has the force capable to not only address current, but future threats. That is our responsibility. So I am proud to stand with the gentleman on the POSTURE Act. I think it is smart policy. It is predicated on data. It is predicated on decades of personal experience from the gentleman from New York and speakers you are going to hear coming up. It is what the thinkers are telling us. Again, I think it does come back to the gentleman's opening comments. Those adversaries who think that this is the time to do something with this Nation need to be sent a strong message that we are as strong as ever, our commitment is as strong as ever, and our force will be as it always has been: the best trained and the best fighting force the world has ever seen. We are just asking to give them the numbers to do their job. So, Madam Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to take a look at this, to get on board, and to talk with the gentleman, myself, and the other cosponsors of this. Let's put that next President in a position to be able to secure this Nation, to be able to forward project American power in the name of humanitarian or human rights, and continue to give our young warriors what they need. Mr. GIBSON. I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker, you just heard, I think, in really compelling terms and you saw witness to why it is that we have the finest fighting force in the world. What separates us from the rest of the world is our noncommissioned officer corps. This is an incredible collection of professionals that provide advice, analysis, and recommendations. Really, I would put our noncommissioned officer corps up against any other noncommissioned officer corps in the world. I want to say, beyond that, he is a phenomenal Representative here in the U.S. House. I want to thank the gentleman for that tremendous testimony and for his great leadership. I now want to turn to another great warrior, Representative Steve Russell. Steve Russell is, Madam Speaker, an Airborne Ranger. He has served in airborne, light, and mechanized infantry assignments. His deployments include deployment to Kosovo, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Madam Speaker, in 2003, then-Lieutenant Colonel Steve Russell commanded the task force in Iraq that was instrumental in the hunt and capture of Saddam Hussein. He is in his first term. He is already off to an amazing start. He is a member of the Armed Services Committee. I yield to the gentleman from the State of Oklahoma, Mr. Steve Russell. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my brother, combat infantryman, warrior, and colleague from New York (Mr. Gibson) for his leadership in this effort. Madam Speaker, in 1940, our Nation faced tough decisions. Lawmakers in this Chamber debated over our constitutional requirement to defend our Republic. Faced with a decade of depression, declining budgets, and enormous domestic needs, President Roosevelt recognized that the Nation was woefully unprepared to defend herself, given the alarming developments in Asia and Europe the previous 2 years. Congress acted, and, although assured we could stay out of the war, this body passed the unprecedented Selective Service Act of 1940 to increase our defensive posture. While some would call it prescient or even timely, we were still woefully unprepared for the horrific attacks on our naval, land, and air forces in 1941. When the blow fell, we had for the first time a sizeable forward-deployed force based in the Philippine Islands in December 1941. That Allied force of 150,000 soldiers fought bravely for 5 months until their medical supplies, food, and, finally, ammunition were exhausted, prompting the largest surrender of U.S. forces in American history. Tens of thousands of these Allied soldiers died in brutal captivity, all simply because our Nation could not get to them. While we had future capacity, we had forfeited our defensive posture through cost- cutting policies the previous decade and we had exhausted our time. As unprepared as we were in 1940, it could have been even worse had the President and Congress not acted when they did. But here is something to ponder: our current land forces are actually 30 percent smaller today than they were in 1940 when you compare them to a percentage of our per capita population. If we lived today in an atmosphere of peace, maybe we could take such gambles. Instead, we see Russians reigniting the cold war, Iranians destabilizing the Middle East, North Koreans firing nuclear missiles with the aim to range the United States, and Islamic jihadist death- cult extremists committing acts of barbarity akin to the Middle Ages. We also see tensions rising with our trading partner, China, and the seeds of potential unrest in the Pacific. What does the President and this Congress intend to do if we do not act to prepare for this dangerous world? This year it would cut the United States Army by 30,000 more soldiers and our Marines by another 8,000. Instead, our bipartisan answer to these cuts in this Congress is a resounding no. Whatever savings we might imagine we safeguard, whatever tension we may imagine we could trim, whatever goodwill we deceive ourselves of that would go after, we assuredly would be eroded by an unexpected attack on our Nation as she has voluntarily chained herself down into a weakened condition. Rather than slacken our posture, we must slacken our chains. We stand together with much work ahead, but this bipartisan effort is a refusal to see our Nation further diminished. As we pass this measure into law, let's do it with the echo of these sobering words from novelist, historian, and Nobel Laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a survivor of torture and tyranny: I would like to call upon America to be more careful with its trust and prevent those who because of shortsightedness and still others out of self-interest from falsely using the struggle for peace and for social justice to lead you down a false road. Because they are trying to weaken you. They are trying to disarm your strong and magnificent country in the face of this fearful threat. I call upon you ordinary working men of America. Do not let yourselves become weak. Pass the POSTURE Act and prevent some horrific blow from berthing in our future. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibson for his outstanding leadership on this issue. Mr. GIBSON. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell). What we heard, Madam Speaker, just moments ago here is what I mentioned at the outset. We were talking about the changed assumptions when the administration first made these decisions. Of course, they were working based on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, the 2013 Strategic Choices and Management Review, and also the 2014 QDR. Madam Speaker, I think we just heard very persuasive argumentation how just in the last several years so much has changed and the reason why this Chamber is coming together in a bipartisan way to move forward on this POSTURE Act. Now, Madam Speaker, I want to turn to Representative Renee Ellmers. Renee is not on the Committee on Armed Services, but this lady works incredibly hard for our Nation and for our servicemen and -women. She studies all the time. I have had countless discussions with her. She is always wanting to know the details to make sure that the servicemen and -women who serve at Fort Bragg get all the resources that they need. She takes their combat readiness so very seriously because she knows that their lives are on the line there. [[Page H1785]] Fort Bragg could not ask for a stronger advocate. I am very impressed and am very thankful for her support in going above and beyond, not being on the committee and jurisdiction, to be here tonight and, really, to make her voice be heard all throughout this land on why we need to get behind the POSTURE Act. So I will just say last before I turn it over to her that part of what I know that Representative Ellmers is working on is a very important supporting element for our land forces, the 440th, which is based out of Fort Bragg and Pope Army Air Base. I know from firsthand experience this is an incredible outfit. We are concerned about some decisions that are being taken here. I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers) Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Gibson. I just want to start right off by saying, Madam Speaker, that our colleague, Mr. Gibson, has been a tireless voice for our military and certainly has been a resource for me and has always been more than open and honest with me when it comes to decisions that are facing our military and national security. Again, I just want to thank the gentleman for his service and, also, for coming to Washington to serve our country yet again, to be such an advocate for the military, and to be such a support for the rest of us who are trying to help in that capacity as well. I am here tonight to discuss in this Special Order the introduction of the POSTURE Act, and I thank the gentleman for this great piece of legislation. The POSTURE Act is an important piece of legislation that will prevent further troop reductions and improve military readiness. As the Representative of Fort Bragg based in North Carolina, I have the unique perspective to see how this troop drawdown is directly impacting our national security. It is my top priority to ensure that we restore our military's end strength not only to serve as a deterrent, but also so that our military can appropriately and effectively respond to any threat represented to our country or our allies. The POSTURE Act will ensure that our troops are ready and prepared to defend our Nation at a moment's notice. I would also like to thank Mr. Gibson for his help raising awareness about the serious issues facing Fort Bragg, including the deactivation of the 440th Airlift Wing. The 440th Airlift Wing provides unparalleled support to Fort Bragg paratroopers, more specifically, the famed 82nd Airborne's Global Response Force, a unit Mr. Gibson knows all too well, as he was the commander of this force just a few years back. Because of the potential deactivation of the 440th Airlift Wing, I have been having this very discussion about maintaining military readiness and maintaining sufficient troop levels for the last 2-plus years. This certainly is not the first time I have stepped foot onto the House floor to rail against the Air Force's ill-conceived decision to deactivate the 440th. In fact, I have stood in this very spot and stressed my concerns about the threats their decision poses to the readiness of the Fort Bragg paratroopers. Unfortunately, what I thought was going to happen is indeed taking place as we speak. While the Air Force has promised they would continue to provide necessary airlift support for Fort Bragg, the Air Force is already falling well short of this promise. {time} 1930 Fort Bragg aims to complete 10,000 jumps a month to prepare troops for combat, but the Air Force's decision to prematurely hollow out this wing has prevented them from meeting this jump goal. Last month, only 6,100 paratroopers jumped from Air Force planes. In fact, the Air Force has even fallen short on Fort Bragg's 8,000-jump minimum--a number they consider to be their threshold for proficiency. This is yet another consequence and, unfortunately, it is a concrete example of how drawdown can and will affect military readiness and training. Not only have I met with Fort Bragg leadership, but I have also met with our Nation's top military officials and still, to this day, I do not understand why the Air Force insists on making decisions based on zero strategic merit. To make matters worse, deactivation of the 440th is happening at a time when the 18th Airborne Corps was recently called upon to lead the fight against the Islamic extremist group ISIS. Members of the 18th Airborne Corps are set to deploy this summer. Meanwhile, we are on the track to have the smallest size Army since the end of World War II. Russia has become increasingly aggressive and China's military presence continues to grow in southeast Asia--all the while our President insists on drawing down our military and cutting its funding. This is not the time to be cutting our military. This is the time to strengthen it. Mr. Gibson's bill ensures that we will have appropriate end strength to keep our Nation and our allies safe and secure. I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Gibson and standing by him in this capacity, as I believe that strengthening our military is one of the most important issues facing Congress to date. Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I want to thank her for her strong voice, and I want to thank her for the attention to detail that she puts into this. This is so critically important. It is very instrumental in the momentum that we have had--your great voice, your staff's hard work, and your hard work. We are going to continue to push forward with this with the POSTURE Act, and continue to make sure that the entire installation at Fort Bragg has the necessary resources to deliver and to get its mission done and to look after and take care of its servicemen and -women, those paratroopers, and also the families. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). Representative Knight is also a veteran of our Armed Forces. He was born at Edwards Air Force Base in Antelope Valley, California. He served in the United States Army from 1985 to 1987. He was a track systems mechanic in Freiburg, Germany. When his tour ended, he served in the United States Army Reserve. His total military service spanned from 1985 to 1993. He is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. Also, within his district, he has Air Force Plant 42 and the Edwards Air Force Base. Mr. KNIGHT. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gibson for taking a leadership role in making sure that the military has a voice, and that is exactly what he has done in his tenure here in Congress. I rise in support of H.R. 4534. The POSTURE Act is not just something that we are asking for. It is basically the bare necessities. We are getting down to the limits. I can say, just on personal experience, when I enlisted in 1985 as a young person graduating high school and enlisting into the Army, I expected that we had such a great military and we had all of these things that were going to help me in my endeavors. As I went to Germany, my job was if something happened, if the Russians were going to come over, we were supposed to guard what was known as the Fulda Gap. I know that anyone who has ever served in the Army in the '80s knows what the Fulda Gap is. It was basically that line where we were going to stop the Russian Army. Unfortunately, they told us that we were going to be outrun about 11 to 1 at that time from the Russian Army. That is not something that an 18-year-old wants to know, is that the very first assignment that might happen in the cold war is you are going to go to a spot and you are going to be up against an 11-to-1 army. At that time, we had about 781,000 active Army folks. If we fast forward to today, we are sending people in rotations every 12 months or every 18 months. We are sending these people two, three, or four different rotations during their 4- or 6-year enlistments, and we have such a smaller active Army. I know that now folks out there will be talking about the total Army structure and the total structure. I think that is great that we have the Reserves and National Guard as part of the total structure. I believe in that. I think that is something that absolutely should happen. But if we are just doing apples to apples from 1986 to today, we go from about 780,000 to less than 500,000. That is getting down to a point where, can [[Page H1786]] we fight on two fronts, can we help, can we do all of the missions that the Army has done for the last 200 years? I would say that we are getting down to that point where if we don't pass the POSTURE Act, we will go underneath that level and we will not be able to send our warriors into combat and into humanitarian situations with our best effort, with our best foot forward. I would say that this is the absolute--the absolute--end to where we should draw down. Let's look at what we are looking at today. We are not looking at some of the larger countries, but we are also looking at rogue states. Russia and China, obviously, are out there and they are, obviously, doing things that we keep our eye on. Their technology has advanced, their amount of money that they spend on the military has jumped dramatically over the last 20 years. Some of the things that they are bringing forward are as technologically advanced as we have. I would say that if we went back 20 years, we would never say that. We would say technologically we are ahead every step of the way. Today we can't say that. Today we also have rogue nations and rogue leaders out there that want to do things to us and to our allies. So I say at a time where we are drawing down and continuing to draw down, where we have these types of rogue nations, where we have these types of superpowers out there, and we have these types of groups that want to do bad things to us and to our allies, is this actually the time that we should draw down to an unsafe level? I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for everything that he has done in his tenure here in Congress and what he has done for the United States of America because, honestly, he is a true hero. But in this regard, he is trying to unite all of Congress behind what he has believed and what he has done for his entire life. I think that Congress should listen, I think that Congress should say, yes, we absolutely have these levels, and we can't go below them. In fact, as we are watching everything that is happening on the news on a daily basis, we would say that maybe those levels are too low, too. So I would like to thank Mr. Gibson for his leadership. Mr. GIBSON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I thank him for his service to our Nation, and also thank him for his great work on the House Armed Services Committee. He is truly making a difference, and his voice here tonight is very compelling and very significant. Madam Speaker, I am now going to recap and move to close. I appreciate very much the time in a busy schedule and colleagues here tonight. We are here tonight, again, for H.R. 4534, the POSTURE Act, which stops the Obama administration's drawdown of our land forces--our Army and our Marine Corps. As I mentioned, this is a bipartisan bill--myself and 52 others here in this Chamber, including 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats, led so ably by Sergeant Major Retired Representative Tim Walz, a Democrat from Minnesota. I also want to say that Chairman Turner was not able to be here today, but he has been instrumental in not only help craft this, but actually help build support for it for these past several months. As I mentioned, Madam Speaker, tonight you heard five points why it is so important that we put the POSTURE Act into law and that we stop this drawdown. In the first point we gave some historical figures and some context of where we are today. We know that at present our land forces are about at the same size that we were on the 11th of September of 2001. Of course, during the surge, we saw a ramp-up of our land forces, and now we have seen a resetting of that where we are about at 11th of September of 2001 levels. However, the plan now from the administration is to continue that drawdown all the way down to pre-World War II levels. That would be done by 2018. That takes an additional 67,000 troops out of the formations. Madam Speaker, we heard, I think, some very significant testimony tonight from some of the speakers. We know that we have senior leaders in our Armed Forces now that have described this as a very serious risk, very significant risk. And you also heard from Representative Walz when he talked about the Commission on the Future of the Army, which Representative Walz, a humble man, was actually the author for that, the brain for that. We are here today because of his work on that score. The results of that commission, I believe, Madam Speaker, really need to be paid attention to. It was here that not only were we able to get a better understanding of this risk, but also we helped bring together all components of the Army--the regular Army, the National Guard, and the Army Reserve. The Commission on the Future of the Army helped. I also want to reinforce how important leadership is--our Chief of Staff of the Army, our Secretary of the Army, our Acting Secretary of the Army right now. They have put a major priority on really pulling together everyone that serves in the Army. The same goes for our Secretary of the Navy and for our Commandant of the Marine Corps because this is truly a team effort all the way across. That commission helped chart the way forward. Madam Speaker, the General Accounting Office, the GAO's report that came out just last week, documented what our research has also shown over these several months. That is that there is just too much risk in continuing this drawdown to pre-World War II levels. That was point one. In point two, we talked about the assumptions--we heard from all the speakers. Particularly, Mr. Russell focused in on that--how much of the world has changed. We can understand why the administration brought forward an argument back initially, but so much has changed since that time. It is clear to all of us that we need to pay attention to that and to adopt the POSTURE Act. We also pointed out this evening that this is not like a light switch. It is not something that we can turn on and turn off. If we decide to move forward with the 67,000 troops, taking them out of the formations, we know that we are looking at 3 to 4 years just to get back to where we are today, Madam Speaker. That would, I think, really signal to our potential adversaries the wrong message. The fourth point is--and we heard from a couple of the speakers--how important it is that we have the right size formations because that impacts on how often they get sent over into the combat zone and how long they stay. All of this has impacts on families, it has impacts on traumatic brain injury potential, and also posttraumatic stress. That is certainly something that this Chamber is absolutely unified in doing everything we can to support our servicemen and -women. By enacting the POSTURE Act, we are also supporting our currently serving members and our veterans. The last point--and this has been really made very clear to us by all the leadership in both the Army and the Marine Corps--is how important it is that by preserving this end strength, it has to come with the necessary resources so that they are manned, equipped, and trained, and that we look towards the modernization of the force and look towards the future. We have heard from the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO. The CBO initially assesses this at $600 million. We understand that there may be a new assessment coming forward shortly. But as was also mentioned by Sergeant Major Walz, Representative Walz, our committee is also very keenly going through the budget, a budget of over $600 billion, when you look at the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, the Overseas Contingency Fund. We are looking for ways to make sure we do this in the best way possible for the taxpayer. Madam Speaker, I include for the Record a series of letters of support that we are getting from the Association of the United States Army, the National Guard Association, and the Reserve Officers Association. We deeply appreciate their support. Association of the United States Army, Arlington, Virginia, 3 March 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Gibson: On behalf of the members of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA), I write to support your introduction of H.R. 4534, the ``Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End- [[Page H1787]] Strength Act of 2016'' or the ``POSTURE Act.'' At a time when our Army is confronting growing threats and increasing operational demands, it would be wise to pause the current budget-driven force reductions and allow the next administration time to assess land force capabilities and needs before determining troop levels, Under current plans, the Regular Army is expected to fall to 475,000 Soldiers by 1 October 2016, and then further decrease to 450,000 Soldiers by 1 October 2018. These same plans will also reduce the end strength of our Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. Such a reduction in our landpower capability does not make sense in a time of increased threats and global instability. While the POSTURE Act puts the brakes on budget-driven force reductions, the Army will also face negative consequences if the additional end strength is not funded. During a recent hearing on the Army's Fiscal Year 2017 budget, Army Chief of Staff GEN Mark Kinney told the Senate Appropriations Committee that stopping the drop in Army end strength without providing funding to cover the additional costs would undermine readiness and potentially result in a hollow Army. AUSA looks forward to working with you to advance the POSTURE Act, but urges you to consider ways to provide the additional resources to prepare our Army to face a dangerous and Increasingly unstable world. Sincerely, Gordon R. Sullivan, General, USA Retired. ____ National Guard Association of The United States, Inc. Washington, DC, February 26, 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. On behalf of the nearly 45,000 members of the National Guard Association of the United States and the approximately 450,000 soldiers and airmen of the National Guard, please accept our sincere thanks for your leadership in introducing the Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strength (POSTURE) Act of 2016 (H.R. 4534), a bill that would stop the drawdown of U.S. Land Forces. NGAUS strongly supports your legislation. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) recommended a minimally sufficient Total Army of 980,000 soldiers; however, it provided no optimal end-strength level. NGAUS testified before the NCFA that the Total Army was at the risk of becoming dangerously small given the current threat environment. Given the velocity of instability, the demand for U.S. Land Forces will likely only increase for the foreseeable future. U.S. Land Forces must be sized to address these threats without putting undue stress on our soldiers and marines. We look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure this important legislation becomes law. Thank you, as always, for your continued support for members of the National Guard. Sincerely, Gus Hargett, Major General (Ret), USA, President. ____ Reserve Officers Association, 1 March 2016. Hon. Chris Gibson, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Congressman Gibson: The Reserve Officers Association (ROA) supports your bill H.R. 4534, ``Protecting Our Security Through Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strength Act of 2016'' or the ``POSTURE Act.'' This bill recognizes the vital contributions of the Reserve Components and the need to ensure they have the right Fiscal Year 2016 end strength authorized. Since 9/11, more than 900,000 Reserve Component members have been activated to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and other contingencies. Despite increased use of the Guard and Reserve, the Congressional Research Service, identified end strength reductions between FY2001 and FY2015. ``Between FY2001 and FY2015, the largest shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the Navy Reserve (-31,600 or -35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-7,258 or -9.8%), and Coast Guard Reserve (-1,000 or -12.5%). A smaller change occurred in the Air National Guard (-3,022 or -2.8%) and Army Reserve (-3,300 or -1.6%), while the authorized end strength for the Army National Guard (-326 or -0.1%) and the Marine Corps Reserve (-358 or -0.9%) have been largely unchanged during this period, (FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues, R44120).'' As stated in the bill, passing this legislation will ensure Guard and Reserve members are available, ``. . . to deter threats, shape the international security 15 environment, respond to emergent situations and crises, and, if necessary, to fight and win the Nation's war, . . .'' ROA has a membership of 50,000, which represents all the uniformed services of the United States who would be favorably affected by your bill. Thank you for your efforts on this issue, and past support to the Military. Sincerely, Jeffrey E. Phillips, Executive Director. Mr. GIBSON. Lastly, Madam Speaker, the legislative strategy here is that we have been building out support. Our hope is that when the mark for the national security policy bill, which will be unveiled here in the next couple of weeks, that this bill will be included in the underlying bill because we think it is just so critically important that we get this done this year. Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to come together with my colleagues to talk about such an important issue for the American people. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,40222,40222,40289,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [house] [pages h1782-h1787] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] potential drawdown of land forces the speaker pro tempore (mrs. comstock). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from new york (mr. gibson) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. general leave mr. gibson. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include supporting material on the subject of this special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? there was no objection. mr. gibson. madam speaker, tonight i am speaking to gain support for h.r. 4534. this is the posture act. it stops the administration's drawdown of our land forces, the united states marine corps and the united states army. this is a bipartisan bill, myself and 52 others, 52 cosponsors, including 42 republicans and 10 democrats. i am proud to say that we are coming together to make sure that we keep our land forces strong. this is also a bicameral bill. the language of this bill has also been introduced in the united states senate. madam speaker, the predicate here is a belief in peace through strength, a belief that what we want to do is deter potential adversaries; and to do that, we certainly need to restore our capability in our armed forces, deterrence really being capability and will. tonight i am focused in on the posture act. of course, madam speaker, the coauthors and i, we certainly share deep concern for the entire joint force, but today we are particularly focused in on the land forces. [[page h1783]] you will hear, across the evening here, five general points. they are: number one, that the drawdown plan currently from the administration is planned to continue into 2018, for several more years here; and at the culmination of that, our land forces will actually be at pre-world war ii levels. given the very volatile, uncertain, ambiguous international environment that we live in, we believe, the authors, that this is very high risk; and, really, we want to change that and, essentially, preserve 67,000 troops in end strength in the united states army and the united states marine corps. that is number one. the second point is the assumptions that were made, madam speaker, when the administration initially made the decision on the drawdown, we believe that those assumptions are no longer valid. there has been much change in the world in the last several years, and you will hear some of that this evening. the third point, which is very important, is that, with our land forces, this is not like a light switch where we can turn it on, turn it off, turn it back on. if we end up standing down these 67,000 troops, it could take 3 to 4 years to reconstitute that force level; and given the uncertainty we have in this international environment, we think that that is too much risk for us to take on. madam speaker, the fourth point, and here i will speak from my personal experience of 29 years in the military, is that this planned drawdown also has consequence for our servicemen and -women. it has, certainly, consequence in terms of the op tempo, the operational tempo, of how many deployments they will go on and for how long, the duration of those deployments. and also, we know the risk. the enemy's weapon of choice in this war is the improvised explosive device, and we know that that has led to significant challenge with traumatic brain injuries and also post- traumatic stress. certainly, there is wide bipartisan support in this chamber to care for our servicemen and -women and their families, and that is why these bipartisan authors are also very concerned about end strength. that is point 4. the fifth point is this: when we preserve this--because i believe we are gaining momentum and, ultimately, i like our chances; we are going to get this into law--it is very important that this end strength come with the necessary resources so that we do not hollow out this force. so, madam speaker, we are going to have a series of speakers now, my coauthors on the bill. i want to begin with my original coauthor, and he is the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in this chamber. he is a great american hero, tim walz. he is a democrat from minnesota. in 1989, he earned the title of nebraska citizen soldier of the year. after deployment to italy with his guard unit, as part of operation enduring freedom, sergeant major walz retired from the army national guard and resumed teaching as a geography teacher and a football coach at mankato west senior high school. he is a member of the armed services committee, and he is also a member of the veterans' affairs committee. madam speaker, i yield to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. walz), my good colleague and friend. mr. walz. madam speaker, i thank my good friend from new york. it is a phrase we sometimes throw around in here without a lot of authenticity behind it, but i can tell you, in this case, a gentleman who served this nation three decades in uniform and has had a distinguished career here in congress, i am proud to stand with you. i think you heard the gentleman's comments on why we think now is not the right time to draw down this land force, and i say that with both of us coming out of that force. the size of the force this nation needs should not be predicated by a plan that is outdated. since the time this plan was written and put into effect: the rise of isis, china has built a new island in the south china sea and is landing aircraft on it now, and a belligerent russia. but more than that, we have seen the use of the military force as a deterrent, not just to aggression. we have seen it as a peaceful use, whether it be in haiti to respond to natural disasters or to respond to ebola in west africa. the best trained, the most efficient and the most ready force to be able to use our diplomacy and our humanitarian assets is this land force. i think for many of us, we were concerned about this, but this is not ideologically driven. the gentleman and i coauthored a piece of legislation that created the national commission on the future of the army. we said: let's let the data speak for itself. if the experts can take this in and assess that this force is enough to do what needs to be done according to the strategic plan of this nation by the joint chiefs of staff and the best thinkers, then that is the way it should be. but they did not come back with that. they came about some alarming things that they talked about, and one of them, i think it is very clear we are heading down the wrong path, stripping it of manpower. there is a belief in this nation that we can solve all problems, especially security problems, with the use of technology. our technological advantage is a huge positive force, but it will not be on the ground with ebola. it will not be there when we have to have that defending force. {time} 1915 as everyone in this chamber knows, 15 years of war puts an incredible stress on that. the gentleman used a great analogy. he talked about turning on and off the lights. i use the one that i think a lot of people think: this is like running the car out of gas. if we just need more, we will put more gas in it. that is not true. it is running the car out of oil, which causes all kinds of problems. if we do not keep the force where it is at, keep it trained, and keep it ready to go, we will not be able to carry out those missions. i would like to highlight a couple of other things that the commission said about the integration of the national guard to the active components and the use of the national guard as an operational reserve, not a strategic reserve. those of us who lived through the years where the national guard was an afterthought and we practiced artillery training with toilet paper rolls instead of real charges because we didn't have the capacity to train, that is the surest way to make sure our force is not ready to go. it is not a good use of taxpayer dollars, and it is simply immoral to train america's young warriors without the full capacity of what they need. so i think, for many of us, this is not only a national security issue, it is a smart fiscal issue. we have paid dearly with treasure and blood to have this force. i can tell you, if the force shrinks too much--and we have seen this happen--the rotations happen very quickly. all the speakers you are going to hear tonight, madam speaker, are going to tell you about this. it becomes very difficult both from the personal side for them to manage their relationships, but also the professional side of soldiering. you can't get to the schools you need. you can't develop the wider breadth that you need for all contingencies. we have become very, very good at small missions that the same people get rotated into without the ability to look elsewhere. so as we pivot to the pacific, those are new skill sets that need to be incorporated in. what the gentleman is asking for is let's just pause in the drawdown, let's keep the force where the commission and the gao says it needs to be, let's give the force the ability to rotate out and to do what needs to be done to have them get back and ready to get in the fight again in a way that makes sense. we can do that. again, i want to be very clear. those critics who say that we are asking to build up the military, we are just asking to stop a drawdown that we think gets dangerously close to putting this nation in a predicament where it cannot carry out the missions that are asked of it. we in this chamber and the american public have a moral responsibility to never put a warrior in that position and never put those commanders in that position. so i want to thank the gentleman for bringing this forward. i want to thank him for being willing to champion this forward. we know this is about educating not only our colleagues, but the [[page h1784]] american public. it is about having a debate. i think the gentleman from new york brought up a critical point. numbers without the ability to train, equip, and do what is necessary to get them to the highest level of readiness is probably worse than nothing, and that is not what we are asking for. i think, again, to highlight the gentleman's commitment to this, he is looking at ways to pay for it. he is looking at ways to make it work: repealing sequestration, pursuing waste, eliminating programs at the pentagon, encouraging and assisting our allies and partners to beef up what they need to do to beef up, and ensure the next president has the force capable to not only address current, but future threats. that is our responsibility. so i am proud to stand with the gentleman on the posture act. i think it is smart policy. it is predicated on data. it is predicated on decades of personal experience from the gentleman from new york and speakers you are going to hear coming up. it is what the thinkers are telling us. again, i think it does come back to the gentleman's opening comments. those adversaries who think that this is the time to do something with this nation need to be sent a strong message that we are as strong as ever, our commitment is as strong as ever, and our force will be as it always has been: the best trained and the best fighting force the world has ever seen. we are just asking to give them the numbers to do their job. so, madam speaker, i would encourage my colleagues to take a look at this, to get on board, and to talk with the gentleman, myself, and the other cosponsors of this. let's put that next president in a position to be able to secure this nation, to be able to forward project american power in the name of humanitarian or human rights, and continue to give our young warriors what they need. mr. gibson. i thank the gentleman. madam speaker, you just heard, i think, in really compelling terms and you saw witness to why it is that we have the finest fighting force in the world. what separates us from the rest of the world is our noncommissioned officer corps. this is an incredible collection of professionals that provide advice, analysis, and recommendations. really, i would put our noncommissioned officer corps up against any other noncommissioned officer corps in the world. i want to say, beyond that, he is a phenomenal representative here in the u.s. house. i want to thank the gentleman for that tremendous testimony and for his great leadership. i now want to turn to another great warrior, representative steve russell. steve russell is, madam speaker, an airborne ranger. he has served in airborne, light, and mechanized infantry assignments. his deployments include deployment to kosovo, kuwait, afghanistan, and iraq. madam speaker, in 2003, then-lieutenant colonel steve russell commanded the task force in iraq that was instrumental in the hunt and capture of saddam hussein. he is in his first term. he is already off to an amazing start. he is a member of the armed services committee. i yield to the gentleman from the state of oklahoma, mr. steve russell. mr. russell. madam speaker, i want to thank my brother, combat infantryman, warrior, and colleague from new york (mr. gibson) for his leadership in this effort. madam speaker, in 1940, our nation faced tough decisions. lawmakers in this chamber debated over our constitutional requirement to defend our republic. faced with a decade of depression, declining budgets, and enormous domestic needs, president roosevelt recognized that the nation was woefully unprepared to defend herself, given the alarming developments in asia and europe the previous 2 years. congress acted, and, although assured we could stay out of the war, this body passed the unprecedented selective service act of 1940 to increase our defensive posture. while some would call it prescient or even timely, we were still woefully unprepared for the horrific attacks on our naval, land, and air forces in 1941. when the blow fell, we had for the first time a sizeable forward-deployed force based in the philippine islands in december 1941. that allied force of 150,000 soldiers fought bravely for 5 months until their medical supplies, food, and, finally, ammunition were exhausted, prompting the largest surrender of u.s. forces in american history. tens of thousands of these allied soldiers died in brutal captivity, all simply because our nation could not get to them. while we had future capacity, we had forfeited our defensive posture through cost- cutting policies the previous decade and we had exhausted our time. as unprepared as we were in 1940, it could have been even worse had the president and congress not acted when they did. but here is something to ponder: our current land forces are actually 30 percent smaller today than they were in 1940 when you compare them to a percentage of our per capita population. if we lived today in an atmosphere of peace, maybe we could take such gambles. instead, we see russians reigniting the cold war, iranians destabilizing the middle east, north koreans firing nuclear missiles with the aim to range the united states, and islamic jihadist death- cult extremists committing acts of barbarity akin to the middle ages. we also see tensions rising with our trading partner, china, and the seeds of potential unrest in the pacific. what does the president and this congress intend to do if we do not act to prepare for this dangerous world? this year it would cut the united states army by 30,000 more soldiers and our marines by another 8,000. instead, our bipartisan answer to these cuts in this congress is a resounding no. whatever savings we might imagine we safeguard, whatever tension we may imagine we could trim, whatever goodwill we deceive ourselves of that would go after, we assuredly would be eroded by an unexpected attack on our nation as she has voluntarily chained herself down into a weakened condition. rather than slacken our posture, we must slacken our chains. we stand together with much work ahead, but this bipartisan effort is a refusal to see our nation further diminished. as we pass this measure into law, let's do it with the echo of these sobering words from novelist, historian, and nobel laureate aleksandr solzhenitsyn, a survivor of torture and tyranny: i would like to call upon america to be more careful with its trust and prevent those who because of shortsightedness and still others out of self-interest from falsely using the struggle for peace and for social justice to lead you down a false road. because they are trying to weaken you. they are trying to disarm your strong and magnificent country in the face of this fearful threat. i call upon you ordinary working men of america. do not let yourselves become weak. pass the posture act and prevent some horrific blow from berthing in our future. madam speaker, i thank mr. gibson for his outstanding leadership on this issue. mr. gibson. i thank the gentleman from oklahoma (mr. russell). what we heard, madam speaker, just moments ago here is what i mentioned at the outset. we were talking about the changed assumptions when the administration first made these decisions. of course, they were working based on the 2012 defense strategic guidance, the 2013 strategic choices and management review, and also the 2014 qdr. madam speaker, i think we just heard very persuasive argumentation how just in the last several years so much has changed and the reason why this chamber is coming together in a bipartisan way to move forward on this posture act. now, madam speaker, i want to turn to representative renee ellmers. renee is not on the committee on armed services, but this lady works incredibly hard for our nation and for our servicemen and -women. she studies all the time. i have had countless discussions with her. she is always wanting to know the details to make sure that the servicemen and -women who serve at fort bragg get all the resources that they need. she takes their combat readiness so very seriously because she knows that their lives are on the line there. [[page h1785]] fort bragg could not ask for a stronger advocate. i am very impressed and am very thankful for her support in going above and beyond, not being on the committee and jurisdiction, to be here tonight and, really, to make her voice be heard all throughout this land on why we need to get behind the posture act. so i will just say last before i turn it over to her that part of what i know that representative ellmers is working on is a very important supporting element for our land forces, the 440th, which is based out of fort bragg and pope army air base. i know from firsthand experience this is an incredible outfit. we are concerned about some decisions that are being taken here. i yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina (mrs. ellmers) mrs. ellmers of north carolina. madam speaker, i thank my colleague, mr. gibson. i just want to start right off by saying, madam speaker, that our colleague, mr. gibson, has been a tireless voice for our military and certainly has been a resource for me and has always been more than open and honest with me when it comes to decisions that are facing our military and national security. again, i just want to thank the gentleman for his service and, also, for coming to washington to serve our country yet again, to be such an advocate for the military, and to be such a support for the rest of us who are trying to help in that capacity as well. i am here tonight to discuss in this special order the introduction of the posture act, and i thank the gentleman for this great piece of legislation. the posture act is an important piece of legislation that will prevent further troop reductions and improve military readiness. as the representative of fort bragg based in north carolina, i have the unique perspective to see how this troop drawdown is directly impacting our national security. it is my top priority to ensure that we restore our military's end strength not only to serve as a deterrent, but also so that our military can appropriately and effectively respond to any threat represented to our country or our allies. the posture act will ensure that our troops are ready and prepared to defend our nation at a moment's notice. i would also like to thank mr. gibson for his help raising awareness about the serious issues facing fort bragg, including the deactivation of the 440th airlift wing. the 440th airlift wing provides unparalleled support to fort bragg paratroopers, more specifically, the famed 82nd airborne's global response force, a unit mr. gibson knows all too well, as he was the commander of this force just a few years back. because of the potential deactivation of the 440th airlift wing, i have been having this very discussion about maintaining military readiness and maintaining sufficient troop levels for the last 2-plus years. this certainly is not the first time i have stepped foot onto the house floor to rail against the air force's ill-conceived decision to deactivate the 440th. in fact, i have stood in this very spot and stressed my concerns about the threats their decision poses to the readiness of the fort bragg paratroopers. unfortunately, what i thought was going to happen is indeed taking place as we speak. while the air force has promised they would continue to provide necessary airlift support for fort bragg, the air force is already falling well short of this promise. {time} 1930 fort bragg aims to complete 10,000 jumps a month to prepare troops for combat, but the air force's decision to prematurely hollow out this wing has prevented them from meeting this jump goal. last month, only 6,100 paratroopers jumped from air force planes. in fact, the air force has even fallen short on fort bragg's 8,000-jump minimum--a number they consider to be their threshold for proficiency. this is yet another consequence and, unfortunately, it is a concrete example of how drawdown can and will affect military readiness and training. not only have i met with fort bragg leadership, but i have also met with our nation's top military officials and still, to this day, i do not understand why the air force insists on making decisions based on zero strategic merit. to make matters worse, deactivation of the 440th is happening at a time when the 18th airborne corps was recently called upon to lead the fight against the islamic extremist group isis. members of the 18th airborne corps are set to deploy this summer. meanwhile, we are on the track to have the smallest size army since the end of world war ii. russia has become increasingly aggressive and china's military presence continues to grow in southeast asia--all the while our president insists on drawing down our military and cutting its funding. this is not the time to be cutting our military. this is the time to strengthen it. mr. gibson's bill ensures that we will have appropriate end strength to keep our nation and our allies safe and secure. i look forward to continuing to work with mr. gibson and standing by him in this capacity, as i believe that strengthening our military is one of the most important issues facing congress to date. mr. gibson. madam speaker, i thank the gentlewoman. i want to thank her for her strong voice, and i want to thank her for the attention to detail that she puts into this. this is so critically important. it is very instrumental in the momentum that we have had--your great voice, your staff's hard work, and your hard work. we are going to continue to push forward with this with the posture act, and continue to make sure that the entire installation at fort bragg has the necessary resources to deliver and to get its mission done and to look after and take care of its servicemen and -women, those paratroopers, and also the families. madam speaker, i yield to the gentleman from california (mr. knight). representative knight is also a veteran of our armed forces. he was born at edwards air force base in antelope valley, california. he served in the united states army from 1985 to 1987. he was a track systems mechanic in freiburg, germany. when his tour ended, he served in the united states army reserve. his total military service spanned from 1985 to 1993. he is a member of the house armed services committee. also, within his district, he has air force plant 42 and the edwards air force base. mr. knight. madam speaker, i thank mr. gibson for taking a leadership role in making sure that the military has a voice, and that is exactly what he has done in his tenure here in congress. i rise in support of h.r. 4534. the posture act is not just something that we are asking for. it is basically the bare necessities. we are getting down to the limits. i can say, just on personal experience, when i enlisted in 1985 as a young person graduating high school and enlisting into the army, i expected that we had such a great military and we had all of these things that were going to help me in my endeavors. as i went to germany, my job was if something happened, if the russians were going to come over, we were supposed to guard what was known as the fulda gap. i know that anyone who has ever served in the army in the '80s knows what the fulda gap is. it was basically that line where we were going to stop the russian army. unfortunately, they told us that we were going to be outrun about 11 to 1 at that time from the russian army. that is not something that an 18-year-old wants to know, is that the very first assignment that might happen in the cold war is you are going to go to a spot and you are going to be up against an 11-to-1 army. at that time, we had about 781,000 active army folks. if we fast forward to today, we are sending people in rotations every 12 months or every 18 months. we are sending these people two, three, or four different rotations during their 4- or 6-year enlistments, and we have such a smaller active army. i know that now folks out there will be talking about the total army structure and the total structure. i think that is great that we have the reserves and national guard as part of the total structure. i believe in that. i think that is something that absolutely should happen. but if we are just doing apples to apples from 1986 to today, we go from about 780,000 to less than 500,000. that is getting down to a point where, can [[page h1786]] we fight on two fronts, can we help, can we do all of the missions that the army has done for the last 200 years? i would say that we are getting down to that point where if we don't pass the posture act, we will go underneath that level and we will not be able to send our warriors into combat and into humanitarian situations with our best effort, with our best foot forward. i would say that this is the absolute--the absolute--end to where we should draw down. let's look at what we are looking at today. we are not looking at some of the larger countries, but we are also looking at rogue states. russia and china, obviously, are out there and they are, obviously, doing things that we keep our eye on. their technology has advanced, their amount of money that they spend on the military has jumped dramatically over the last 20 years. some of the things that they are bringing forward are as technologically advanced as we have. i would say that if we went back 20 years, we would never say that. we would say technologically we are ahead every step of the way. today we can't say that. today we also have rogue nations and rogue leaders out there that want to do things to us and to our allies. so i say at a time where we are drawing down and continuing to draw down, where we have these types of rogue nations, where we have these types of superpowers out there, and we have these types of groups that want to do bad things to us and to our allies, is this actually the time that we should draw down to an unsafe level? i would like to thank mr. gibson for everything that he has done in his tenure here in congress and what he has done for the united states of america because, honestly, he is a true hero. but in this regard, he is trying to unite all of congress behind what he has believed and what he has done for his entire life. i think that congress should listen, i think that congress should say, yes, we absolutely have these levels, and we can't go below them. in fact, as we are watching everything that is happening on the news on a daily basis, we would say that maybe those levels are too low, too. so i would like to thank mr. gibson for his leadership. mr. gibson. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman. i thank him for his service to our nation, and also thank him for his great work on the house armed services committee. he is truly making a difference, and his voice here tonight is very compelling and very significant. madam speaker, i am now going to recap and move to close. i appreciate very much the time in a busy schedule and colleagues here tonight. we are here tonight, again, for h.r. 4534, the posture act, which stops the obama administration's drawdown of our land forces--our army and our marine corps. as i mentioned, this is a bipartisan bill--myself and 52 others here in this chamber, including 42 republicans and 10 democrats, led so ably by sergeant major retired representative tim walz, a democrat from minnesota. i also want to say that chairman turner was not able to be here today, but he has been instrumental in not only help craft this, but actually help build support for it for these past several months. as i mentioned, madam speaker, tonight you heard five points why it is so important that we put the posture act into law and that we stop this drawdown. in the first point we gave some historical figures and some context of where we are today. we know that at present our land forces are about at the same size that we were on the 11th of september of 2001. of course, during the surge, we saw a ramp-up of our land forces, and now we have seen a resetting of that where we are about at 11th of september of 2001 levels. however, the plan now from the administration is to continue that drawdown all the way down to pre-world war ii levels. that would be done by 2018. that takes an additional 67,000 troops out of the formations. madam speaker, we heard, i think, some very significant testimony tonight from some of the speakers. we know that we have senior leaders in our armed forces now that have described this as a very serious risk, very significant risk. and you also heard from representative walz when he talked about the commission on the future of the army, which representative walz, a humble man, was actually the author for that, the brain for that. we are here today because of his work on that score. the results of that commission, i believe, madam speaker, really need to be paid attention to. it was here that not only were we able to get a better understanding of this risk, but also we helped bring together all components of the army--the regular army, the national guard, and the army reserve. the commission on the future of the army helped. i also want to reinforce how important leadership is--our chief of staff of the army, our secretary of the army, our acting secretary of the army right now. they have put a major priority on really pulling together everyone that serves in the army. the same goes for our secretary of the navy and for our commandant of the marine corps because this is truly a team effort all the way across. that commission helped chart the way forward. madam speaker, the general accounting office, the gao's report that came out just last week, documented what our research has also shown over these several months. that is that there is just too much risk in continuing this drawdown to pre-world war ii levels. that was point one. in point two, we talked about the assumptions--we heard from all the speakers. particularly, mr. russell focused in on that--how much of the world has changed. we can understand why the administration brought forward an argument back initially, but so much has changed since that time. it is clear to all of us that we need to pay attention to that and to adopt the posture act. we also pointed out this evening that this is not like a light switch. it is not something that we can turn on and turn off. if we decide to move forward with the 67,000 troops, taking them out of the formations, we know that we are looking at 3 to 4 years just to get back to where we are today, madam speaker. that would, i think, really signal to our potential adversaries the wrong message. the fourth point is--and we heard from a couple of the speakers--how important it is that we have the right size formations because that impacts on how often they get sent over into the combat zone and how long they stay. all of this has impacts on families, it has impacts on traumatic brain injury potential, and also posttraumatic stress. that is certainly something that this chamber is absolutely unified in doing everything we can to support our servicemen and -women. by enacting the posture act, we are also supporting our currently serving members and our veterans. the last point--and this has been really made very clear to us by all the leadership in both the army and the marine corps--is how important it is that by preserving this end strength, it has to come with the necessary resources so that they are manned, equipped, and trained, and that we look towards the modernization of the force and look towards the future. we have heard from the congressional budget office, the cbo. the cbo initially assesses this at $600 million. we understand that there may be a new assessment coming forward shortly. but as was also mentioned by sergeant major walz, representative walz, our committee is also very keenly going through the budget, a budget of over $600 billion, when you look at the department of defense and department of energy, the overseas contingency fund. we are looking for ways to make sure we do this in the best way possible for the taxpayer. madam speaker, i include for the record a series of letters of support that we are getting from the association of the united states army, the national guard association, and the reserve officers association. we deeply appreciate their support. association of the united states army, arlington, virginia, 3 march 2016. hon. chris gibson, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear mr. gibson: on behalf of the members of the association of the united states army (ausa), i write to support your introduction of h.r. 4534, the ``protecting our security through utilizing right-sized end- [[page h1787]] strength act of 2016'' or the ``posture act.'' at a time when our army is confronting growing threats and increasing operational demands, it would be wise to pause the current budget-driven force reductions and allow the next administration time to assess land force capabilities and needs before determining troop levels, under current plans, the regular army is expected to fall to 475,000 soldiers by 1 october 2016, and then further decrease to 450,000 soldiers by 1 october 2018. these same plans will also reduce the end strength of our army national guard and the army reserve. such a reduction in our landpower capability does not make sense in a time of increased threats and global instability. while the posture act puts the brakes on budget-driven force reductions, the army will also face negative consequences if the additional end strength is not funded. during a recent hearing on the army's fiscal year 2017 budget, army chief of staff gen mark kinney told the senate appropriations committee that stopping the drop in army end strength without providing funding to cover the additional costs would undermine readiness and potentially result in a hollow army. ausa looks forward to working with you to advance the posture act, but urges you to consider ways to provide the additional resources to prepare our army to face a dangerous and increasingly unstable world. sincerely, gordon r. sullivan, general, usa retired. ____ national guard association of the united states, inc. washington, dc, february 26, 2016. hon. chris gibson, house of representatives, washington, dc. on behalf of the nearly 45,000 members of the national guard association of the united states and the approximately 450,000 soldiers and airmen of the national guard, please accept our sincere thanks for your leadership in introducing the protecting our security through utilizing right-sized end-strength (posture) act of 2016 (h.r. 4534), a bill that would stop the drawdown of u.s. land forces. ngaus strongly supports your legislation. the national commission on the future of the army (ncfa) recommended a minimally sufficient total army of 980,000 soldiers; however, it provided no optimal end-strength level. ngaus testified before the ncfa that the total army was at the risk of becoming dangerously small given the current threat environment. given the velocity of instability, the demand for u.s. land forces will likely only increase for the foreseeable future. u.s. land forces must be sized to address these threats without putting undue stress on our soldiers and marines. we look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure this important legislation becomes law. thank you, as always, for your continued support for members of the national guard. sincerely, gus hargett, major general (ret), usa, president. ____ reserve officers association, 1 march 2016. hon. chris gibson, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear congressman gibson: the reserve officers association (roa) supports your bill h.r. 4534, ``protecting our security through utilizing right-sized end-strength act of 2016'' or the ``posture act.'' this bill recognizes the vital contributions of the reserve components and the need to ensure they have the right fiscal year 2016 end strength authorized. since 9/11, more than 900,000 reserve component members have been activated to support operation iraqi freedom, operation new dawn, and other contingencies. despite increased use of the guard and reserve, the congressional research service, identified end strength reductions between fy2001 and fy2015. ``between fy2001 and fy2015, the largest shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the navy reserve (-31,600 or -35.5%), air force reserve (-7,258 or -9.8%), and coast guard reserve (-1,000 or -12.5%). a smaller change occurred in the air national guard (-3,022 or -2.8%) and army reserve (-3,300 or -1.6%), while the authorized end strength for the army national guard (-326 or -0.1%) and the marine corps reserve (-358 or -0.9%) have been largely unchanged during this period, (fy2016 national defense authorization act: selected military personnel issues, r44120).'' as stated in the bill, passing this legislation will ensure guard and reserve members are available, ``. . . to deter threats, shape the international security 15 environment, respond to emergent situations and crises, and, if necessary, to fight and win the nation's war, . . .'' roa has a membership of 50,000, which represents all the uniformed services of the united states who would be favorably affected by your bill. thank you for your efforts on this issue, and past support to the military. sincerely, jeffrey e. phillips, executive director. mr. gibson. lastly, madam speaker, the legislative strategy here is that we have been building out support. our hope is that when the mark for the national security policy bill, which will be unveiled here in the next couple of weeks, that this bill will be included in the underlying bill because we think it is just so critically important that we get this done this year. madam speaker, i thank you for this opportunity to come together with my colleagues to talk about such an important issue for the american people. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",40222
CREC-2016-04-18-pt1-PgH1787,CREC-2016-04-18,114,CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS--ROAD TO RUIN: HOUSE REPUBLICANS FAIL ON THE BUDGET,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1787-H1793] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS--ROAD TO RUIN: HOUSE REPUBLICANS FAIL ON THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege, once again, to come to the House floor on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and join with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, as we anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order--the CBC hour of power--where, for 60 minutes, we get an opportunity to talk to the American people about issues of great importance to the African American community, to our democracy, and, certainly, to our country at large. Today, we are here to discuss, tragically, the House GOP's continued failure to demonstrate the ability to govern in a basic fashion--that is to pass a budget, which is required by statutory law, as of April 15. That deadline has come and gone, and we are still waiting for the House majority to present a budget to this body for our consideration. We were told for years by people, including by the current Speaker of this great House, that the most fundamental tenet of governing is the passage of a budget. Yet, even with Republicans in firm control of both the House and the Senate, it seems that this Congress is still unable to get its act together. It is a stunning act of legislative abdication of basic responsibilities. We are going to explore that tonight, not just from a procedural standpoint, but from a standpoint of how this is indicative of this majority's unwillingness and inability to do the business of the American people. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to my distinguished colleague, my coanchor, my classmate--the always eloquent and effervescent gentlewoman from the great city of Columbus in the great State of Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank the gentleman. I always look forward to engaging in our Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour and, tonight, for our dialogue, for our debate, on the House Republicans' repeated failure to pass a budget. First, let me say, as your classmate and colleague, being able to be the voice for your constituents and my constituents and America at large, it is an honor. I think it is so important, when we think about how important the work of this Congress is, for us to take on challenging the House Republicans' road to ruin. Madam Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus is going to discuss the importance of why we should pass a budget. Not only that, I am sure Mr. Jeffries and I will have a dialogue about the value and the importance of having a budget. As Members of Congress and, especially, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, we know specifically that a budget creates jobs and that it raises the paychecks of hardworking American people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. Madam Speaker, let me just take a moment to point out that this is not [[Page H1788]] the first time that the Congressional Black Caucus has held a Special Order hour on the subject of the Republicans' inaction. Earlier this year, the Congressional Black Caucus came to this House floor and implored the Republican leadership to do its job--the job America wants us to do--and that was to enact commonsense gun control legislation. To date, Madam Speaker, Republicans have continued to fail the American people by putting forth or by bringing forth commonsense gun control legislation. It is still hanging out there, waiting for action. Now, again, here in the House of Representatives, the people's House, we are faced with another instance of Republican failure. Under law, as spelled out in title III of the Congressional Budget Act, Congress is directed to complete actions on the concurrent resolution on the budget by April 15, as we heard Mr. Jeffries remind us. A concurrent resolution on the budget means it is supposed to pass both the Senate and the House, again, by April 15. At this date, neither Chamber has considered a budget resolution for 2017. Madam Speaker, I don't know about your constituents, but in my district, Ohio's Third Congressional District, my constituents expect Congress to work; so let's take a look at it. What happens when people refuse to do their jobs? If postal workers don't deliver, you don't get your mail. If farmers don't farm, people don't eat. If teachers don't show up, our children don't learn. People all over America take their jobs seriously, and they expect us, as their elected officials, to also do that. It is time for House Republicans to get America off the road to ruin and back on the path to prosperity. When Speaker Ryan took office--this is worth repeating, and Congressman Jeffries mentioned this earlier. When Speaker Ryan took office, House Republicans stated that passing a budget was a basic function of government. However, the statutory deadline of passing a budget resolution by April 15 has come and gone, although House Republicans made passing a budget a top priority for this year. In the Republicans' own words, they can't even accomplish the basic functions of government--their job. Madam Speaker, why do we care that we don't have a budget? Let me give you the answer. The importance of setting a budget is that it lays out the blueprint for the appropriations process. It outlines government spending for the year. Without a budget, we have 12 appropriations bills that are working their way through Congress without there being guiding principles on overall spending. If we cannot as a Congress perform the basic functions of governing, how are we going to tackle the much more complicated issues, such as income inequality, education quality, tuition affordability, tax reform, and so many others? Once again, House Republicans have demonstrated the degree to which the sharp division within their Conference is impeding Congress' ability to work for the American people. Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hardworking American families, they have just decided not to pass a budget. This decision was made despite the fact that President Obama submitted his budget request to Congress back in February. As you may remember, Madam Speaker, the Republican majority here in the House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate took the unprecedented step of refusing to receive the OMB Director for a formal hearing so as to present the President's budget. Madam Speaker, how did that turn out for us? We all know how it turned out. The Republican Conference failed the American people, and it set us on a road to ruin by not passing a budget. Mr. Jeffries, I look forward to our continuing this dialogue tonight with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank Congresswoman Beatty for a very thorough presentation and for pointing out that the Speaker, himself, and the Republican majority have indicated that they should be judged based on their capacity to complete the basics of their job responsibilities, which include the passage of a budget resolution. In fact, it was then- Congressman Ryan who, in 2012, stated that failing to enact a budget has serious consequences for American families. There are at least three current health crises that we are trying to deal with in America and throughout the world, but Republicans have abdicated their responsibility: the Zika virus, the Flint water crisis, and the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner cities, in suburban America, and all throughout the rural parts of this country; yet House Republicans have failed not just to put forth a budget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues, but they have chosen to simply ignore these crises in a manner that represents such a stunning departure of what responsible Members of Congress should be doing at this particular point in time. I am thankful that we have been joined by the distinguished gentlewoman from the great Lone Star State, who has always been thoughtful and eloquent on issues of importance not just to her district, which is anchored in Houston, Texas, but through her membership and leadership on the Homeland Security Committee as well as on the House Judiciary Committee. She has been so thoughtful and effective on a great many issues in the context of our safety, of our well-being, of criminal justice reform, of course, and of the protection of civil liberties--all issues that are fundamental to our democracy in the same way that a budgetary roadmap is fundamental to our democracy. Let me yield to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank my colleagues for their eloquence but, more importantly, for the Congressional Black Caucus in its taking up the mantle of the moral compass of justice. One would argue that justice is tied to our committee, the Judiciary Committee; but as I look at this Congress and as I look at a very small document called the Constitution, one can anchor the responsibilities of this body--of both the House and the Senate--Mr. Jeffries, in the Bill of Rights. I would like to just, very briefly, take us on a journey that indicates that our moral compass is broken because a budget that was supposed to be passed on April 15, by midnight, was not. To the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, let me thank her. She will have her own distinctive story, in her eloquence, about the fairness to the territories. I listened, as I came in, to the presentation by the gentlewoman from Ohio, who knows full well that we need a budget to ensure that there is full employment in America. Then I work extensively with my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, and we will not pass or fund prison reform without a budget. I rise today, however, to weave in and out of my comments about the moral compass that is broken to indicate that my district--the 18th Congressional District in Houston, Texas, and Harris County--is under a terrible emergency disaster. We are underwater. We are again facing an enormous rainfall that has been listed as historic and, possibly, as catastrophic. Let me acknowledge my mayor, Mayor Turner, and county judge, Judge Emmett, for the work that has been done so far; and let me indicate two pastors with whom I have just gotten off the phone, Bishop Dixon and Bishop Bady, who are watching hungry people come to a site, looking for food. {time} 2000 As I was speaking to the emergency leadership, they are indicating they were evacuating babies from apartments and people were being displaced. So what does that have to do with where we are today and no budget? Well, we know that the President introduced his budget a few months ago. Because of his responsibility, we know that Homeland Security was provided funding and FEMA was provided funding to deal with emergency declarations of a disaster. My district now needs it more than they have ever needed it. They need it in terms of providing for those immediate needs of vulnerable people without the resources to have stocked food, medical care, clothing, and also those who may be off work now because of the disaster. So we don't have a budget. We are not moving along to ensure that [[Page H1789]] FEMA, which has seen a lot of disasters over the last 2 years, has the necessary funding to do their job. That is a broken moral compass. It also reflects the Constitution because we are owed an equal treatment under the law and due process under the Fifth Amendment. There is no due process when I hear that one area is under water and we are not able to get help. Let me also say that, as I watch a broken moral system, I also look at the predicament that we will be in with the Zika virus. Congressman Jeffries has mentioned the opioid crisis, and we cannot forget the water crisis in Flint, but there is also the water crisis across the Nation. There is hard work that is being done by the Members in Michigan and Mr. Kildee. They need a budget to be able to fund the crisis or to help repair the crisis, restorative dollars, that a budget does to give a roadmap to the appropriators. I also know that we are facing another potential epidemic, if you will, the Zika virus that is taking control of places like Puerto Rico and other places in the Caribbean, places that we have not yet fully documented. I can assure you that the Gulf Coast States of Florida, Louisiana, and Texas are in the eye of the storm. The President a couple of months ago dutifully and responsibly introduced to this Congress a request of $1.9 billion--no, I didn't say trillions. I didn't say 5 billion. I said 1.9 billion--so that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can do their job. Mr. Jeffries, colleagues, if we are not doing our job, we need those who have the distinctive responsibility for issues of health and epidemics in this country to be able to do their job. We have now been told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it is not just in the prestages of pregnancy that the Zika virus can have a severe impact. It is throughout the pregnancy. We also know that they have just determined that it will be severe brain damage that will come about. So how irresponsible can it be to not put forward the emergency supplemental of $1.9 billion? I have sent letters to Secretary Burwell. I have sent letters to, obviously, the President of the United States in supporting his efforts. I have sent letters to our leader, Nancy Pelosi, who has been a champion on these issues of Zika funding. And I have sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan. Might I speak to the Speaker and certainly ask that a half-baked, if I might say, contribution to fighting the Zika virus is not going to work because any taking of monies from other places is going to damage the funding of malaria, tuberculosis, and a universal flu vaccine. Yes, it is going to undermine our needed and continued effort of fighting Ebola. Let me finish by simply saying this: Along with the idea of the Zika virus and other crises, when we hear headlines like this that indicate Americans still don't see a vibrant labor market, then you know what else is needed under this budget? We need a budget to be able to fully fund the retraining of Americans. I have introduced legislation that will train middle-age or middle- management workers and others and give them a stipend while they are being retrained for the 21st century jobs. We cannot do that with a budget not passed and an assessment not being made on how we would fund job training. Lastly, the Supreme Court heard a case today dealing with the issues of executive orders and immigration. I would argue that Texas and the other States do not have standing because they are not required to give driver's licenses or anything else, as the President provides a prioritization of who should be deported. I will say to you that, over the years, we have said over and over again to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which could have been a key element of a budget revenue to be able to help this country move along. Without a budget and an intelligent discussion about what comprehensive immigration reform would do as an added revenue for this country, here we are mumbling along while Houston remains under water, needing resources from FEMA, while the Zika virus is in distress with no monies and while a number of other important issues are not addressed. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jeffries for allowing me to spend a moment to at least tie in the Bill of Rights that deal with the very core values of this country. We have let down that basic document that guarantees equal protection, guarantees a certain freedom to be protected, guarantees that Americans have due process, if you will, and certainly guarantees the freedom of expression so that Americans can speak and be heard. They are speaking, but they are not being heard. What a shame that this budget has not been passed. I am grateful to the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me acknowledge the chairman and say: Let us keep our fight going because we have reason to provide that kind of comfort to the American people. Madam Speaker, Last week, House Republicans blew past the statutory deadline for Congress to enact a budget--reflecting apparently the belief of the Leadership that their already severe budget proposal was not radical enough to pass through a Republican Majority. The Do-Nothing Republican Congress is back. Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hard-working American families, Republicans have decided not to pass a budget at all. The Republican-led Budget Committee, at the direction of the House GOP Leadership, put forward the most devastating `Road to Ruin' budget in history, but the Republican majority has rejected the plan as insufficiently severe. Here's what was too weak to satisfy the radical forces that have seized control of the Republican Party; a budget that would: 1. End the Medicare guarantee for seniors; 2. Make $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the House Budget Committee; 3. Devastate investments in good-paying jobs, education, and American infrastructure; 4. Repeal the Affordable Care Act and dismantle the affordable health care of 20 million Americans. Republicans have failed to keep their promise to pass a budget but their goal is still clear: to take us back to the radical trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle- class Americans. At the same time, House Republicans have done nothing to help the thousands of Americans struggling to protect their families from the three public health emergencies of the Zika virus, opioid addiction and the Flint Water Crisis: 1. As the House Democratic Leadership wrote to Speaker Ryan last month, these public health crises require swift and decisive Congressional action. 2. Also last week, Democrats on the Appropriations Committee wrote to Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY), requesting an immediate hearing on the Administration's $1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for Zika, pointing out that ``The Zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the potential to affect millions of Americans this summer, including more than two million pregnant women.'' 3. But House Republicans have responded with nothing but inaction and indifference. Instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public health crises, House Republicans are now wasting a full week grandstanding on the IRS. That's just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the American people have come to expect from the Do-Nothing Republican Congress. As NPR notes: Under Republican leadership, the 114th Congress has been ``short on meaty legislation and short on weeks in session . . . But there seems to be plenty of time to think about other things. Last month, one House member introduced a measure that would nationally recognized magic as an art form.'' Hard-working families deserve a Congress that invests in their future, protects safety, and creates a level-playing field for them and their children to succeed. Democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs and raises the paychecks of the American people, while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. Today, the Supreme -Court heard oral arguments in its review of the President's Immigration Executive Actions, which, as a result of congressional Republicans' inaction, address our Nation's broken immigration system and set important priorities in enforcing our immigration laws. The President's executive actions fall well within both the clear legal authority provided by Congress and the Constitution, and the [[Page H1790]] well-established precedents of immigration actions by every Democrat and Republican President for the last 50 years. 1. Six Republican presidents have used the same clear authority to make our immigration enforcement priorities better fit our values as a people and our needs as a nation; 2. Past presidents have routinely acted in the face of Congressional inaction; 3. Numerous noted legal scholars have found that the President's actions are well within his legal authority. The Immigration Executive Actions follow the same constitutional and legal precedent used by every Administration--Republican and Democratic--since President Eisenhower. Just as Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush did before him, President Obama took executive action to make our immigration system better meet the needs of our country and better reflect our values as Americans. As former Republican Senator Richard Lugar wrote in the New York Times: ``. . . whether or not you like President Obama's actions, he has operated under longstanding provisions of law that give the executive branch discretion in enforcement. This presidential prerogative has been recognized explicitly by the Supreme Court.'' Democrats stand for restoring sense to our utterly broken immigration system--so that we stop tearing apart families and separating parents from their children. Last month, House and Senate Democrats filed our own amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the President's Immigration Executive Actions. We are confident that the Supreme Court will affirm these vital immigration reforms and allow the President's steps to start fixing our immigration system to move forward. While Republicans stand with Donald Trump's incendiary anti-immigrant agenda, Democrats will continue to champion the comprehensive immigration reform our nation needs. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas. She raises several important points. One of the things that has struck me during my time here in Congress is that, under Republican reign, we have consistently seen government by crisis on one issue after the next. From the group of people that spend so much time messaging the point to the American people that they believe in fiscal responsibility, where is the fiscal responsibility in failing to put forth a budget consistent with the law that you supported? The other thing that amazes me--and the gentlewoman from Texas raised the point about the Supreme Court case that was argued earlier today on the immigration executive order issued by the President--I sit on the Judiciary Committee along with the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee and we hear almost every week about how lawless this President allegedly has been in terms of his time in office. Now, it is interesting to consistently hear the lectures about how lawless this President has allegedly been from people who believe that President Barack Obama exceeded his authority on January 20, 2009, the moment that he took the oath of office because there are folks who still cannot believe that this man is the President and leader of the free world. So I never buy that lawlessness argument. This is a group now that supports essentially undermining the Constitution over in the other house of this Congress. The President has done his job in putting forth the Supreme Court nominee, who is clearly qualified not according to Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but according to Orrin Hatch himself, one of the leading Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, amongst others. The lawlessness is not taking place at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is taking place right here in the United States Congress under the leadership of House and Senate Republicans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. JEFFRIES. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me just finish my point by saying that the reason why the budget is not here is because they could not muster the votes of the majority and they could not muster them even though their budget ended Medicare, it took $6.5 trillion in cuts from the overall budget, it devastated good-paying jobs, education, American infrastructure, and, again, it repealed the Affordable Care Act and dismantled the Affordable Care Act for 20 million people. Even with those poison pills to draw in support for some kind of budget that would fit within the law, their responsibility or the responsibility of Congress--they are in the majority--they could not pass or get on the floor a budget. Clearly, the moral compass is broken. More importantly, it denies equal protection under the law, in my interpretation, of millions of Americans depending on this Congress doing its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the thoughtful observations of the gentlewoman from Texas. I think we want to bring Representative Stacy Plaskett into this conversation in terms of the stunning inability to present a budget. As Representative Jackson Lee said, what else is there to do in terms of satisfying the extreme elements of your party? Privatize Social Security and throw older people out of their homes across the country? What else can you do? We are going to explore some of these draconian cuts that were in a budget that apparently is not extreme enough. I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), my good friend and colleague by way of Brooklyn, New York, I point out. We are so thankful for her presence here in the Congress. It is my honor now to yield to her. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries and I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for giving us this opportunity to always be the conscience of this Congress. I want to thank the gentleman for his tireless efforts to raise awareness on not just the Committee on the Judiciary, but all of the work that he does. This group has come together this evening to talk about the fact that once again the Republicans have created a road to ruin in their budget failure. We talked about the fact that this Republican Congress has blown past the statutory deadline to enact a budget last week, reflecting, apparently, the belief of the leadership that their already severe budget proposal was not even radical enough to pass through this Republican majority. The gentleman talked about some of the draconian measures that were already in the budget that they had proposed, which seems to have not been sufficient enough for their caucus. At the direction of the House GOP leadership, the Budget Committee put forth one of the most devastating budgets in history and the majority rejected that plan as insufficient, which can only lead us to believe that it was not even severe enough for them. Some of the things that were in that budget were an end to a Medicare guarantee for seniors, makes $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the House Budget Committee--devastates investments in good-paying jobs, education, and American infrastructure, repeals the Affordable Care Act and dismantling the affordable health care of 20 million Americans. Now, as expressed by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), in February, the administration, our President, requested support for Americans through the budget that he submitted to this Congress, which provided support for education, job training support, bolstering our obligation to seniors, real tools for growth for the territories in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and others by inclusion in the Affordable Care Act and expansion of Medicare. But it seems that the Republicans have failed their promise to pass a budget, never mind even listen to or hear the head of OMB on that budget. Their goal is still clear, to take us back to radical, trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy in the past and hollowed out the wages of middle-class Americans. At that same time, House Republicans have done nothing to help the thousands of Americans struggling to protect their families from the three public health crises the chief spoke of: Zika, the opioid addict addictions, and the Flint water crisis. In Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and now even Texas, this is a real crisis concerns the Zika virus. Last week, Democrats on the Appropriations Committee wrote to Chairman Hal Rogers requesting an immediate hearing on the administration's [[Page H1791]] 1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for Zika, pointing out that: ``The Zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the potential to affect millions of Americans this summer, including more than 2 million pregnant women.'' What did that committee do? Absolutely nothing. Not even the respect of a hearing. They have not responded to anything but just their inaction and indifference. {time} 2015 Instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public health crises, the House Republicans are now wasting a full week grandstanding on the IRS. That is just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the American people have come to expect from this Congress. Hardworking families deserve a Congress that invests in their future, protects their safety, creates a level playing field for them and their children to succeed. Democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs, raises the paychecks, creates opportunities for American people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. I look forward to hearing, with the rest of my colleagues, their thoughts on this budget process and even possibly solutions for us as American people to come away with a clear budget that creates growth and opportunities for Americans. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Plaskett. She raised several important points. She noted that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to embrace this notion of trickle-down economics, which is sort of the foundation of many of the slash-and- burn cuts that are contained in at least a budget document that has been passed in prior years and the document that was put forth by the Committee on the Budget this year, this belief that if you lower the tax rate for millionaires and billionaires, that it will result in some residual benefit to the American people. But there is an irony in the embrace even of that term, ``trickle-down economics.'' With the leadership of Representative Bobby Scott and others, the CBC has consistently put forth a budget designed to open the floodgates of prosperity for working class Americans and middle class folks all throughout this country, but what the Republicans want to do is trickle-down economics. The only thing that you get with that philosophy, you may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay down. We are thankful that Representative Scott for so many years has consistently put forth through his leadership a budget from the Congressional Black Caucus designed to be both fiscally responsible and consistent with our ideals as a country that looks out for the least of those amongst us. Let me now yield to the distinguished representative from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mr. Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for getting the title of our State correct. I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding and organizing tonight's Special Order. Last week, the House of Representatives failed to pass a budget by the statutorily mandated date of April 15. This failure is unfortunate for our budget process, but perhaps not unfortunate for the American people because no budget is better than the proposed Republican budget that would have been brought to the floor. Our Nation's budget reflects priorities, but the Republican budget only highlights the wrong priorities. The budget the House Republicans wanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to students, working families, and seniors than their previous proposals. The Republican budget would end the Medicare guarantee for seniors by converting Medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation, shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens. The Republican budget would repeal the Affordable Care Act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of Americans, even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the Affordable Care Act to pay for the Affordable Care Act, all of those taxes remain in the budget. The Republican budget includes a total of $6.5 trillion in spending cuts, largely unspecified. If this level of cuts were ever made, it would devastate our investments and jobs, education, research, and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects. On top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking American families, the Republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires, and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral, suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy. But despite this, the Republican budget is not a credible plan. Are we really going to dismantle Medicare? Are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation? Are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy? I don't think so. But the House leadership couldn't even secure enough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their conference wanted even deeper, unrealistic spending cuts. Budgeting is about making tough choices, and the only choice the Republicans seem to have made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the budget on the backs of students, workers, seniors, the disabled, and vulnerable communities across the Nation while cutting taxes for the wealthy. The Congressional Black Caucus knows that is not the right choice. That is why, as we have done for the last 30 years, we have diligently prepared our own budget alternative to the Republican budget, which we would have offered as an amendment to the Republican budget if they had brought up their proposal. The CBC budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow our economy and ensure that every American family is able to prosper. Our budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program, totaling $500 billion over 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that it reaches virtually every community in America while also investing in what will guarantee America's long-term economic competitiveness. This jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs, school modernization, jobs for teachers and first responders, immediate investments in our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, assistance for neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis, job training programs, and summer jobs. Our budget calls for significant and sustained investments-- approximately $300 billion over the next decade--above the President's request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of Americans out of poverty. Some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, expanding access to affordable housing, increasing access to quality and affordable education, increasing funding for job training and Trade Adjustment Assistance, adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation, as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age. Thanks to the leadership of Congressman Jim Clyburn, our budget also ensures that Federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting Federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through the 10-20-30 formula. Our budget also includes more than $340 billion above the President's request for education over the next decade. This additional money will help make college more affordable by increasing the Pell grant, fully funding the President's free community college program, reducing interest rates on student loans, and financing other proposals to ensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable debt. The CBC budget also provides much-needed funding for families of Flint, Michigan, to help address the short-term and long-term cognitive and behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels. However, the [[Page H1792]] Congressional Black Caucus appreciates, unfortunately, that Flint is not the only community in America impacted by lead exposure. This is why our budget includes funds to help not only Flint, but also other communities across the Nation deal with the effects of lead exposure. Unlike the Republican budget, the CBC budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments. Our budget sets a new revenue target of $4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline. To demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic, our budget suggests several specific alternatives, totaling $7 trillion, that the House and Senate committees can choose from to reach that target. We ask for $4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least $7 trillion to choose from. We do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes, treating capital gains and dividends as regular income, a reasonable fee for financial transactions, restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago, specific items where you can choose from and, in fact, if we just cancel the Bush-era tax cuts, we would have almost $4 trillion in new revenue right there. At the end of the day, our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately $3.2 trillion over the next decade compared to the Congressional Budget Office's March 2016 baseline. The CBC budget chooses investments in America's children and workers, protects our most vulnerable communities, and changes the wrong choices offered by the Republican majority. I hope that we will have an opportunity to debate these issues if the House Republicans are ever able to bring their road-to-ruin budget to a full House vote. Again, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. Mr. JEFFRIES. Would the gentleman indulge one question? It was mentioned during that very thorough presentation of what is contained in the CBC budget the 10-20-30 program, and of course 10-20- 30, an initiative that has been championed by the CBC through the leadership of Representative Jim Clyburn, would put forth a formula where 10 percent of the funding allocation would go to counties where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 or more years. Is that correct? Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is correct. If you look at that, those counties and areas are spread all over the country, and if we are ever going to eradicate poverty, we have to target it to the high poverty areas, and 10-20-30 does exactly that. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentleman. In fact, what Representative Clyburn has consistently pointed out, which I think is important in an era where we are trying to find common ground and deal with the problems confronting the American people, if you look at a breakdown of persistently poor counties across the country and overlay that with congressional districts, a majority of those counties are actually represented by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This is something that we believe should be embraced by the Speaker and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as it would benefit, by the numbers, the constituents that they represent even more so than those of us within the CBC or on this side of the aisle. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is exactly true. I thank the gentleman very much for pointing that out. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scott. Let me now ask my colleague, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), to just react to some of what we have heard. One of the things that I thought was interesting in the presentation related to this budget is that if you look at the numbers, they are so extreme. I was on the Committee on the Budget during my first 2 years in Congress, but these numbers are even more extreme than what I remember in the 113th Congress. The budget apparently will cut $157 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over a 10- year period. The Republican budget that came out of the committee would cut roughly $2 trillion from Medicaid. When I was on the committee, the number was $700 million. I thought that was out of control, $700 million. Now we are at $2 trillion over a 10-year period apparently. And then we have got cuts in higher education. The proposal is $185 billion over 10 years. You have to ask the question: Why would anyone propose such draconian cuts? The answer is clear. This is not something that is often talked about, but the objective is to create a situation where you can dramatically lower the tax rates for the wealthiest amongst us. The top tax rate right now is 39.6 percent, but what the budget that has been put forth by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would do is that it would create two tax rates, one at 10 and the other at 25 percent. So what you will see is a tax cut that goes from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. The way that you balance a budget and pay for it is on the backs of working families, the middle class, senior citizens, children, the disabled, the poor, the afflicted, and everybody else who doesn't fall into the category of millionaire or billionaire. {time} 2030 Now, you wonder how it could be possible that anyone could think that they could get away with such a draconian budget. Well, again, the argument is trickle-down economics. But what I found fascinating--and maybe you could react to this, Representative Beatty--is that if you actually look at a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under President Clinton with a side- by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under George W. Bush, and then a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under President Obama, I think it is pretty clear who actually has been the responsible fiscal stewards. There were 20.3 million jobs created under the Clinton Presidency. America lost 650,000 jobs in 8 years under the Bush Presidency. America has now gained more than 14 million private sector jobs under 8 years of the Obama Presidency. What has been demonstrated is that the argument that if you lower tax rates, you create economic prosperity, is phony. Because Bill Clinton raised the top tax rate to 39.6 percent. It didn't seem to adversely impact the economy. In fact, it was humming between 1992 and 2000. George Bush comes to office, lowers the tax rate for high-income earners from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. We had the greatest recession in the history of modern America; the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. President Obama comes into office and he raises the top tax rate again from 35 to 39.6, more than 14 million jobs are created, the unemployment rate has dropped under his tenure from over 10 percent to 5 percent, the deficit has been reduced by more than a trillion dollars. The stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. Now it is up to 18,000. I haven't been in the 401(k) system as long as Congressman Scott, who clearly is monitoring the situation. So the prosperity numbers have been phenomenal. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for her reaction. Mrs. BEATTY. I think Mr. Jeffries and our other colleagues have said it so well, but here is what I am afraid of. I think the Republicans--the GOP--want to take us down to the radical trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle class, hardworking Americans. You said it all with that comparison from Clinton to Bush to now President Obama. And I could add to that long list: some 18 million people with health insurance; women having some of the best healthcare opportunities, getting mammograms for those who are under- and uninsured. We are able to have college students stay on their parent's insurance. So I think when we look at what is happening, there are billions of dollars that they want to do away with in programs. And we can add to that: the $185 billion from Federal college aid for low-income students or the $150 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Many of my constituents refer to that as their food stamps. And certainly, but for the Congressional Black Caucus, those members on the Agriculture Committee, those Members in leadership fighting for us to restore those dollars, I think it is quite simple. [[Page H1793]] I think what we are hearing tonight from our members of the Congressional Black Caucus is that they are trying to take us back in history. They are trying to take us back to an era of time, and we are not going to let them do that. We have too much at stake. We have gained so much. Someone may ask us tonight: Why are we here? Why are we the conscience of the Congress, Mr. Speaker? Why are we here tonight talking about the road to ruin and destruction by not having a congressional budget? I think the facts speak for themselves. I think that the American public needs to know that this is not something that just affects the Congressional Black Caucus. I want that to be clear. This affects America. You mentioned it with Mr. Clyburn's 10-20-30. The fact is more individuals who don't look like members of the Congressional Black Caucus will benefit. And that is the difference between Democrats and Republicans. We care about all people. They profess to have hearings on poverty, and then when you look at the results of their own budget and what they are doing to those individuals who live in poverty--chuckle we may, clear our voice, Mr. Speaker, as we may--the facts speak for themselves. They are not creating programs that will help us eliminate poverty. And it is as simple as that. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank you for laying that out. And I think history can be judged by objective observers as it relates to fiscal responsibility. But a few facts that perhaps some in the Chamber may have had amnesia about, but maybe it bears going through. Sequestration and painful budget cuts as it relates to the extreme agenda of some here in the Congress have been brought to us in a manner that has cost us both jobs and the ability to experience accelerated financial growth. We saw in the aftermath of a severe economic shock the approach that was taken by our friends over in Europe of extreme austerity did not bear financial fruit. It was the stimulus package that was put forth-- with not a single vote from anyone on the other side of the aisle--that was actually the financially responsible approach taken to help deal with the train wreck that President Obama inherited and to get the economy back on track. But, of course, the objective from the very beginning--not my words, but the words of the Senate majority leader on the other side of the Capitol--was to make the President a one-term President. I just don't even understand the philosophy of a President who takes office, inherits the worst economy since the Great Depression, and the number one agenda is to make sure that he is a one-term President. But that was an unsuccessful political endeavor. He gets a second term. The first thing that some of my good friends on the other side of the aisle decide to do, as we approach the end of the fiscal year in 2013, was to shut down the government for 16 days. It cost us $24 billion in lost economic productivity. That is not hyperbole. Those are facts. And what was it all for? Because there is this obsession--perhaps clinical in nature--with the Affordable Care Act. This is why we voted more than 50 times to destroy it, defeat it, delay it, and do everything possible to stop it. What could be possibly wrong with making sure that preexisting conditions don't prevent someone here in the greatest country in the history of the world from being able to get adequate medical care? What is wrong with more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans actually having health care? Yet, in the budget that apparently is not extreme enough, we would take away the Affordable Care Act. So these are just some of the facts. I wish we had some more time to explore it. That is not hyperbole. Historians will judge this Presidency and this Congress. I, of course, am of the belief that many will conclude that this is a Congress that has majored in obstruction, minored in dysfunction, and done everything possible to pursue a degree in legislative malpractice to the detriment of the American people. And I am hopeful that we can just get back on track and try to find common ground to do the business of the American people, which is why each and every one of us was sent here to the people's House. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Republican controlled House has once again missed a key deadline when it failed to pass a budget resolution before April 15. Despite promises to the contrary, House Speaker Paul Ryan has been unable to bring a budget resolution to the floor in a timely fashion. This is simply unacceptable. Completing a budget resolution is an important step in the budget process that will lay out Congress' spending priorities and create a unified vision for a more prosperous nation. While Democrats have endeavored to work cooperatively with Republicans to pass a comprehensive budget resolution, Speaker Ryan has insisted on pushing a budget that divides our country while further slashing critical investments aimed at strengthening our economy. The Republican budget reflects the needs of only a select few instead of the views and priorities of every American and places the burden of deficit reduction squarely on the backs of middle and working class Americans. It is clear that our most vulnerable segments of the population--the elderly, minorities, low-income earners, and others--have been most impacted by the Great Recession. Yet this latest Republican budget resolution continues to reflect the failed economic worldview that wealth will trickle down when we give massive tax breaks to the wealthy. Time and time again, history has demonstrated that this is simply untrue. It is unfortunate that the Republican-controlled Congress today is subjecting millions of hard-working families to even greater pressures to work longer hours for less pay, while we continue to prop up the wealthiest earners and biggest corporations with tax breaks and other loopholes. The Republican budget exemplifies these principles and drives the wedge deeper between the wealthy and our most vulnerable. Mr. Speaker, I believe our nation is on a dangerous path under this Republican leadership. Congress should be working to create jobs and increase pay for hard-working American families, not giving additional tax breaks to the wealthy and cutting spending for key social programs The Republicans have long abandoned their commitment to pass a budget resolution that reflects the needs of all Americans. Thus, I am strongly urging my colleagues to support fiscally sound and morally responsible budget alternatives that will create a level playing field and new opportunities for every American. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). The Chair would remind Members that remarks in debate may not engage in personalities toward the President, including by repeating remarks made elsewhere that would be improper if spoken in the Member's own words. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1787-H1793] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS--ROAD TO RUIN: HOUSE REPUBLICANS FAIL ON THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege, once again, to come to the House floor on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and join with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, as we anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order--the CBC hour of power--where, for 60 minutes, we get an opportunity to talk to the American people about issues of great importance to the African American community, to our democracy, and, certainly, to our country at large. Today, we are here to discuss, tragically, the House GOP's continued failure to demonstrate the ability to govern in a basic fashion--that is to pass a budget, which is required by statutory law, as of April 15. That deadline has come and gone, and we are still waiting for the House majority to present a budget to this body for our consideration. We were told for years by people, including by the current Speaker of this great House, that the most fundamental tenet of governing is the passage of a budget. Yet, even with Republicans in firm control of both the House and the Senate, it seems that this Congress is still unable to get its act together. It is a stunning act of legislative abdication of basic responsibilities. We are going to explore that tonight, not just from a procedural standpoint, but from a standpoint of how this is indicative of this majority's unwillingness and inability to do the business of the American people. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to my distinguished colleague, my coanchor, my classmate--the always eloquent and effervescent gentlewoman from the great city of Columbus in the great State of Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank the gentleman. I always look forward to engaging in our Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour and, tonight, for our dialogue, for our debate, on the House Republicans' repeated failure to pass a budget. First, let me say, as your classmate and colleague, being able to be the voice for your constituents and my constituents and America at large, it is an honor. I think it is so important, when we think about how important the work of this Congress is, for us to take on challenging the House Republicans' road to ruin. Madam Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus is going to discuss the importance of why we should pass a budget. Not only that, I am sure Mr. Jeffries and I will have a dialogue about the value and the importance of having a budget. As Members of Congress and, especially, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, we know specifically that a budget creates jobs and that it raises the paychecks of hardworking American people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. Madam Speaker, let me just take a moment to point out that this is not [[Page H1788]] the first time that the Congressional Black Caucus has held a Special Order hour on the subject of the Republicans' inaction. Earlier this year, the Congressional Black Caucus came to this House floor and implored the Republican leadership to do its job--the job America wants us to do--and that was to enact commonsense gun control legislation. To date, Madam Speaker, Republicans have continued to fail the American people by putting forth or by bringing forth commonsense gun control legislation. It is still hanging out there, waiting for action. Now, again, here in the House of Representatives, the people's House, we are faced with another instance of Republican failure. Under law, as spelled out in title III of the Congressional Budget Act, Congress is directed to complete actions on the concurrent resolution on the budget by April 15, as we heard Mr. Jeffries remind us. A concurrent resolution on the budget means it is supposed to pass both the Senate and the House, again, by April 15. At this date, neither Chamber has considered a budget resolution for 2017. Madam Speaker, I don't know about your constituents, but in my district, Ohio's Third Congressional District, my constituents expect Congress to work; so let's take a look at it. What happens when people refuse to do their jobs? If postal workers don't deliver, you don't get your mail. If farmers don't farm, people don't eat. If teachers don't show up, our children don't learn. People all over America take their jobs seriously, and they expect us, as their elected officials, to also do that. It is time for House Republicans to get America off the road to ruin and back on the path to prosperity. When Speaker Ryan took office--this is worth repeating, and Congressman Jeffries mentioned this earlier. When Speaker Ryan took office, House Republicans stated that passing a budget was a basic function of government. However, the statutory deadline of passing a budget resolution by April 15 has come and gone, although House Republicans made passing a budget a top priority for this year. In the Republicans' own words, they can't even accomplish the basic functions of government--their job. Madam Speaker, why do we care that we don't have a budget? Let me give you the answer. The importance of setting a budget is that it lays out the blueprint for the appropriations process. It outlines government spending for the year. Without a budget, we have 12 appropriations bills that are working their way through Congress without there being guiding principles on overall spending. If we cannot as a Congress perform the basic functions of governing, how are we going to tackle the much more complicated issues, such as income inequality, education quality, tuition affordability, tax reform, and so many others? Once again, House Republicans have demonstrated the degree to which the sharp division within their Conference is impeding Congress' ability to work for the American people. Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hardworking American families, they have just decided not to pass a budget. This decision was made despite the fact that President Obama submitted his budget request to Congress back in February. As you may remember, Madam Speaker, the Republican majority here in the House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate took the unprecedented step of refusing to receive the OMB Director for a formal hearing so as to present the President's budget. Madam Speaker, how did that turn out for us? We all know how it turned out. The Republican Conference failed the American people, and it set us on a road to ruin by not passing a budget. Mr. Jeffries, I look forward to our continuing this dialogue tonight with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank Congresswoman Beatty for a very thorough presentation and for pointing out that the Speaker, himself, and the Republican majority have indicated that they should be judged based on their capacity to complete the basics of their job responsibilities, which include the passage of a budget resolution. In fact, it was then- Congressman Ryan who, in 2012, stated that failing to enact a budget has serious consequences for American families. There are at least three current health crises that we are trying to deal with in America and throughout the world, but Republicans have abdicated their responsibility: the Zika virus, the Flint water crisis, and the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner cities, in suburban America, and all throughout the rural parts of this country; yet House Republicans have failed not just to put forth a budget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues, but they have chosen to simply ignore these crises in a manner that represents such a stunning departure of what responsible Members of Congress should be doing at this particular point in time. I am thankful that we have been joined by the distinguished gentlewoman from the great Lone Star State, who has always been thoughtful and eloquent on issues of importance not just to her district, which is anchored in Houston, Texas, but through her membership and leadership on the Homeland Security Committee as well as on the House Judiciary Committee. She has been so thoughtful and effective on a great many issues in the context of our safety, of our well-being, of criminal justice reform, of course, and of the protection of civil liberties--all issues that are fundamental to our democracy in the same way that a budgetary roadmap is fundamental to our democracy. Let me yield to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank my colleagues for their eloquence but, more importantly, for the Congressional Black Caucus in its taking up the mantle of the moral compass of justice. One would argue that justice is tied to our committee, the Judiciary Committee; but as I look at this Congress and as I look at a very small document called the Constitution, one can anchor the responsibilities of this body--of both the House and the Senate--Mr. Jeffries, in the Bill of Rights. I would like to just, very briefly, take us on a journey that indicates that our moral compass is broken because a budget that was supposed to be passed on April 15, by midnight, was not. To the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, let me thank her. She will have her own distinctive story, in her eloquence, about the fairness to the territories. I listened, as I came in, to the presentation by the gentlewoman from Ohio, who knows full well that we need a budget to ensure that there is full employment in America. Then I work extensively with my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, and we will not pass or fund prison reform without a budget. I rise today, however, to weave in and out of my comments about the moral compass that is broken to indicate that my district--the 18th Congressional District in Houston, Texas, and Harris County--is under a terrible emergency disaster. We are underwater. We are again facing an enormous rainfall that has been listed as historic and, possibly, as catastrophic. Let me acknowledge my mayor, Mayor Turner, and county judge, Judge Emmett, for the work that has been done so far; and let me indicate two pastors with whom I have just gotten off the phone, Bishop Dixon and Bishop Bady, who are watching hungry people come to a site, looking for food. {time} 2000 As I was speaking to the emergency leadership, they are indicating they were evacuating babies from apartments and people were being displaced. So what does that have to do with where we are today and no budget? Well, we know that the President introduced his budget a few months ago. Because of his responsibility, we know that Homeland Security was provided funding and FEMA was provided funding to deal with emergency declarations of a disaster. My district now needs it more than they have ever needed it. They need it in terms of providing for those immediate needs of vulnerable people without the resources to have stocked food, medical care, clothing, and also those who may be off work now because of the disaster. So we don't have a budget. We are not moving along to ensure that [[Page H1789]] FEMA, which has seen a lot of disasters over the last 2 years, has the necessary funding to do their job. That is a broken moral compass. It also reflects the Constitution because we are owed an equal treatment under the law and due process under the Fifth Amendment. There is no due process when I hear that one area is under water and we are not able to get help. Let me also say that, as I watch a broken moral system, I also look at the predicament that we will be in with the Zika virus. Congressman Jeffries has mentioned the opioid crisis, and we cannot forget the water crisis in Flint, but there is also the water crisis across the Nation. There is hard work that is being done by the Members in Michigan and Mr. Kildee. They need a budget to be able to fund the crisis or to help repair the crisis, restorative dollars, that a budget does to give a roadmap to the appropriators. I also know that we are facing another potential epidemic, if you will, the Zika virus that is taking control of places like Puerto Rico and other places in the Caribbean, places that we have not yet fully documented. I can assure you that the Gulf Coast States of Florida, Louisiana, and Texas are in the eye of the storm. The President a couple of months ago dutifully and responsibly introduced to this Congress a request of $1.9 billion--no, I didn't say trillions. I didn't say 5 billion. I said 1.9 billion--so that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can do their job. Mr. Jeffries, colleagues, if we are not doing our job, we need those who have the distinctive responsibility for issues of health and epidemics in this country to be able to do their job. We have now been told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it is not just in the prestages of pregnancy that the Zika virus can have a severe impact. It is throughout the pregnancy. We also know that they have just determined that it will be severe brain damage that will come about. So how irresponsible can it be to not put forward the emergency supplemental of $1.9 billion? I have sent letters to Secretary Burwell. I have sent letters to, obviously, the President of the United States in supporting his efforts. I have sent letters to our leader, Nancy Pelosi, who has been a champion on these issues of Zika funding. And I have sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan. Might I speak to the Speaker and certainly ask that a half-baked, if I might say, contribution to fighting the Zika virus is not going to work because any taking of monies from other places is going to damage the funding of malaria, tuberculosis, and a universal flu vaccine. Yes, it is going to undermine our needed and continued effort of fighting Ebola. Let me finish by simply saying this: Along with the idea of the Zika virus and other crises, when we hear headlines like this that indicate Americans still don't see a vibrant labor market, then you know what else is needed under this budget? We need a budget to be able to fully fund the retraining of Americans. I have introduced legislation that will train middle-age or middle- management workers and others and give them a stipend while they are being retrained for the 21st century jobs. We cannot do that with a budget not passed and an assessment not being made on how we would fund job training. Lastly, the Supreme Court heard a case today dealing with the issues of executive orders and immigration. I would argue that Texas and the other States do not have standing because they are not required to give driver's licenses or anything else, as the President provides a prioritization of who should be deported. I will say to you that, over the years, we have said over and over again to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which could have been a key element of a budget revenue to be able to help this country move along. Without a budget and an intelligent discussion about what comprehensive immigration reform would do as an added revenue for this country, here we are mumbling along while Houston remains under water, needing resources from FEMA, while the Zika virus is in distress with no monies and while a number of other important issues are not addressed. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jeffries for allowing me to spend a moment to at least tie in the Bill of Rights that deal with the very core values of this country. We have let down that basic document that guarantees equal protection, guarantees a certain freedom to be protected, guarantees that Americans have due process, if you will, and certainly guarantees the freedom of expression so that Americans can speak and be heard. They are speaking, but they are not being heard. What a shame that this budget has not been passed. I am grateful to the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me acknowledge the chairman and say: Let us keep our fight going because we have reason to provide that kind of comfort to the American people. Madam Speaker, Last week, House Republicans blew past the statutory deadline for Congress to enact a budget--reflecting apparently the belief of the Leadership that their already severe budget proposal was not radical enough to pass through a Republican Majority. The Do-Nothing Republican Congress is back. Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hard-working American families, Republicans have decided not to pass a budget at all. The Republican-led Budget Committee, at the direction of the House GOP Leadership, put forward the most devastating `Road to Ruin' budget in history, but the Republican majority has rejected the plan as insufficiently severe. Here's what was too weak to satisfy the radical forces that have seized control of the Republican Party; a budget that would: 1. End the Medicare guarantee for seniors; 2. Make $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the House Budget Committee; 3. Devastate investments in good-paying jobs, education, and American infrastructure; 4. Repeal the Affordable Care Act and dismantle the affordable health care of 20 million Americans. Republicans have failed to keep their promise to pass a budget but their goal is still clear: to take us back to the radical trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle- class Americans. At the same time, House Republicans have done nothing to help the thousands of Americans struggling to protect their families from the three public health emergencies of the Zika virus, opioid addiction and the Flint Water Crisis: 1. As the House Democratic Leadership wrote to Speaker Ryan last month, these public health crises require swift and decisive Congressional action. 2. Also last week, Democrats on the Appropriations Committee wrote to Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY), requesting an immediate hearing on the Administration's $1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for Zika, pointing out that ``The Zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the potential to affect millions of Americans this summer, including more than two million pregnant women.'' 3. But House Republicans have responded with nothing but inaction and indifference. Instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public health crises, House Republicans are now wasting a full week grandstanding on the IRS. That's just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the American people have come to expect from the Do-Nothing Republican Congress. As NPR notes: Under Republican leadership, the 114th Congress has been ``short on meaty legislation and short on weeks in session . . . But there seems to be plenty of time to think about other things. Last month, one House member introduced a measure that would nationally recognized magic as an art form.'' Hard-working families deserve a Congress that invests in their future, protects safety, and creates a level-playing field for them and their children to succeed. Democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs and raises the paychecks of the American people, while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. Today, the Supreme -Court heard oral arguments in its review of the President's Immigration Executive Actions, which, as a result of congressional Republicans' inaction, address our Nation's broken immigration system and set important priorities in enforcing our immigration laws. The President's executive actions fall well within both the clear legal authority provided by Congress and the Constitution, and the [[Page H1790]] well-established precedents of immigration actions by every Democrat and Republican President for the last 50 years. 1. Six Republican presidents have used the same clear authority to make our immigration enforcement priorities better fit our values as a people and our needs as a nation; 2. Past presidents have routinely acted in the face of Congressional inaction; 3. Numerous noted legal scholars have found that the President's actions are well within his legal authority. The Immigration Executive Actions follow the same constitutional and legal precedent used by every Administration--Republican and Democratic--since President Eisenhower. Just as Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush did before him, President Obama took executive action to make our immigration system better meet the needs of our country and better reflect our values as Americans. As former Republican Senator Richard Lugar wrote in the New York Times: ``. . . whether or not you like President Obama's actions, he has operated under longstanding provisions of law that give the executive branch discretion in enforcement. This presidential prerogative has been recognized explicitly by the Supreme Court.'' Democrats stand for restoring sense to our utterly broken immigration system--so that we stop tearing apart families and separating parents from their children. Last month, House and Senate Democrats filed our own amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the President's Immigration Executive Actions. We are confident that the Supreme Court will affirm these vital immigration reforms and allow the President's steps to start fixing our immigration system to move forward. While Republicans stand with Donald Trump's incendiary anti-immigrant agenda, Democrats will continue to champion the comprehensive immigration reform our nation needs. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas. She raises several important points. One of the things that has struck me during my time here in Congress is that, under Republican reign, we have consistently seen government by crisis on one issue after the next. From the group of people that spend so much time messaging the point to the American people that they believe in fiscal responsibility, where is the fiscal responsibility in failing to put forth a budget consistent with the law that you supported? The other thing that amazes me--and the gentlewoman from Texas raised the point about the Supreme Court case that was argued earlier today on the immigration executive order issued by the President--I sit on the Judiciary Committee along with the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee and we hear almost every week about how lawless this President allegedly has been in terms of his time in office. Now, it is interesting to consistently hear the lectures about how lawless this President has allegedly been from people who believe that President Barack Obama exceeded his authority on January 20, 2009, the moment that he took the oath of office because there are folks who still cannot believe that this man is the President and leader of the free world. So I never buy that lawlessness argument. This is a group now that supports essentially undermining the Constitution over in the other house of this Congress. The President has done his job in putting forth the Supreme Court nominee, who is clearly qualified not according to Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but according to Orrin Hatch himself, one of the leading Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, amongst others. The lawlessness is not taking place at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is taking place right here in the United States Congress under the leadership of House and Senate Republicans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. JEFFRIES. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me just finish my point by saying that the reason why the budget is not here is because they could not muster the votes of the majority and they could not muster them even though their budget ended Medicare, it took $6.5 trillion in cuts from the overall budget, it devastated good-paying jobs, education, American infrastructure, and, again, it repealed the Affordable Care Act and dismantled the Affordable Care Act for 20 million people. Even with those poison pills to draw in support for some kind of budget that would fit within the law, their responsibility or the responsibility of Congress--they are in the majority--they could not pass or get on the floor a budget. Clearly, the moral compass is broken. More importantly, it denies equal protection under the law, in my interpretation, of millions of Americans depending on this Congress doing its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the thoughtful observations of the gentlewoman from Texas. I think we want to bring Representative Stacy Plaskett into this conversation in terms of the stunning inability to present a budget. As Representative Jackson Lee said, what else is there to do in terms of satisfying the extreme elements of your party? Privatize Social Security and throw older people out of their homes across the country? What else can you do? We are going to explore some of these draconian cuts that were in a budget that apparently is not extreme enough. I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), my good friend and colleague by way of Brooklyn, New York, I point out. We are so thankful for her presence here in the Congress. It is my honor now to yield to her. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries and I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for giving us this opportunity to always be the conscience of this Congress. I want to thank the gentleman for his tireless efforts to raise awareness on not just the Committee on the Judiciary, but all of the work that he does. This group has come together this evening to talk about the fact that once again the Republicans have created a road to ruin in their budget failure. We talked about the fact that this Republican Congress has blown past the statutory deadline to enact a budget last week, reflecting, apparently, the belief of the leadership that their already severe budget proposal was not even radical enough to pass through this Republican majority. The gentleman talked about some of the draconian measures that were already in the budget that they had proposed, which seems to have not been sufficient enough for their caucus. At the direction of the House GOP leadership, the Budget Committee put forth one of the most devastating budgets in history and the majority rejected that plan as insufficient, which can only lead us to believe that it was not even severe enough for them. Some of the things that were in that budget were an end to a Medicare guarantee for seniors, makes $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the House Budget Committee--devastates investments in good-paying jobs, education, and American infrastructure, repeals the Affordable Care Act and dismantling the affordable health care of 20 million Americans. Now, as expressed by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), in February, the administration, our President, requested support for Americans through the budget that he submitted to this Congress, which provided support for education, job training support, bolstering our obligation to seniors, real tools for growth for the territories in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and others by inclusion in the Affordable Care Act and expansion of Medicare. But it seems that the Republicans have failed their promise to pass a budget, never mind even listen to or hear the head of OMB on that budget. Their goal is still clear, to take us back to radical, trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy in the past and hollowed out the wages of middle-class Americans. At that same time, House Republicans have done nothing to help the thousands of Americans struggling to protect their families from the three public health crises the chief spoke of: Zika, the opioid addict addictions, and the Flint water crisis. In Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and now even Texas, this is a real crisis concerns the Zika virus. Last week, Democrats on the Appropriations Committee wrote to Chairman Hal Rogers requesting an immediate hearing on the administration's [[Page H1791]] 1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for Zika, pointing out that: ``The Zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the potential to affect millions of Americans this summer, including more than 2 million pregnant women.'' What did that committee do? Absolutely nothing. Not even the respect of a hearing. They have not responded to anything but just their inaction and indifference. {time} 2015 Instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public health crises, the House Republicans are now wasting a full week grandstanding on the IRS. That is just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the American people have come to expect from this Congress. Hardworking families deserve a Congress that invests in their future, protects their safety, creates a level playing field for them and their children to succeed. Democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs, raises the paychecks, creates opportunities for American people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. I look forward to hearing, with the rest of my colleagues, their thoughts on this budget process and even possibly solutions for us as American people to come away with a clear budget that creates growth and opportunities for Americans. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Plaskett. She raised several important points. She noted that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to embrace this notion of trickle-down economics, which is sort of the foundation of many of the slash-and- burn cuts that are contained in at least a budget document that has been passed in prior years and the document that was put forth by the Committee on the Budget this year, this belief that if you lower the tax rate for millionaires and billionaires, that it will result in some residual benefit to the American people. But there is an irony in the embrace even of that term, ``trickle-down economics.'' With the leadership of Representative Bobby Scott and others, the CBC has consistently put forth a budget designed to open the floodgates of prosperity for working class Americans and middle class folks all throughout this country, but what the Republicans want to do is trickle-down economics. The only thing that you get with that philosophy, you may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay down. We are thankful that Representative Scott for so many years has consistently put forth through his leadership a budget from the Congressional Black Caucus designed to be both fiscally responsible and consistent with our ideals as a country that looks out for the least of those amongst us. Let me now yield to the distinguished representative from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mr. Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for getting the title of our State correct. I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding and organizing tonight's Special Order. Last week, the House of Representatives failed to pass a budget by the statutorily mandated date of April 15. This failure is unfortunate for our budget process, but perhaps not unfortunate for the American people because no budget is better than the proposed Republican budget that would have been brought to the floor. Our Nation's budget reflects priorities, but the Republican budget only highlights the wrong priorities. The budget the House Republicans wanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to students, working families, and seniors than their previous proposals. The Republican budget would end the Medicare guarantee for seniors by converting Medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation, shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens. The Republican budget would repeal the Affordable Care Act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of Americans, even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the Affordable Care Act to pay for the Affordable Care Act, all of those taxes remain in the budget. The Republican budget includes a total of $6.5 trillion in spending cuts, largely unspecified. If this level of cuts were ever made, it would devastate our investments and jobs, education, research, and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects. On top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking American families, the Republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires, and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral, suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy. But despite this, the Republican budget is not a credible plan. Are we really going to dismantle Medicare? Are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation? Are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy? I don't think so. But the House leadership couldn't even secure enough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their conference wanted even deeper, unrealistic spending cuts. Budgeting is about making tough choices, and the only choice the Republicans seem to have made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the budget on the backs of students, workers, seniors, the disabled, and vulnerable communities across the Nation while cutting taxes for the wealthy. The Congressional Black Caucus knows that is not the right choice. That is why, as we have done for the last 30 years, we have diligently prepared our own budget alternative to the Republican budget, which we would have offered as an amendment to the Republican budget if they had brought up their proposal. The CBC budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow our economy and ensure that every American family is able to prosper. Our budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program, totaling $500 billion over 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that it reaches virtually every community in America while also investing in what will guarantee America's long-term economic competitiveness. This jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs, school modernization, jobs for teachers and first responders, immediate investments in our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, assistance for neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis, job training programs, and summer jobs. Our budget calls for significant and sustained investments-- approximately $300 billion over the next decade--above the President's request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of Americans out of poverty. Some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, expanding access to affordable housing, increasing access to quality and affordable education, increasing funding for job training and Trade Adjustment Assistance, adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation, as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age. Thanks to the leadership of Congressman Jim Clyburn, our budget also ensures that Federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting Federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through the 10-20-30 formula. Our budget also includes more than $340 billion above the President's request for education over the next decade. This additional money will help make college more affordable by increasing the Pell grant, fully funding the President's free community college program, reducing interest rates on student loans, and financing other proposals to ensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable debt. The CBC budget also provides much-needed funding for families of Flint, Michigan, to help address the short-term and long-term cognitive and behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels. However, the [[Page H1792]] Congressional Black Caucus appreciates, unfortunately, that Flint is not the only community in America impacted by lead exposure. This is why our budget includes funds to help not only Flint, but also other communities across the Nation deal with the effects of lead exposure. Unlike the Republican budget, the CBC budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments. Our budget sets a new revenue target of $4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline. To demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic, our budget suggests several specific alternatives, totaling $7 trillion, that the House and Senate committees can choose from to reach that target. We ask for $4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least $7 trillion to choose from. We do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes, treating capital gains and dividends as regular income, a reasonable fee for financial transactions, restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago, specific items where you can choose from and, in fact, if we just cancel the Bush-era tax cuts, we would have almost $4 trillion in new revenue right there. At the end of the day, our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately $3.2 trillion over the next decade compared to the Congressional Budget Office's March 2016 baseline. The CBC budget chooses investments in America's children and workers, protects our most vulnerable communities, and changes the wrong choices offered by the Republican majority. I hope that we will have an opportunity to debate these issues if the House Republicans are ever able to bring their road-to-ruin budget to a full House vote. Again, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. Mr. JEFFRIES. Would the gentleman indulge one question? It was mentioned during that very thorough presentation of what is contained in the CBC budget the 10-20-30 program, and of course 10-20- 30, an initiative that has been championed by the CBC through the leadership of Representative Jim Clyburn, would put forth a formula where 10 percent of the funding allocation would go to counties where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 or more years. Is that correct? Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is correct. If you look at that, those counties and areas are spread all over the country, and if we are ever going to eradicate poverty, we have to target it to the high poverty areas, and 10-20-30 does exactly that. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentleman. In fact, what Representative Clyburn has consistently pointed out, which I think is important in an era where we are trying to find common ground and deal with the problems confronting the American people, if you look at a breakdown of persistently poor counties across the country and overlay that with congressional districts, a majority of those counties are actually represented by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This is something that we believe should be embraced by the Speaker and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as it would benefit, by the numbers, the constituents that they represent even more so than those of us within the CBC or on this side of the aisle. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is exactly true. I thank the gentleman very much for pointing that out. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scott. Let me now ask my colleague, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), to just react to some of what we have heard. One of the things that I thought was interesting in the presentation related to this budget is that if you look at the numbers, they are so extreme. I was on the Committee on the Budget during my first 2 years in Congress, but these numbers are even more extreme than what I remember in the 113th Congress. The budget apparently will cut $157 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over a 10- year period. The Republican budget that came out of the committee would cut roughly $2 trillion from Medicaid. When I was on the committee, the number was $700 million. I thought that was out of control, $700 million. Now we are at $2 trillion over a 10-year period apparently. And then we have got cuts in higher education. The proposal is $185 billion over 10 years. You have to ask the question: Why would anyone propose such draconian cuts? The answer is clear. This is not something that is often talked about, but the objective is to create a situation where you can dramatically lower the tax rates for the wealthiest amongst us. The top tax rate right now is 39.6 percent, but what the budget that has been put forth by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would do is that it would create two tax rates, one at 10 and the other at 25 percent. So what you will see is a tax cut that goes from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. The way that you balance a budget and pay for it is on the backs of working families, the middle class, senior citizens, children, the disabled, the poor, the afflicted, and everybody else who doesn't fall into the category of millionaire or billionaire. {time} 2030 Now, you wonder how it could be possible that anyone could think that they could get away with such a draconian budget. Well, again, the argument is trickle-down economics. But what I found fascinating--and maybe you could react to this, Representative Beatty--is that if you actually look at a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under President Clinton with a side- by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under George W. Bush, and then a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under President Obama, I think it is pretty clear who actually has been the responsible fiscal stewards. There were 20.3 million jobs created under the Clinton Presidency. America lost 650,000 jobs in 8 years under the Bush Presidency. America has now gained more than 14 million private sector jobs under 8 years of the Obama Presidency. What has been demonstrated is that the argument that if you lower tax rates, you create economic prosperity, is phony. Because Bill Clinton raised the top tax rate to 39.6 percent. It didn't seem to adversely impact the economy. In fact, it was humming between 1992 and 2000. George Bush comes to office, lowers the tax rate for high-income earners from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. We had the greatest recession in the history of modern America; the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. President Obama comes into office and he raises the top tax rate again from 35 to 39.6, more than 14 million jobs are created, the unemployment rate has dropped under his tenure from over 10 percent to 5 percent, the deficit has been reduced by more than a trillion dollars. The stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. Now it is up to 18,000. I haven't been in the 401(k) system as long as Congressman Scott, who clearly is monitoring the situation. So the prosperity numbers have been phenomenal. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for her reaction. Mrs. BEATTY. I think Mr. Jeffries and our other colleagues have said it so well, but here is what I am afraid of. I think the Republicans--the GOP--want to take us down to the radical trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle class, hardworking Americans. You said it all with that comparison from Clinton to Bush to now President Obama. And I could add to that long list: some 18 million people with health insurance; women having some of the best healthcare opportunities, getting mammograms for those who are under- and uninsured. We are able to have college students stay on their parent's insurance. So I think when we look at what is happening, there are billions of dollars that they want to do away with in programs. And we can add to that: the $185 billion from Federal college aid for low-income students or the $150 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Many of my constituents refer to that as their food stamps. And certainly, but for the Congressional Black Caucus, those members on the Agriculture Committee, those Members in leadership fighting for us to restore those dollars, I think it is quite simple. [[Page H1793]] I think what we are hearing tonight from our members of the Congressional Black Caucus is that they are trying to take us back in history. They are trying to take us back to an era of time, and we are not going to let them do that. We have too much at stake. We have gained so much. Someone may ask us tonight: Why are we here? Why are we the conscience of the Congress, Mr. Speaker? Why are we here tonight talking about the road to ruin and destruction by not having a congressional budget? I think the facts speak for themselves. I think that the American public needs to know that this is not something that just affects the Congressional Black Caucus. I want that to be clear. This affects America. You mentioned it with Mr. Clyburn's 10-20-30. The fact is more individuals who don't look like members of the Congressional Black Caucus will benefit. And that is the difference between Democrats and Republicans. We care about all people. They profess to have hearings on poverty, and then when you look at the results of their own budget and what they are doing to those individuals who live in poverty--chuckle we may, clear our voice, Mr. Speaker, as we may--the facts speak for themselves. They are not creating programs that will help us eliminate poverty. And it is as simple as that. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank you for laying that out. And I think history can be judged by objective observers as it relates to fiscal responsibility. But a few facts that perhaps some in the Chamber may have had amnesia about, but maybe it bears going through. Sequestration and painful budget cuts as it relates to the extreme agenda of some here in the Congress have been brought to us in a manner that has cost us both jobs and the ability to experience accelerated financial growth. We saw in the aftermath of a severe economic shock the approach that was taken by our friends over in Europe of extreme austerity did not bear financial fruit. It was the stimulus package that was put forth-- with not a single vote from anyone on the other side of the aisle--that was actually the financially responsible approach taken to help deal with the train wreck that President Obama inherited and to get the economy back on track. But, of course, the objective from the very beginning--not my words, but the words of the Senate majority leader on the other side of the Capitol--was to make the President a one-term President. I just don't even understand the philosophy of a President who takes office, inherits the worst economy since the Great Depression, and the number one agenda is to make sure that he is a one-term President. But that was an unsuccessful political endeavor. He gets a second term. The first thing that some of my good friends on the other side of the aisle decide to do, as we approach the end of the fiscal year in 2013, was to shut down the government for 16 days. It cost us $24 billion in lost economic productivity. That is not hyperbole. Those are facts. And what was it all for? Because there is this obsession--perhaps clinical in nature--with the Affordable Care Act. This is why we voted more than 50 times to destroy it, defeat it, delay it, and do everything possible to stop it. What could be possibly wrong with making sure that preexisting conditions don't prevent someone here in the greatest country in the history of the world from being able to get adequate medical care? What is wrong with more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans actually having health care? Yet, in the budget that apparently is not extreme enough, we would take away the Affordable Care Act. So these are just some of the facts. I wish we had some more time to explore it. That is not hyperbole. Historians will judge this Presidency and this Congress. I, of course, am of the belief that many will conclude that this is a Congress that has majored in obstruction, minored in dysfunction, and done everything possible to pursue a degree in legislative malpractice to the detriment of the American people. And I am hopeful that we can just get back on track and try to find common ground to do the business of the American people, which is why each and every one of us was sent here to the people's House. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Republican controlled House has once again missed a key deadline when it failed to pass a budget resolution before April 15. Despite promises to the contrary, House Speaker Paul Ryan has been unable to bring a budget resolution to the floor in a timely fashion. This is simply unacceptable. Completing a budget resolution is an important step in the budget process that will lay out Congress' spending priorities and create a unified vision for a more prosperous nation. While Democrats have endeavored to work cooperatively with Republicans to pass a comprehensive budget resolution, Speaker Ryan has insisted on pushing a budget that divides our country while further slashing critical investments aimed at strengthening our economy. The Republican budget reflects the needs of only a select few instead of the views and priorities of every American and places the burden of deficit reduction squarely on the backs of middle and working class Americans. It is clear that our most vulnerable segments of the population--the elderly, minorities, low-income earners, and others--have been most impacted by the Great Recession. Yet this latest Republican budget resolution continues to reflect the failed economic worldview that wealth will trickle down when we give massive tax breaks to the wealthy. Time and time again, history has demonstrated that this is simply untrue. It is unfortunate that the Republican-controlled Congress today is subjecting millions of hard-working families to even greater pressures to work longer hours for less pay, while we continue to prop up the wealthiest earners and biggest corporations with tax breaks and other loopholes. The Republican budget exemplifies these principles and drives the wedge deeper between the wealthy and our most vulnerable. Mr. Speaker, I believe our nation is on a dangerous path under this Republican leadership. Congress should be working to create jobs and increase pay for hard-working American families, not giving additional tax breaks to the wealthy and cutting spending for key social programs The Republicans have long abandoned their commitment to pass a budget resolution that reflects the needs of all Americans. Thus, I am strongly urging my colleagues to support fiscally sound and morally responsible budget alternatives that will create a level playing field and new opportunities for every American. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). The Chair would remind Members that remarks in debate may not engage in personalities toward the President, including by repeating remarks made elsewhere that would be improper if spoken in the Member's own words. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1787-H1793] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS--ROAD TO RUIN: HOUSE REPUBLICANS FAIL ON THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege, once again, to come to the House floor on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and join with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, as we anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order--the CBC hour of power--where, for 60 minutes, we get an opportunity to talk to the American people about issues of great importance to the African American community, to our democracy, and, certainly, to our country at large. Today, we are here to discuss, tragically, the House GOP's continued failure to demonstrate the ability to govern in a basic fashion--that is to pass a budget, which is required by statutory law, as of April 15. That deadline has come and gone, and we are still waiting for the House majority to present a budget to this body for our consideration. We were told for years by people, including by the current Speaker of this great House, that the most fundamental tenet of governing is the passage of a budget. Yet, even with Republicans in firm control of both the House and the Senate, it seems that this Congress is still unable to get its act together. It is a stunning act of legislative abdication of basic responsibilities. We are going to explore that tonight, not just from a procedural standpoint, but from a standpoint of how this is indicative of this majority's unwillingness and inability to do the business of the American people. It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to my distinguished colleague, my coanchor, my classmate--the always eloquent and effervescent gentlewoman from the great city of Columbus in the great State of Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty. Mrs. BEATTY. I thank the gentleman. I always look forward to engaging in our Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour and, tonight, for our dialogue, for our debate, on the House Republicans' repeated failure to pass a budget. First, let me say, as your classmate and colleague, being able to be the voice for your constituents and my constituents and America at large, it is an honor. I think it is so important, when we think about how important the work of this Congress is, for us to take on challenging the House Republicans' road to ruin. Madam Speaker, tonight, the Congressional Black Caucus is going to discuss the importance of why we should pass a budget. Not only that, I am sure Mr. Jeffries and I will have a dialogue about the value and the importance of having a budget. As Members of Congress and, especially, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, we know specifically that a budget creates jobs and that it raises the paychecks of hardworking American people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. Madam Speaker, let me just take a moment to point out that this is not [[Page H1788]] the first time that the Congressional Black Caucus has held a Special Order hour on the subject of the Republicans' inaction. Earlier this year, the Congressional Black Caucus came to this House floor and implored the Republican leadership to do its job--the job America wants us to do--and that was to enact commonsense gun control legislation. To date, Madam Speaker, Republicans have continued to fail the American people by putting forth or by bringing forth commonsense gun control legislation. It is still hanging out there, waiting for action. Now, again, here in the House of Representatives, the people's House, we are faced with another instance of Republican failure. Under law, as spelled out in title III of the Congressional Budget Act, Congress is directed to complete actions on the concurrent resolution on the budget by April 15, as we heard Mr. Jeffries remind us. A concurrent resolution on the budget means it is supposed to pass both the Senate and the House, again, by April 15. At this date, neither Chamber has considered a budget resolution for 2017. Madam Speaker, I don't know about your constituents, but in my district, Ohio's Third Congressional District, my constituents expect Congress to work; so let's take a look at it. What happens when people refuse to do their jobs? If postal workers don't deliver, you don't get your mail. If farmers don't farm, people don't eat. If teachers don't show up, our children don't learn. People all over America take their jobs seriously, and they expect us, as their elected officials, to also do that. It is time for House Republicans to get America off the road to ruin and back on the path to prosperity. When Speaker Ryan took office--this is worth repeating, and Congressman Jeffries mentioned this earlier. When Speaker Ryan took office, House Republicans stated that passing a budget was a basic function of government. However, the statutory deadline of passing a budget resolution by April 15 has come and gone, although House Republicans made passing a budget a top priority for this year. In the Republicans' own words, they can't even accomplish the basic functions of government--their job. Madam Speaker, why do we care that we don't have a budget? Let me give you the answer. The importance of setting a budget is that it lays out the blueprint for the appropriations process. It outlines government spending for the year. Without a budget, we have 12 appropriations bills that are working their way through Congress without there being guiding principles on overall spending. If we cannot as a Congress perform the basic functions of governing, how are we going to tackle the much more complicated issues, such as income inequality, education quality, tuition affordability, tax reform, and so many others? Once again, House Republicans have demonstrated the degree to which the sharp division within their Conference is impeding Congress' ability to work for the American people. Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hardworking American families, they have just decided not to pass a budget. This decision was made despite the fact that President Obama submitted his budget request to Congress back in February. As you may remember, Madam Speaker, the Republican majority here in the House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate took the unprecedented step of refusing to receive the OMB Director for a formal hearing so as to present the President's budget. Madam Speaker, how did that turn out for us? We all know how it turned out. The Republican Conference failed the American people, and it set us on a road to ruin by not passing a budget. Mr. Jeffries, I look forward to our continuing this dialogue tonight with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank Congresswoman Beatty for a very thorough presentation and for pointing out that the Speaker, himself, and the Republican majority have indicated that they should be judged based on their capacity to complete the basics of their job responsibilities, which include the passage of a budget resolution. In fact, it was then- Congressman Ryan who, in 2012, stated that failing to enact a budget has serious consequences for American families. There are at least three current health crises that we are trying to deal with in America and throughout the world, but Republicans have abdicated their responsibility: the Zika virus, the Flint water crisis, and the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner cities, in suburban America, and all throughout the rural parts of this country; yet House Republicans have failed not just to put forth a budget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues, but they have chosen to simply ignore these crises in a manner that represents such a stunning departure of what responsible Members of Congress should be doing at this particular point in time. I am thankful that we have been joined by the distinguished gentlewoman from the great Lone Star State, who has always been thoughtful and eloquent on issues of importance not just to her district, which is anchored in Houston, Texas, but through her membership and leadership on the Homeland Security Committee as well as on the House Judiciary Committee. She has been so thoughtful and effective on a great many issues in the context of our safety, of our well-being, of criminal justice reform, of course, and of the protection of civil liberties--all issues that are fundamental to our democracy in the same way that a budgetary roadmap is fundamental to our democracy. Let me yield to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank my colleagues for their eloquence but, more importantly, for the Congressional Black Caucus in its taking up the mantle of the moral compass of justice. One would argue that justice is tied to our committee, the Judiciary Committee; but as I look at this Congress and as I look at a very small document called the Constitution, one can anchor the responsibilities of this body--of both the House and the Senate--Mr. Jeffries, in the Bill of Rights. I would like to just, very briefly, take us on a journey that indicates that our moral compass is broken because a budget that was supposed to be passed on April 15, by midnight, was not. To the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, let me thank her. She will have her own distinctive story, in her eloquence, about the fairness to the territories. I listened, as I came in, to the presentation by the gentlewoman from Ohio, who knows full well that we need a budget to ensure that there is full employment in America. Then I work extensively with my colleague on the Judiciary Committee, and we will not pass or fund prison reform without a budget. I rise today, however, to weave in and out of my comments about the moral compass that is broken to indicate that my district--the 18th Congressional District in Houston, Texas, and Harris County--is under a terrible emergency disaster. We are underwater. We are again facing an enormous rainfall that has been listed as historic and, possibly, as catastrophic. Let me acknowledge my mayor, Mayor Turner, and county judge, Judge Emmett, for the work that has been done so far; and let me indicate two pastors with whom I have just gotten off the phone, Bishop Dixon and Bishop Bady, who are watching hungry people come to a site, looking for food. {time} 2000 As I was speaking to the emergency leadership, they are indicating they were evacuating babies from apartments and people were being displaced. So what does that have to do with where we are today and no budget? Well, we know that the President introduced his budget a few months ago. Because of his responsibility, we know that Homeland Security was provided funding and FEMA was provided funding to deal with emergency declarations of a disaster. My district now needs it more than they have ever needed it. They need it in terms of providing for those immediate needs of vulnerable people without the resources to have stocked food, medical care, clothing, and also those who may be off work now because of the disaster. So we don't have a budget. We are not moving along to ensure that [[Page H1789]] FEMA, which has seen a lot of disasters over the last 2 years, has the necessary funding to do their job. That is a broken moral compass. It also reflects the Constitution because we are owed an equal treatment under the law and due process under the Fifth Amendment. There is no due process when I hear that one area is under water and we are not able to get help. Let me also say that, as I watch a broken moral system, I also look at the predicament that we will be in with the Zika virus. Congressman Jeffries has mentioned the opioid crisis, and we cannot forget the water crisis in Flint, but there is also the water crisis across the Nation. There is hard work that is being done by the Members in Michigan and Mr. Kildee. They need a budget to be able to fund the crisis or to help repair the crisis, restorative dollars, that a budget does to give a roadmap to the appropriators. I also know that we are facing another potential epidemic, if you will, the Zika virus that is taking control of places like Puerto Rico and other places in the Caribbean, places that we have not yet fully documented. I can assure you that the Gulf Coast States of Florida, Louisiana, and Texas are in the eye of the storm. The President a couple of months ago dutifully and responsibly introduced to this Congress a request of $1.9 billion--no, I didn't say trillions. I didn't say 5 billion. I said 1.9 billion--so that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can do their job. Mr. Jeffries, colleagues, if we are not doing our job, we need those who have the distinctive responsibility for issues of health and epidemics in this country to be able to do their job. We have now been told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it is not just in the prestages of pregnancy that the Zika virus can have a severe impact. It is throughout the pregnancy. We also know that they have just determined that it will be severe brain damage that will come about. So how irresponsible can it be to not put forward the emergency supplemental of $1.9 billion? I have sent letters to Secretary Burwell. I have sent letters to, obviously, the President of the United States in supporting his efforts. I have sent letters to our leader, Nancy Pelosi, who has been a champion on these issues of Zika funding. And I have sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan. Might I speak to the Speaker and certainly ask that a half-baked, if I might say, contribution to fighting the Zika virus is not going to work because any taking of monies from other places is going to damage the funding of malaria, tuberculosis, and a universal flu vaccine. Yes, it is going to undermine our needed and continued effort of fighting Ebola. Let me finish by simply saying this: Along with the idea of the Zika virus and other crises, when we hear headlines like this that indicate Americans still don't see a vibrant labor market, then you know what else is needed under this budget? We need a budget to be able to fully fund the retraining of Americans. I have introduced legislation that will train middle-age or middle- management workers and others and give them a stipend while they are being retrained for the 21st century jobs. We cannot do that with a budget not passed and an assessment not being made on how we would fund job training. Lastly, the Supreme Court heard a case today dealing with the issues of executive orders and immigration. I would argue that Texas and the other States do not have standing because they are not required to give driver's licenses or anything else, as the President provides a prioritization of who should be deported. I will say to you that, over the years, we have said over and over again to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which could have been a key element of a budget revenue to be able to help this country move along. Without a budget and an intelligent discussion about what comprehensive immigration reform would do as an added revenue for this country, here we are mumbling along while Houston remains under water, needing resources from FEMA, while the Zika virus is in distress with no monies and while a number of other important issues are not addressed. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jeffries for allowing me to spend a moment to at least tie in the Bill of Rights that deal with the very core values of this country. We have let down that basic document that guarantees equal protection, guarantees a certain freedom to be protected, guarantees that Americans have due process, if you will, and certainly guarantees the freedom of expression so that Americans can speak and be heard. They are speaking, but they are not being heard. What a shame that this budget has not been passed. I am grateful to the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me acknowledge the chairman and say: Let us keep our fight going because we have reason to provide that kind of comfort to the American people. Madam Speaker, Last week, House Republicans blew past the statutory deadline for Congress to enact a budget--reflecting apparently the belief of the Leadership that their already severe budget proposal was not radical enough to pass through a Republican Majority. The Do-Nothing Republican Congress is back. Instead of coming together with Democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hard-working American families, Republicans have decided not to pass a budget at all. The Republican-led Budget Committee, at the direction of the House GOP Leadership, put forward the most devastating `Road to Ruin' budget in history, but the Republican majority has rejected the plan as insufficiently severe. Here's what was too weak to satisfy the radical forces that have seized control of the Republican Party; a budget that would: 1. End the Medicare guarantee for seniors; 2. Make $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the House Budget Committee; 3. Devastate investments in good-paying jobs, education, and American infrastructure; 4. Repeal the Affordable Care Act and dismantle the affordable health care of 20 million Americans. Republicans have failed to keep their promise to pass a budget but their goal is still clear: to take us back to the radical trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle- class Americans. At the same time, House Republicans have done nothing to help the thousands of Americans struggling to protect their families from the three public health emergencies of the Zika virus, opioid addiction and the Flint Water Crisis: 1. As the House Democratic Leadership wrote to Speaker Ryan last month, these public health crises require swift and decisive Congressional action. 2. Also last week, Democrats on the Appropriations Committee wrote to Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY), requesting an immediate hearing on the Administration's $1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for Zika, pointing out that ``The Zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the potential to affect millions of Americans this summer, including more than two million pregnant women.'' 3. But House Republicans have responded with nothing but inaction and indifference. Instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public health crises, House Republicans are now wasting a full week grandstanding on the IRS. That's just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the American people have come to expect from the Do-Nothing Republican Congress. As NPR notes: Under Republican leadership, the 114th Congress has been ``short on meaty legislation and short on weeks in session . . . But there seems to be plenty of time to think about other things. Last month, one House member introduced a measure that would nationally recognized magic as an art form.'' Hard-working families deserve a Congress that invests in their future, protects safety, and creates a level-playing field for them and their children to succeed. Democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs and raises the paychecks of the American people, while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. Today, the Supreme -Court heard oral arguments in its review of the President's Immigration Executive Actions, which, as a result of congressional Republicans' inaction, address our Nation's broken immigration system and set important priorities in enforcing our immigration laws. The President's executive actions fall well within both the clear legal authority provided by Congress and the Constitution, and the [[Page H1790]] well-established precedents of immigration actions by every Democrat and Republican President for the last 50 years. 1. Six Republican presidents have used the same clear authority to make our immigration enforcement priorities better fit our values as a people and our needs as a nation; 2. Past presidents have routinely acted in the face of Congressional inaction; 3. Numerous noted legal scholars have found that the President's actions are well within his legal authority. The Immigration Executive Actions follow the same constitutional and legal precedent used by every Administration--Republican and Democratic--since President Eisenhower. Just as Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush did before him, President Obama took executive action to make our immigration system better meet the needs of our country and better reflect our values as Americans. As former Republican Senator Richard Lugar wrote in the New York Times: ``. . . whether or not you like President Obama's actions, he has operated under longstanding provisions of law that give the executive branch discretion in enforcement. This presidential prerogative has been recognized explicitly by the Supreme Court.'' Democrats stand for restoring sense to our utterly broken immigration system--so that we stop tearing apart families and separating parents from their children. Last month, House and Senate Democrats filed our own amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the President's Immigration Executive Actions. We are confident that the Supreme Court will affirm these vital immigration reforms and allow the President's steps to start fixing our immigration system to move forward. While Republicans stand with Donald Trump's incendiary anti-immigrant agenda, Democrats will continue to champion the comprehensive immigration reform our nation needs. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas. She raises several important points. One of the things that has struck me during my time here in Congress is that, under Republican reign, we have consistently seen government by crisis on one issue after the next. From the group of people that spend so much time messaging the point to the American people that they believe in fiscal responsibility, where is the fiscal responsibility in failing to put forth a budget consistent with the law that you supported? The other thing that amazes me--and the gentlewoman from Texas raised the point about the Supreme Court case that was argued earlier today on the immigration executive order issued by the President--I sit on the Judiciary Committee along with the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee and we hear almost every week about how lawless this President allegedly has been in terms of his time in office. Now, it is interesting to consistently hear the lectures about how lawless this President has allegedly been from people who believe that President Barack Obama exceeded his authority on January 20, 2009, the moment that he took the oath of office because there are folks who still cannot believe that this man is the President and leader of the free world. So I never buy that lawlessness argument. This is a group now that supports essentially undermining the Constitution over in the other house of this Congress. The President has done his job in putting forth the Supreme Court nominee, who is clearly qualified not according to Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but according to Orrin Hatch himself, one of the leading Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, amongst others. The lawlessness is not taking place at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is taking place right here in the United States Congress under the leadership of House and Senate Republicans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. JEFFRIES. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me just finish my point by saying that the reason why the budget is not here is because they could not muster the votes of the majority and they could not muster them even though their budget ended Medicare, it took $6.5 trillion in cuts from the overall budget, it devastated good-paying jobs, education, American infrastructure, and, again, it repealed the Affordable Care Act and dismantled the Affordable Care Act for 20 million people. Even with those poison pills to draw in support for some kind of budget that would fit within the law, their responsibility or the responsibility of Congress--they are in the majority--they could not pass or get on the floor a budget. Clearly, the moral compass is broken. More importantly, it denies equal protection under the law, in my interpretation, of millions of Americans depending on this Congress doing its job. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the thoughtful observations of the gentlewoman from Texas. I think we want to bring Representative Stacy Plaskett into this conversation in terms of the stunning inability to present a budget. As Representative Jackson Lee said, what else is there to do in terms of satisfying the extreme elements of your party? Privatize Social Security and throw older people out of their homes across the country? What else can you do? We are going to explore some of these draconian cuts that were in a budget that apparently is not extreme enough. I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), my good friend and colleague by way of Brooklyn, New York, I point out. We are so thankful for her presence here in the Congress. It is my honor now to yield to her. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jeffries and I thank the Congressional Black Caucus for giving us this opportunity to always be the conscience of this Congress. I want to thank the gentleman for his tireless efforts to raise awareness on not just the Committee on the Judiciary, but all of the work that he does. This group has come together this evening to talk about the fact that once again the Republicans have created a road to ruin in their budget failure. We talked about the fact that this Republican Congress has blown past the statutory deadline to enact a budget last week, reflecting, apparently, the belief of the leadership that their already severe budget proposal was not even radical enough to pass through this Republican majority. The gentleman talked about some of the draconian measures that were already in the budget that they had proposed, which seems to have not been sufficient enough for their caucus. At the direction of the House GOP leadership, the Budget Committee put forth one of the most devastating budgets in history and the majority rejected that plan as insufficient, which can only lead us to believe that it was not even severe enough for them. Some of the things that were in that budget were an end to a Medicare guarantee for seniors, makes $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the House Budget Committee--devastates investments in good-paying jobs, education, and American infrastructure, repeals the Affordable Care Act and dismantling the affordable health care of 20 million Americans. Now, as expressed by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), in February, the administration, our President, requested support for Americans through the budget that he submitted to this Congress, which provided support for education, job training support, bolstering our obligation to seniors, real tools for growth for the territories in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and others by inclusion in the Affordable Care Act and expansion of Medicare. But it seems that the Republicans have failed their promise to pass a budget, never mind even listen to or hear the head of OMB on that budget. Their goal is still clear, to take us back to radical, trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy in the past and hollowed out the wages of middle-class Americans. At that same time, House Republicans have done nothing to help the thousands of Americans struggling to protect their families from the three public health crises the chief spoke of: Zika, the opioid addict addictions, and the Flint water crisis. In Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and now even Texas, this is a real crisis concerns the Zika virus. Last week, Democrats on the Appropriations Committee wrote to Chairman Hal Rogers requesting an immediate hearing on the administration's [[Page H1791]] 1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for Zika, pointing out that: ``The Zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the potential to affect millions of Americans this summer, including more than 2 million pregnant women.'' What did that committee do? Absolutely nothing. Not even the respect of a hearing. They have not responded to anything but just their inaction and indifference. {time} 2015 Instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public health crises, the House Republicans are now wasting a full week grandstanding on the IRS. That is just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the American people have come to expect from this Congress. Hardworking families deserve a Congress that invests in their future, protects their safety, creates a level playing field for them and their children to succeed. Democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs, raises the paychecks, creates opportunities for American people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. I look forward to hearing, with the rest of my colleagues, their thoughts on this budget process and even possibly solutions for us as American people to come away with a clear budget that creates growth and opportunities for Americans. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Plaskett. She raised several important points. She noted that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to embrace this notion of trickle-down economics, which is sort of the foundation of many of the slash-and- burn cuts that are contained in at least a budget document that has been passed in prior years and the document that was put forth by the Committee on the Budget this year, this belief that if you lower the tax rate for millionaires and billionaires, that it will result in some residual benefit to the American people. But there is an irony in the embrace even of that term, ``trickle-down economics.'' With the leadership of Representative Bobby Scott and others, the CBC has consistently put forth a budget designed to open the floodgates of prosperity for working class Americans and middle class folks all throughout this country, but what the Republicans want to do is trickle-down economics. The only thing that you get with that philosophy, you may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay down. We are thankful that Representative Scott for so many years has consistently put forth through his leadership a budget from the Congressional Black Caucus designed to be both fiscally responsible and consistent with our ideals as a country that looks out for the least of those amongst us. Let me now yield to the distinguished representative from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mr. Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for getting the title of our State correct. I thank the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for yielding and organizing tonight's Special Order. Last week, the House of Representatives failed to pass a budget by the statutorily mandated date of April 15. This failure is unfortunate for our budget process, but perhaps not unfortunate for the American people because no budget is better than the proposed Republican budget that would have been brought to the floor. Our Nation's budget reflects priorities, but the Republican budget only highlights the wrong priorities. The budget the House Republicans wanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to students, working families, and seniors than their previous proposals. The Republican budget would end the Medicare guarantee for seniors by converting Medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation, shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens. The Republican budget would repeal the Affordable Care Act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of Americans, even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the Affordable Care Act to pay for the Affordable Care Act, all of those taxes remain in the budget. The Republican budget includes a total of $6.5 trillion in spending cuts, largely unspecified. If this level of cuts were ever made, it would devastate our investments and jobs, education, research, and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects. On top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking American families, the Republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires, and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral, suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy. But despite this, the Republican budget is not a credible plan. Are we really going to dismantle Medicare? Are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation? Are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy? I don't think so. But the House leadership couldn't even secure enough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their conference wanted even deeper, unrealistic spending cuts. Budgeting is about making tough choices, and the only choice the Republicans seem to have made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the budget on the backs of students, workers, seniors, the disabled, and vulnerable communities across the Nation while cutting taxes for the wealthy. The Congressional Black Caucus knows that is not the right choice. That is why, as we have done for the last 30 years, we have diligently prepared our own budget alternative to the Republican budget, which we would have offered as an amendment to the Republican budget if they had brought up their proposal. The CBC budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow our economy and ensure that every American family is able to prosper. Our budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program, totaling $500 billion over 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that it reaches virtually every community in America while also investing in what will guarantee America's long-term economic competitiveness. This jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs, school modernization, jobs for teachers and first responders, immediate investments in our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, assistance for neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis, job training programs, and summer jobs. Our budget calls for significant and sustained investments-- approximately $300 billion over the next decade--above the President's request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of Americans out of poverty. Some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, expanding access to affordable housing, increasing access to quality and affordable education, increasing funding for job training and Trade Adjustment Assistance, adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation, as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age. Thanks to the leadership of Congressman Jim Clyburn, our budget also ensures that Federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting Federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through the 10-20-30 formula. Our budget also includes more than $340 billion above the President's request for education over the next decade. This additional money will help make college more affordable by increasing the Pell grant, fully funding the President's free community college program, reducing interest rates on student loans, and financing other proposals to ensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable debt. The CBC budget also provides much-needed funding for families of Flint, Michigan, to help address the short-term and long-term cognitive and behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels. However, the [[Page H1792]] Congressional Black Caucus appreciates, unfortunately, that Flint is not the only community in America impacted by lead exposure. This is why our budget includes funds to help not only Flint, but also other communities across the Nation deal with the effects of lead exposure. Unlike the Republican budget, the CBC budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments. Our budget sets a new revenue target of $4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline. To demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic, our budget suggests several specific alternatives, totaling $7 trillion, that the House and Senate committees can choose from to reach that target. We ask for $4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least $7 trillion to choose from. We do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes, treating capital gains and dividends as regular income, a reasonable fee for financial transactions, restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago, specific items where you can choose from and, in fact, if we just cancel the Bush-era tax cuts, we would have almost $4 trillion in new revenue right there. At the end of the day, our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately $3.2 trillion over the next decade compared to the Congressional Budget Office's March 2016 baseline. The CBC budget chooses investments in America's children and workers, protects our most vulnerable communities, and changes the wrong choices offered by the Republican majority. I hope that we will have an opportunity to debate these issues if the House Republicans are ever able to bring their road-to-ruin budget to a full House vote. Again, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. Mr. JEFFRIES. Would the gentleman indulge one question? It was mentioned during that very thorough presentation of what is contained in the CBC budget the 10-20-30 program, and of course 10-20- 30, an initiative that has been championed by the CBC through the leadership of Representative Jim Clyburn, would put forth a formula where 10 percent of the funding allocation would go to counties where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 or more years. Is that correct? Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is correct. If you look at that, those counties and areas are spread all over the country, and if we are ever going to eradicate poverty, we have to target it to the high poverty areas, and 10-20-30 does exactly that. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentleman. In fact, what Representative Clyburn has consistently pointed out, which I think is important in an era where we are trying to find common ground and deal with the problems confronting the American people, if you look at a breakdown of persistently poor counties across the country and overlay that with congressional districts, a majority of those counties are actually represented by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This is something that we believe should be embraced by the Speaker and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as it would benefit, by the numbers, the constituents that they represent even more so than those of us within the CBC or on this side of the aisle. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. That is exactly true. I thank the gentleman very much for pointing that out. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scott. Let me now ask my colleague, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), to just react to some of what we have heard. One of the things that I thought was interesting in the presentation related to this budget is that if you look at the numbers, they are so extreme. I was on the Committee on the Budget during my first 2 years in Congress, but these numbers are even more extreme than what I remember in the 113th Congress. The budget apparently will cut $157 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over a 10- year period. The Republican budget that came out of the committee would cut roughly $2 trillion from Medicaid. When I was on the committee, the number was $700 million. I thought that was out of control, $700 million. Now we are at $2 trillion over a 10-year period apparently. And then we have got cuts in higher education. The proposal is $185 billion over 10 years. You have to ask the question: Why would anyone propose such draconian cuts? The answer is clear. This is not something that is often talked about, but the objective is to create a situation where you can dramatically lower the tax rates for the wealthiest amongst us. The top tax rate right now is 39.6 percent, but what the budget that has been put forth by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would do is that it would create two tax rates, one at 10 and the other at 25 percent. So what you will see is a tax cut that goes from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. The way that you balance a budget and pay for it is on the backs of working families, the middle class, senior citizens, children, the disabled, the poor, the afflicted, and everybody else who doesn't fall into the category of millionaire or billionaire. {time} 2030 Now, you wonder how it could be possible that anyone could think that they could get away with such a draconian budget. Well, again, the argument is trickle-down economics. But what I found fascinating--and maybe you could react to this, Representative Beatty--is that if you actually look at a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under President Clinton with a side- by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under George W. Bush, and then a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under President Obama, I think it is pretty clear who actually has been the responsible fiscal stewards. There were 20.3 million jobs created under the Clinton Presidency. America lost 650,000 jobs in 8 years under the Bush Presidency. America has now gained more than 14 million private sector jobs under 8 years of the Obama Presidency. What has been demonstrated is that the argument that if you lower tax rates, you create economic prosperity, is phony. Because Bill Clinton raised the top tax rate to 39.6 percent. It didn't seem to adversely impact the economy. In fact, it was humming between 1992 and 2000. George Bush comes to office, lowers the tax rate for high-income earners from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. We had the greatest recession in the history of modern America; the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. President Obama comes into office and he raises the top tax rate again from 35 to 39.6, more than 14 million jobs are created, the unemployment rate has dropped under his tenure from over 10 percent to 5 percent, the deficit has been reduced by more than a trillion dollars. The stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. Now it is up to 18,000. I haven't been in the 401(k) system as long as Congressman Scott, who clearly is monitoring the situation. So the prosperity numbers have been phenomenal. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for her reaction. Mrs. BEATTY. I think Mr. Jeffries and our other colleagues have said it so well, but here is what I am afraid of. I think the Republicans--the GOP--want to take us down to the radical trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle class, hardworking Americans. You said it all with that comparison from Clinton to Bush to now President Obama. And I could add to that long list: some 18 million people with health insurance; women having some of the best healthcare opportunities, getting mammograms for those who are under- and uninsured. We are able to have college students stay on their parent's insurance. So I think when we look at what is happening, there are billions of dollars that they want to do away with in programs. And we can add to that: the $185 billion from Federal college aid for low-income students or the $150 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Many of my constituents refer to that as their food stamps. And certainly, but for the Congressional Black Caucus, those members on the Agriculture Committee, those Members in leadership fighting for us to restore those dollars, I think it is quite simple. [[Page H1793]] I think what we are hearing tonight from our members of the Congressional Black Caucus is that they are trying to take us back in history. They are trying to take us back to an era of time, and we are not going to let them do that. We have too much at stake. We have gained so much. Someone may ask us tonight: Why are we here? Why are we the conscience of the Congress, Mr. Speaker? Why are we here tonight talking about the road to ruin and destruction by not having a congressional budget? I think the facts speak for themselves. I think that the American public needs to know that this is not something that just affects the Congressional Black Caucus. I want that to be clear. This affects America. You mentioned it with Mr. Clyburn's 10-20-30. The fact is more individuals who don't look like members of the Congressional Black Caucus will benefit. And that is the difference between Democrats and Republicans. We care about all people. They profess to have hearings on poverty, and then when you look at the results of their own budget and what they are doing to those individuals who live in poverty--chuckle we may, clear our voice, Mr. Speaker, as we may--the facts speak for themselves. They are not creating programs that will help us eliminate poverty. And it is as simple as that. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank you for laying that out. And I think history can be judged by objective observers as it relates to fiscal responsibility. But a few facts that perhaps some in the Chamber may have had amnesia about, but maybe it bears going through. Sequestration and painful budget cuts as it relates to the extreme agenda of some here in the Congress have been brought to us in a manner that has cost us both jobs and the ability to experience accelerated financial growth. We saw in the aftermath of a severe economic shock the approach that was taken by our friends over in Europe of extreme austerity did not bear financial fruit. It was the stimulus package that was put forth-- with not a single vote from anyone on the other side of the aisle--that was actually the financially responsible approach taken to help deal with the train wreck that President Obama inherited and to get the economy back on track. But, of course, the objective from the very beginning--not my words, but the words of the Senate majority leader on the other side of the Capitol--was to make the President a one-term President. I just don't even understand the philosophy of a President who takes office, inherits the worst economy since the Great Depression, and the number one agenda is to make sure that he is a one-term President. But that was an unsuccessful political endeavor. He gets a second term. The first thing that some of my good friends on the other side of the aisle decide to do, as we approach the end of the fiscal year in 2013, was to shut down the government for 16 days. It cost us $24 billion in lost economic productivity. That is not hyperbole. Those are facts. And what was it all for? Because there is this obsession--perhaps clinical in nature--with the Affordable Care Act. This is why we voted more than 50 times to destroy it, defeat it, delay it, and do everything possible to stop it. What could be possibly wrong with making sure that preexisting conditions don't prevent someone here in the greatest country in the history of the world from being able to get adequate medical care? What is wrong with more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans actually having health care? Yet, in the budget that apparently is not extreme enough, we would take away the Affordable Care Act. So these are just some of the facts. I wish we had some more time to explore it. That is not hyperbole. Historians will judge this Presidency and this Congress. I, of course, am of the belief that many will conclude that this is a Congress that has majored in obstruction, minored in dysfunction, and done everything possible to pursue a degree in legislative malpractice to the detriment of the American people. And I am hopeful that we can just get back on track and try to find common ground to do the business of the American people, which is why each and every one of us was sent here to the people's House. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Republican controlled House has once again missed a key deadline when it failed to pass a budget resolution before April 15. Despite promises to the contrary, House Speaker Paul Ryan has been unable to bring a budget resolution to the floor in a timely fashion. This is simply unacceptable. Completing a budget resolution is an important step in the budget process that will lay out Congress' spending priorities and create a unified vision for a more prosperous nation. While Democrats have endeavored to work cooperatively with Republicans to pass a comprehensive budget resolution, Speaker Ryan has insisted on pushing a budget that divides our country while further slashing critical investments aimed at strengthening our economy. The Republican budget reflects the needs of only a select few instead of the views and priorities of every American and places the burden of deficit reduction squarely on the backs of middle and working class Americans. It is clear that our most vulnerable segments of the population--the elderly, minorities, low-income earners, and others--have been most impacted by the Great Recession. Yet this latest Republican budget resolution continues to reflect the failed economic worldview that wealth will trickle down when we give massive tax breaks to the wealthy. Time and time again, history has demonstrated that this is simply untrue. It is unfortunate that the Republican-controlled Congress today is subjecting millions of hard-working families to even greater pressures to work longer hours for less pay, while we continue to prop up the wealthiest earners and biggest corporations with tax breaks and other loopholes. The Republican budget exemplifies these principles and drives the wedge deeper between the wealthy and our most vulnerable. Mr. Speaker, I believe our nation is on a dangerous path under this Republican leadership. Congress should be working to create jobs and increase pay for hard-working American families, not giving additional tax breaks to the wealthy and cutting spending for key social programs The Republicans have long abandoned their commitment to pass a budget resolution that reflects the needs of all Americans. Thus, I am strongly urging my colleagues to support fiscally sound and morally responsible budget alternatives that will create a level playing field and new opportunities for every American. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). The Chair would remind Members that remarks in debate may not engage in personalities toward the President, including by repeating remarks made elsewhere that would be improper if spoken in the Member's own words. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,52376,52376,52443,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [house] [pages h1787-h1793] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 congressional black caucus--road to ruin: house republicans fail on the budget the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from new york (mr. jeffries) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave mr. jeffries. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the subject of this special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? there was no objection. mr. jeffries. madam speaker, it is an honor and a privilege, once again, to come to the house floor on behalf of the congressional black caucus and join with my distinguished colleague from ohio, representative joyce beatty, as we anchor this congressional black caucus special order--the cbc hour of power--where, for 60 minutes, we get an opportunity to talk to the american people about issues of great importance to the african american community, to our democracy, and, certainly, to our country at large. today, we are here to discuss, tragically, the house gop's continued failure to demonstrate the ability to govern in a basic fashion--that is to pass a budget, which is required by statutory law, as of april 15. that deadline has come and gone, and we are still waiting for the house majority to present a budget to this body for our consideration. we were told for years by people, including by the current speaker of this great house, that the most fundamental tenet of governing is the passage of a budget. yet, even with republicans in firm control of both the house and the senate, it seems that this congress is still unable to get its act together. it is a stunning act of legislative abdication of basic responsibilities. we are going to explore that tonight, not just from a procedural standpoint, but from a standpoint of how this is indicative of this majority's unwillingness and inability to do the business of the american people. it is now my honor and my privilege to yield to my distinguished colleague, my coanchor, my classmate--the always eloquent and effervescent gentlewoman from the great city of columbus in the great state of ohio, representative joyce beatty. mrs. beatty. i thank the gentleman. i always look forward to engaging in our congressional black caucus' special order hour and, tonight, for our dialogue, for our debate, on the house republicans' repeated failure to pass a budget. first, let me say, as your classmate and colleague, being able to be the voice for your constituents and my constituents and america at large, it is an honor. i think it is so important, when we think about how important the work of this congress is, for us to take on challenging the house republicans' road to ruin. madam speaker, tonight, the congressional black caucus is going to discuss the importance of why we should pass a budget. not only that, i am sure mr. jeffries and i will have a dialogue about the value and the importance of having a budget. as members of congress and, especially, as members of the congressional black caucus, we know specifically that a budget creates jobs and that it raises the paychecks of hardworking american people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. madam speaker, let me just take a moment to point out that this is not [[page h1788]] the first time that the congressional black caucus has held a special order hour on the subject of the republicans' inaction. earlier this year, the congressional black caucus came to this house floor and implored the republican leadership to do its job--the job america wants us to do--and that was to enact commonsense gun control legislation. to date, madam speaker, republicans have continued to fail the american people by putting forth or by bringing forth commonsense gun control legislation. it is still hanging out there, waiting for action. now, again, here in the house of representatives, the people's house, we are faced with another instance of republican failure. under law, as spelled out in title iii of the congressional budget act, congress is directed to complete actions on the concurrent resolution on the budget by april 15, as we heard mr. jeffries remind us. a concurrent resolution on the budget means it is supposed to pass both the senate and the house, again, by april 15. at this date, neither chamber has considered a budget resolution for 2017. madam speaker, i don't know about your constituents, but in my district, ohio's third congressional district, my constituents expect congress to work; so let's take a look at it. what happens when people refuse to do their jobs? if postal workers don't deliver, you don't get your mail. if farmers don't farm, people don't eat. if teachers don't show up, our children don't learn. people all over america take their jobs seriously, and they expect us, as their elected officials, to also do that. it is time for house republicans to get america off the road to ruin and back on the path to prosperity. when speaker ryan took office--this is worth repeating, and congressman jeffries mentioned this earlier. when speaker ryan took office, house republicans stated that passing a budget was a basic function of government. however, the statutory deadline of passing a budget resolution by april 15 has come and gone, although house republicans made passing a budget a top priority for this year. in the republicans' own words, they can't even accomplish the basic functions of government--their job. madam speaker, why do we care that we don't have a budget? let me give you the answer. the importance of setting a budget is that it lays out the blueprint for the appropriations process. it outlines government spending for the year. without a budget, we have 12 appropriations bills that are working their way through congress without there being guiding principles on overall spending. if we cannot as a congress perform the basic functions of governing, how are we going to tackle the much more complicated issues, such as income inequality, education quality, tuition affordability, tax reform, and so many others? once again, house republicans have demonstrated the degree to which the sharp division within their conference is impeding congress' ability to work for the american people. instead of coming together with democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hardworking american families, they have just decided not to pass a budget. this decision was made despite the fact that president obama submitted his budget request to congress back in february. as you may remember, madam speaker, the republican majority here in the house of representatives and the republican-controlled senate took the unprecedented step of refusing to receive the omb director for a formal hearing so as to present the president's budget. madam speaker, how did that turn out for us? we all know how it turned out. the republican conference failed the american people, and it set us on a road to ruin by not passing a budget. mr. jeffries, i look forward to our continuing this dialogue tonight with other members of the congressional black caucus. mr. jeffries. i thank congresswoman beatty for a very thorough presentation and for pointing out that the speaker, himself, and the republican majority have indicated that they should be judged based on their capacity to complete the basics of their job responsibilities, which include the passage of a budget resolution. in fact, it was then- congressman ryan who, in 2012, stated that failing to enact a budget has serious consequences for american families. there are at least three current health crises that we are trying to deal with in america and throughout the world, but republicans have abdicated their responsibility: the zika virus, the flint water crisis, and the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner cities, in suburban america, and all throughout the rural parts of this country; yet house republicans have failed not just to put forth a budget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues, but they have chosen to simply ignore these crises in a manner that represents such a stunning departure of what responsible members of congress should be doing at this particular point in time. i am thankful that we have been joined by the distinguished gentlewoman from the great lone star state, who has always been thoughtful and eloquent on issues of importance not just to her district, which is anchored in houston, texas, but through her membership and leadership on the homeland security committee as well as on the house judiciary committee. she has been so thoughtful and effective on a great many issues in the context of our safety, of our well-being, of criminal justice reform, of course, and of the protection of civil liberties--all issues that are fundamental to our democracy in the same way that a budgetary roadmap is fundamental to our democracy. let me yield to representative sheila jackson lee. ms. jackson lee. i thank my colleagues for their eloquence but, more importantly, for the congressional black caucus in its taking up the mantle of the moral compass of justice. one would argue that justice is tied to our committee, the judiciary committee; but as i look at this congress and as i look at a very small document called the constitution, one can anchor the responsibilities of this body--of both the house and the senate--mr. jeffries, in the bill of rights. i would like to just, very briefly, take us on a journey that indicates that our moral compass is broken because a budget that was supposed to be passed on april 15, by midnight, was not. to the gentlewoman from the virgin islands, let me thank her. she will have her own distinctive story, in her eloquence, about the fairness to the territories. i listened, as i came in, to the presentation by the gentlewoman from ohio, who knows full well that we need a budget to ensure that there is full employment in america. then i work extensively with my colleague on the judiciary committee, and we will not pass or fund prison reform without a budget. i rise today, however, to weave in and out of my comments about the moral compass that is broken to indicate that my district--the 18th congressional district in houston, texas, and harris county--is under a terrible emergency disaster. we are underwater. we are again facing an enormous rainfall that has been listed as historic and, possibly, as catastrophic. let me acknowledge my mayor, mayor turner, and county judge, judge emmett, for the work that has been done so far; and let me indicate two pastors with whom i have just gotten off the phone, bishop dixon and bishop bady, who are watching hungry people come to a site, looking for food. {time} 2000 as i was speaking to the emergency leadership, they are indicating they were evacuating babies from apartments and people were being displaced. so what does that have to do with where we are today and no budget? well, we know that the president introduced his budget a few months ago. because of his responsibility, we know that homeland security was provided funding and fema was provided funding to deal with emergency declarations of a disaster. my district now needs it more than they have ever needed it. they need it in terms of providing for those immediate needs of vulnerable people without the resources to have stocked food, medical care, clothing, and also those who may be off work now because of the disaster. so we don't have a budget. we are not moving along to ensure that [[page h1789]] fema, which has seen a lot of disasters over the last 2 years, has the necessary funding to do their job. that is a broken moral compass. it also reflects the constitution because we are owed an equal treatment under the law and due process under the fifth amendment. there is no due process when i hear that one area is under water and we are not able to get help. let me also say that, as i watch a broken moral system, i also look at the predicament that we will be in with the zika virus. congressman jeffries has mentioned the opioid crisis, and we cannot forget the water crisis in flint, but there is also the water crisis across the nation. there is hard work that is being done by the members in michigan and mr. kildee. they need a budget to be able to fund the crisis or to help repair the crisis, restorative dollars, that a budget does to give a roadmap to the appropriators. i also know that we are facing another potential epidemic, if you will, the zika virus that is taking control of places like puerto rico and other places in the caribbean, places that we have not yet fully documented. i can assure you that the gulf coast states of florida, louisiana, and texas are in the eye of the storm. the president a couple of months ago dutifully and responsibly introduced to this congress a request of $1.9 billion--no, i didn't say trillions. i didn't say 5 billion. i said 1.9 billion--so that the centers for disease control and prevention can do their job. mr. jeffries, colleagues, if we are not doing our job, we need those who have the distinctive responsibility for issues of health and epidemics in this country to be able to do their job. we have now been told by the centers for disease control and prevention that it is not just in the prestages of pregnancy that the zika virus can have a severe impact. it is throughout the pregnancy. we also know that they have just determined that it will be severe brain damage that will come about. so how irresponsible can it be to not put forward the emergency supplemental of $1.9 billion? i have sent letters to secretary burwell. i have sent letters to, obviously, the president of the united states in supporting his efforts. i have sent letters to our leader, nancy pelosi, who has been a champion on these issues of zika funding. and i have sent a letter to speaker paul ryan. might i speak to the speaker and certainly ask that a half-baked, if i might say, contribution to fighting the zika virus is not going to work because any taking of monies from other places is going to damage the funding of malaria, tuberculosis, and a universal flu vaccine. yes, it is going to undermine our needed and continued effort of fighting ebola. let me finish by simply saying this: along with the idea of the zika virus and other crises, when we hear headlines like this that indicate americans still don't see a vibrant labor market, then you know what else is needed under this budget? we need a budget to be able to fully fund the retraining of americans. i have introduced legislation that will train middle-age or middle- management workers and others and give them a stipend while they are being retrained for the 21st century jobs. we cannot do that with a budget not passed and an assessment not being made on how we would fund job training. lastly, the supreme court heard a case today dealing with the issues of executive orders and immigration. i would argue that texas and the other states do not have standing because they are not required to give driver's licenses or anything else, as the president provides a prioritization of who should be deported. i will say to you that, over the years, we have said over and over again to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which could have been a key element of a budget revenue to be able to help this country move along. without a budget and an intelligent discussion about what comprehensive immigration reform would do as an added revenue for this country, here we are mumbling along while houston remains under water, needing resources from fema, while the zika virus is in distress with no monies and while a number of other important issues are not addressed. mr. speaker, i thank mr. jeffries for allowing me to spend a moment to at least tie in the bill of rights that deal with the very core values of this country. we have let down that basic document that guarantees equal protection, guarantees a certain freedom to be protected, guarantees that americans have due process, if you will, and certainly guarantees the freedom of expression so that americans can speak and be heard. they are speaking, but they are not being heard. what a shame that this budget has not been passed. i am grateful to the congressional black caucus. let me acknowledge the chairman and say: let us keep our fight going because we have reason to provide that kind of comfort to the american people. madam speaker, last week, house republicans blew past the statutory deadline for congress to enact a budget--reflecting apparently the belief of the leadership that their already severe budget proposal was not radical enough to pass through a republican majority. the do-nothing republican congress is back. instead of coming together with democrats to pass a budget resolution that will create jobs and grow the paychecks of hard-working american families, republicans have decided not to pass a budget at all. the republican-led budget committee, at the direction of the house gop leadership, put forward the most devastating `road to ruin' budget in history, but the republican majority has rejected the plan as insufficiently severe. here's what was too weak to satisfy the radical forces that have seized control of the republican party; a budget that would: 1. end the medicare guarantee for seniors; 2. make $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the house budget committee; 3. devastate investments in good-paying jobs, education, and american infrastructure; 4. repeal the affordable care act and dismantle the affordable health care of 20 million americans. republicans have failed to keep their promise to pass a budget but their goal is still clear: to take us back to the radical trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle- class americans. at the same time, house republicans have done nothing to help the thousands of americans struggling to protect their families from the three public health emergencies of the zika virus, opioid addiction and the flint water crisis: 1. as the house democratic leadership wrote to speaker ryan last month, these public health crises require swift and decisive congressional action. 2. also last week, democrats on the appropriations committee wrote to chairman hal rogers (r-ky), requesting an immediate hearing on the administration's $1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for zika, pointing out that ``the zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the potential to affect millions of americans this summer, including more than two million pregnant women.'' 3. but house republicans have responded with nothing but inaction and indifference. instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public health crises, house republicans are now wasting a full week grandstanding on the irs. that's just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the american people have come to expect from the do-nothing republican congress. as npr notes: under republican leadership, the 114th congress has been ``short on meaty legislation and short on weeks in session . . . but there seems to be plenty of time to think about other things. last month, one house member introduced a measure that would nationally recognized magic as an art form.'' hard-working families deserve a congress that invests in their future, protects safety, and creates a level-playing field for them and their children to succeed. democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs and raises the paychecks of the american people, while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. today, the supreme -court heard oral arguments in its review of the president's immigration executive actions, which, as a result of congressional republicans' inaction, address our nation's broken immigration system and set important priorities in enforcing our immigration laws. the president's executive actions fall well within both the clear legal authority provided by congress and the constitution, and the [[page h1790]] well-established precedents of immigration actions by every democrat and republican president for the last 50 years. 1. six republican presidents have used the same clear authority to make our immigration enforcement priorities better fit our values as a people and our needs as a nation; 2. past presidents have routinely acted in the face of congressional inaction; 3. numerous noted legal scholars have found that the president's actions are well within his legal authority. the immigration executive actions follow the same constitutional and legal precedent used by every administration--republican and democratic--since president eisenhower. just as presidents ronald reagan and george h.w. bush did before him, president obama took executive action to make our immigration system better meet the needs of our country and better reflect our values as americans. as former republican senator richard lugar wrote in the new york times: ``. . . whether or not you like president obama's actions, he has operated under longstanding provisions of law that give the executive branch discretion in enforcement. this presidential prerogative has been recognized explicitly by the supreme court.'' democrats stand for restoring sense to our utterly broken immigration system--so that we stop tearing apart families and separating parents from their children. last month, house and senate democrats filed our own amicus brief with the supreme court in support of the president's immigration executive actions. we are confident that the supreme court will affirm these vital immigration reforms and allow the president's steps to start fixing our immigration system to move forward. while republicans stand with donald trump's incendiary anti-immigrant agenda, democrats will continue to champion the comprehensive immigration reform our nation needs. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i thank the distinguished gentlewoman from texas. she raises several important points. one of the things that has struck me during my time here in congress is that, under republican reign, we have consistently seen government by crisis on one issue after the next. from the group of people that spend so much time messaging the point to the american people that they believe in fiscal responsibility, where is the fiscal responsibility in failing to put forth a budget consistent with the law that you supported? the other thing that amazes me--and the gentlewoman from texas raised the point about the supreme court case that was argued earlier today on the immigration executive order issued by the president--i sit on the judiciary committee along with the honorable sheila jackson lee and we hear almost every week about how lawless this president allegedly has been in terms of his time in office. now, it is interesting to consistently hear the lectures about how lawless this president has allegedly been from people who believe that president barack obama exceeded his authority on january 20, 2009, the moment that he took the oath of office because there are folks who still cannot believe that this man is the president and leader of the free world. so i never buy that lawlessness argument. this is a group now that supports essentially undermining the constitution over in the other house of this congress. the president has done his job in putting forth the supreme court nominee, who is clearly qualified not according to members of the congressional black caucus, but according to orrin hatch himself, one of the leading members of the senate judiciary committee, amongst others. the lawlessness is not taking place at 1600 pennsylvania avenue. it is taking place right here in the united states congress under the leadership of house and senate republicans. ms. jackson lee. will the gentleman yield? mr. jeffries. i yield to the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, let me just finish my point by saying that the reason why the budget is not here is because they could not muster the votes of the majority and they could not muster them even though their budget ended medicare, it took $6.5 trillion in cuts from the overall budget, it devastated good-paying jobs, education, american infrastructure, and, again, it repealed the affordable care act and dismantled the affordable care act for 20 million people. even with those poison pills to draw in support for some kind of budget that would fit within the law, their responsibility or the responsibility of congress--they are in the majority--they could not pass or get on the floor a budget. clearly, the moral compass is broken. more importantly, it denies equal protection under the law, in my interpretation, of millions of americans depending on this congress doing its job. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i appreciate the thoughtful observations of the gentlewoman from texas. i think we want to bring representative stacy plaskett into this conversation in terms of the stunning inability to present a budget. as representative jackson lee said, what else is there to do in terms of satisfying the extreme elements of your party? privatize social security and throw older people out of their homes across the country? what else can you do? we are going to explore some of these draconian cuts that were in a budget that apparently is not extreme enough. i yield to the gentlewoman from the virgin islands (ms. plaskett), my good friend and colleague by way of brooklyn, new york, i point out. we are so thankful for her presence here in the congress. it is my honor now to yield to her. ms. plaskett. mr. speaker, i thank congressman jeffries and i thank the congressional black caucus for giving us this opportunity to always be the conscience of this congress. i want to thank the gentleman for his tireless efforts to raise awareness on not just the committee on the judiciary, but all of the work that he does. this group has come together this evening to talk about the fact that once again the republicans have created a road to ruin in their budget failure. we talked about the fact that this republican congress has blown past the statutory deadline to enact a budget last week, reflecting, apparently, the belief of the leadership that their already severe budget proposal was not even radical enough to pass through this republican majority. the gentleman talked about some of the draconian measures that were already in the budget that they had proposed, which seems to have not been sufficient enough for their caucus. at the direction of the house gop leadership, the budget committee put forth one of the most devastating budgets in history and the majority rejected that plan as insufficient, which can only lead us to believe that it was not even severe enough for them. some of the things that were in that budget were an end to a medicare guarantee for seniors, makes $6.5 trillion in cuts--the sharpest cuts ever proposed by the house budget committee--devastates investments in good-paying jobs, education, and american infrastructure, repeals the affordable care act and dismantling the affordable health care of 20 million americans. now, as expressed by the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty), in february, the administration, our president, requested support for americans through the budget that he submitted to this congress, which provided support for education, job training support, bolstering our obligation to seniors, real tools for growth for the territories in puerto rico, the virgin islands, and others by inclusion in the affordable care act and expansion of medicare. but it seems that the republicans have failed their promise to pass a budget, never mind even listen to or hear the head of omb on that budget. their goal is still clear, to take us back to radical, trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy in the past and hollowed out the wages of middle-class americans. at that same time, house republicans have done nothing to help the thousands of americans struggling to protect their families from the three public health crises the chief spoke of: zika, the opioid addict addictions, and the flint water crisis. in virgin islands, puerto rico, florida, and now even texas, this is a real crisis concerns the zika virus. last week, democrats on the appropriations committee wrote to chairman hal rogers requesting an immediate hearing on the administration's [[page h1791]] 1.9 billion emergency supplemental request for zika, pointing out that: ``the zika virus is a true public health emergency that has the potential to affect millions of americans this summer, including more than 2 million pregnant women.'' what did that committee do? absolutely nothing. not even the respect of a hearing. they have not responded to anything but just their inaction and indifference. {time} 2015 instead of taking action to pass a budget or address urgent public health crises, the house republicans are now wasting a full week grandstanding on the irs. that is just the kind of hollow, meaningless posturing the american people have come to expect from this congress. hardworking families deserve a congress that invests in their future, protects their safety, creates a level playing field for them and their children to succeed. democrats will continue to press for a budget that creates jobs, raises the paychecks, creates opportunities for american people while reducing the deficit in a balanced and responsible way. i look forward to hearing, with the rest of my colleagues, their thoughts on this budget process and even possibly solutions for us as american people to come away with a clear budget that creates growth and opportunities for americans. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i thank representative plaskett. she raised several important points. she noted that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to embrace this notion of trickle-down economics, which is sort of the foundation of many of the slash-and- burn cuts that are contained in at least a budget document that has been passed in prior years and the document that was put forth by the committee on the budget this year, this belief that if you lower the tax rate for millionaires and billionaires, that it will result in some residual benefit to the american people. but there is an irony in the embrace even of that term, ``trickle-down economics.'' with the leadership of representative bobby scott and others, the cbc has consistently put forth a budget designed to open the floodgates of prosperity for working class americans and middle class folks all throughout this country, but what the republicans want to do is trickle-down economics. the only thing that you get with that philosophy, you may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay down. we are thankful that representative scott for so many years has consistently put forth through his leadership a budget from the congressional black caucus designed to be both fiscally responsible and consistent with our ideals as a country that looks out for the least of those amongst us. let me now yield to the distinguished representative from the commonwealth of virginia, mr. bobby scott. mr. scott of virginia. madam speaker, i thank the gentleman for getting the title of our state correct. i thank the gentleman from new york and the gentlewoman from ohio for yielding and organizing tonight's special order. last week, the house of representatives failed to pass a budget by the statutorily mandated date of april 15. this failure is unfortunate for our budget process, but perhaps not unfortunate for the american people because no budget is better than the proposed republican budget that would have been brought to the floor. our nation's budget reflects priorities, but the republican budget only highlights the wrong priorities. the budget the house republicans wanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to students, working families, and seniors than their previous proposals. the republican budget would end the medicare guarantee for seniors by converting medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation, shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens. the republican budget would repeal the affordable care act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of americans, even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the affordable care act to pay for the affordable care act, all of those taxes remain in the budget. the republican budget includes a total of $6.5 trillion in spending cuts, largely unspecified. if this level of cuts were ever made, it would devastate our investments and jobs, education, research, and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects. on top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking american families, the republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires, and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral, suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy. but despite this, the republican budget is not a credible plan. are we really going to dismantle medicare? are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation? are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy? i don't think so. but the house leadership couldn't even secure enough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their conference wanted even deeper, unrealistic spending cuts. budgeting is about making tough choices, and the only choice the republicans seem to have made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the budget on the backs of students, workers, seniors, the disabled, and vulnerable communities across the nation while cutting taxes for the wealthy. the congressional black caucus knows that is not the right choice. that is why, as we have done for the last 30 years, we have diligently prepared our own budget alternative to the republican budget, which we would have offered as an amendment to the republican budget if they had brought up their proposal. the cbc budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow our economy and ensure that every american family is able to prosper. our budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program, totaling $500 billion over 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that it reaches virtually every community in america while also investing in what will guarantee america's long-term economic competitiveness. this jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs, school modernization, jobs for teachers and first responders, immediate investments in our nation's crumbling infrastructure, assistance for neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis, job training programs, and summer jobs. our budget calls for significant and sustained investments-- approximately $300 billion over the next decade--above the president's request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of americans out of poverty. some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the supplemental nutrition assistance program, expanding access to affordable housing, increasing access to quality and affordable education, increasing funding for job training and trade adjustment assistance, adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation, as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age. thanks to the leadership of congressman jim clyburn, our budget also ensures that federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through the 10-20-30 formula. our budget also includes more than $340 billion above the president's request for education over the next decade. this additional money will help make college more affordable by increasing the pell grant, fully funding the president's free community college program, reducing interest rates on student loans, and financing other proposals to ensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable debt. the cbc budget also provides much-needed funding for families of flint, michigan, to help address the short-term and long-term cognitive and behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels. however, the [[page h1792]] congressional black caucus appreciates, unfortunately, that flint is not the only community in america impacted by lead exposure. this is why our budget includes funds to help not only flint, but also other communities across the nation deal with the effects of lead exposure. unlike the republican budget, the cbc budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments. our budget sets a new revenue target of $4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline. to demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic, our budget suggests several specific alternatives, totaling $7 trillion, that the house and senate committees can choose from to reach that target. we ask for $4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least $7 trillion to choose from. we do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes, treating capital gains and dividends as regular income, a reasonable fee for financial transactions, restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago, specific items where you can choose from and, in fact, if we just cancel the bush-era tax cuts, we would have almost $4 trillion in new revenue right there. at the end of the day, our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately $3.2 trillion over the next decade compared to the congressional budget office's march 2016 baseline. the cbc budget chooses investments in america's children and workers, protects our most vulnerable communities, and changes the wrong choices offered by the republican majority. i hope that we will have an opportunity to debate these issues if the house republicans are ever able to bring their road-to-ruin budget to a full house vote. again, i thank the gentleman from new york for yielding. mr. jeffries. would the gentleman indulge one question? it was mentioned during that very thorough presentation of what is contained in the cbc budget the 10-20-30 program, and of course 10-20- 30, an initiative that has been championed by the cbc through the leadership of representative jim clyburn, would put forth a formula where 10 percent of the funding allocation would go to counties where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 or more years. is that correct? mr. scott of virginia. that is correct. if you look at that, those counties and areas are spread all over the country, and if we are ever going to eradicate poverty, we have to target it to the high poverty areas, and 10-20-30 does exactly that. mr. jeffries. i thank the distinguished gentleman. in fact, what representative clyburn has consistently pointed out, which i think is important in an era where we are trying to find common ground and deal with the problems confronting the american people, if you look at a breakdown of persistently poor counties across the country and overlay that with congressional districts, a majority of those counties are actually represented by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. this is something that we believe should be embraced by the speaker and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as it would benefit, by the numbers, the constituents that they represent even more so than those of us within the cbc or on this side of the aisle. mr. scott of virginia. that is exactly true. i thank the gentleman very much for pointing that out. mr. jeffries. mr. speaker, i thank representative scott. let me now ask my colleague, the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty), to just react to some of what we have heard. one of the things that i thought was interesting in the presentation related to this budget is that if you look at the numbers, they are so extreme. i was on the committee on the budget during my first 2 years in congress, but these numbers are even more extreme than what i remember in the 113th congress. the budget apparently will cut $157 billion from the supplemental nutrition assistance program over a 10- year period. the republican budget that came out of the committee would cut roughly $2 trillion from medicaid. when i was on the committee, the number was $700 million. i thought that was out of control, $700 million. now we are at $2 trillion over a 10-year period apparently. and then we have got cuts in higher education. the proposal is $185 billion over 10 years. you have to ask the question: why would anyone propose such draconian cuts? the answer is clear. this is not something that is often talked about, but the objective is to create a situation where you can dramatically lower the tax rates for the wealthiest amongst us. the top tax rate right now is 39.6 percent, but what the budget that has been put forth by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would do is that it would create two tax rates, one at 10 and the other at 25 percent. so what you will see is a tax cut that goes from 39.6 percent to 25 percent. the way that you balance a budget and pay for it is on the backs of working families, the middle class, senior citizens, children, the disabled, the poor, the afflicted, and everybody else who doesn't fall into the category of millionaire or billionaire. {time} 2030 now, you wonder how it could be possible that anyone could think that they could get away with such a draconian budget. well, again, the argument is trickle-down economics. but what i found fascinating--and maybe you could react to this, representative beatty--is that if you actually look at a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under president clinton with a side- by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under george w. bush, and then a side-by-side comparison of the economy 8 years under president obama, i think it is pretty clear who actually has been the responsible fiscal stewards. there were 20.3 million jobs created under the clinton presidency. america lost 650,000 jobs in 8 years under the bush presidency. america has now gained more than 14 million private sector jobs under 8 years of the obama presidency. what has been demonstrated is that the argument that if you lower tax rates, you create economic prosperity, is phony. because bill clinton raised the top tax rate to 39.6 percent. it didn't seem to adversely impact the economy. in fact, it was humming between 1992 and 2000. george bush comes to office, lowers the tax rate for high-income earners from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. we had the greatest recession in the history of modern america; the worst financial crisis since the great depression. president obama comes into office and he raises the top tax rate again from 35 to 39.6, more than 14 million jobs are created, the unemployment rate has dropped under his tenure from over 10 percent to 5 percent, the deficit has been reduced by more than a trillion dollars. the stock market has gone from 6,000 to over 16,000. now it is up to 18,000. i haven't been in the 401(k) system as long as congressman scott, who clearly is monitoring the situation. so the prosperity numbers have been phenomenal. i yield to the gentlewoman from ohio (mrs. beatty) for her reaction. mrs. beatty. i think mr. jeffries and our other colleagues have said it so well, but here is what i am afraid of. i think the republicans--the gop--want to take us down to the radical trickle-down agenda that shattered our economy and hollowed out the wages of middle class, hardworking americans. you said it all with that comparison from clinton to bush to now president obama. and i could add to that long list: some 18 million people with health insurance; women having some of the best healthcare opportunities, getting mammograms for those who are under- and uninsured. we are able to have college students stay on their parent's insurance. so i think when we look at what is happening, there are billions of dollars that they want to do away with in programs. and we can add to that: the $185 billion from federal college aid for low-income students or the $150 billion from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, or snap. many of my constituents refer to that as their food stamps. and certainly, but for the congressional black caucus, those members on the agriculture committee, those members in leadership fighting for us to restore those dollars, i think it is quite simple. [[page h1793]] i think what we are hearing tonight from our members of the congressional black caucus is that they are trying to take us back in history. they are trying to take us back to an era of time, and we are not going to let them do that. we have too much at stake. we have gained so much. someone may ask us tonight: why are we here? why are we the conscience of the congress, mr. speaker? why are we here tonight talking about the road to ruin and destruction by not having a congressional budget? i think the facts speak for themselves. i think that the american public needs to know that this is not something that just affects the congressional black caucus. i want that to be clear. this affects america. you mentioned it with mr. clyburn's 10-20-30. the fact is more individuals who don't look like members of the congressional black caucus will benefit. and that is the difference between democrats and republicans. we care about all people. they profess to have hearings on poverty, and then when you look at the results of their own budget and what they are doing to those individuals who live in poverty--chuckle we may, clear our voice, mr. speaker, as we may--the facts speak for themselves. they are not creating programs that will help us eliminate poverty. and it is as simple as that. mr. jeffries. i thank you for laying that out. and i think history can be judged by objective observers as it relates to fiscal responsibility. but a few facts that perhaps some in the chamber may have had amnesia about, but maybe it bears going through. sequestration and painful budget cuts as it relates to the extreme agenda of some here in the congress have been brought to us in a manner that has cost us both jobs and the ability to experience accelerated financial growth. we saw in the aftermath of a severe economic shock the approach that was taken by our friends over in europe of extreme austerity did not bear financial fruit. it was the stimulus package that was put forth-- with not a single vote from anyone on the other side of the aisle--that was actually the financially responsible approach taken to help deal with the train wreck that president obama inherited and to get the economy back on track. but, of course, the objective from the very beginning--not my words, but the words of the senate majority leader on the other side of the capitol--was to make the president a one-term president. i just don't even understand the philosophy of a president who takes office, inherits the worst economy since the great depression, and the number one agenda is to make sure that he is a one-term president. but that was an unsuccessful political endeavor. he gets a second term. the first thing that some of my good friends on the other side of the aisle decide to do, as we approach the end of the fiscal year in 2013, was to shut down the government for 16 days. it cost us $24 billion in lost economic productivity. that is not hyperbole. those are facts. and what was it all for? because there is this obsession--perhaps clinical in nature--with the affordable care act. this is why we voted more than 50 times to destroy it, defeat it, delay it, and do everything possible to stop it. what could be possibly wrong with making sure that preexisting conditions don't prevent someone here in the greatest country in the history of the world from being able to get adequate medical care? what is wrong with more than 20 million previously uninsured americans actually having health care? yet, in the budget that apparently is not extreme enough, we would take away the affordable care act. so these are just some of the facts. i wish we had some more time to explore it. that is not hyperbole. historians will judge this presidency and this congress. i, of course, am of the belief that many will conclude that this is a congress that has majored in obstruction, minored in dysfunction, and done everything possible to pursue a degree in legislative malpractice to the detriment of the american people. and i am hopeful that we can just get back on track and try to find common ground to do the business of the american people, which is why each and every one of us was sent here to the people's house. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, the republican controlled house has once again missed a key deadline when it failed to pass a budget resolution before april 15. despite promises to the contrary, house speaker paul ryan has been unable to bring a budget resolution to the floor in a timely fashion. this is simply unacceptable. completing a budget resolution is an important step in the budget process that will lay out congress' spending priorities and create a unified vision for a more prosperous nation. while democrats have endeavored to work cooperatively with republicans to pass a comprehensive budget resolution, speaker ryan has insisted on pushing a budget that divides our country while further slashing critical investments aimed at strengthening our economy. the republican budget reflects the needs of only a select few instead of the views and priorities of every american and places the burden of deficit reduction squarely on the backs of middle and working class americans. it is clear that our most vulnerable segments of the population--the elderly, minorities, low-income earners, and others--have been most impacted by the great recession. yet this latest republican budget resolution continues to reflect the failed economic worldview that wealth will trickle down when we give massive tax breaks to the wealthy. time and time again, history has demonstrated that this is simply untrue. it is unfortunate that the republican-controlled congress today is subjecting millions of hard-working families to even greater pressures to work longer hours for less pay, while we continue to prop up the wealthiest earners and biggest corporations with tax breaks and other loopholes. the republican budget exemplifies these principles and drives the wedge deeper between the wealthy and our most vulnerable. mr. speaker, i believe our nation is on a dangerous path under this republican leadership. congress should be working to create jobs and increase pay for hard-working american families, not giving additional tax breaks to the wealthy and cutting spending for key social programs the republicans have long abandoned their commitment to pass a budget resolution that reflects the needs of all americans. thus, i am strongly urging my colleagues to support fiscally sound and morally responsible budget alternatives that will create a level playing field and new opportunities for every american. the speaker pro tempore (mr. loudermilk). the chair would remind members that remarks in debate may not engage in personalities toward the president, including by repeating remarks made elsewhere that would be improper if spoken in the member's own words. ____________________",52376
CREC-2016-04-18-pt1-PgH1793,CREC-2016-04-18,114,RESTORING ARTICLE I CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO CONGRESS,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1793-H1797] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESTORING ARTICLE I CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for 30 minutes. General Leave Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on this evening's Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, if Congress does not assert its constitutional authority, we risk becoming obsolete in the eyes of an Executive that would prefer to legislate with a phone and a pen as a replacement for this body. Thank you to all my colleagues who join me this evening, and may God bless America. Every day, before Members of Congress meet to conduct official business, we gather to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States of America. We place our right hand over our hearts and promise to our colleagues, our constituents, and all Americans that we will uphold the rule of law. This very law is the very vehicle that has ensured liberty and justice for all even being a possibility: the rule of law. Unfortunately, this administration seems intent on operating outside the rule of law. It insists upon circumventing Congress by changing laws and legislating from the Oval Office, not from Capitol Hill. Time and again, the American people have had to bear witness to the blatant disrespect this administration has for [[Page H1794]] our Constitution. In my heart, I believe this disrespect is on full display in the embattled fight Congress and the American people find themselves in today with the executive branch at the Supreme Court. This morning, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the United States v. Texas case, including 25 other States. To some, this case is simply an argument over whether or not you are pro-illegal immigration. Let me repeat that. You are pro-illegal immigration or not. To others, this case is about keeping families together. To many, like myself, it is about protecting the dignity of our Constitution and the balance of powers within the three branches of government. The United States v. Texas is about the rule of law and defending the integrity of our great institution of government. We are a constitutional Republic. And yet, the President's mass deferred action on deportation of individuals residing within our country illegally would make it seem more like we are living in a dictatorship. The Constitution is clear on the issues of legislation. Article I, section 1 explicitly states: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.'' Let that sink in for a moment. ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.'' Article I, section 8, clause 4: ``to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' That is solely the responsibility of this body. Take notice of the absence of any reference to the executive office, executive branch, or judicial branch. Article II, section 3, however, states that the President ``shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' It is referred to as the Take Care Clause. That the laws be faithfully executed, not established, not rewritten, not selectively enforce portions of law, but to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. {time} 2045 That power is still delegated to Congress just as it was over two centuries ago. If the Supreme Court upholds the administrative executive action, I fear that our Republic--that is the United States--will die. We will see an end of a Nation that started by fending off tyranny. We will see the end of a Nation which has withstood a civil war, two world wars, and countless terrorist attacks. Terrorists hate the United States simply because of the manner through which we have prospered under the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. Again, the success of our Nation is because we are a land and a Nation of laws. I urge all of my colleagues in the House and the Senate to not falter in their defense of the founding principles upon which this great Nation was built. Interesting, today, at the Supreme Court, I was there to speak on these very topics. Many pro-illegal immigrants were present, and I found it very interesting they were shouting, demonstrating, exercising freedom of speech, freedom of speech and demonstrating in America, simply because we have a Constitution that protects that. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brat), my good friend and colleague. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss the case being heard before the Supreme Court, United States v. Texas, and the President's unconstitutional executive actions on immigration and the need for the restoration of the balance of powers between the branches of government. This case is the challenge to President Obama's executive actions for illegal immigrants, the so-called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, otherwise known as DAPA, an expansion of the earlier Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, otherwise known as DACA. The lawsuit was brought by Governors and attorneys general from the Texas Supreme Court and 25 other States. That is significant, in and of itself. Under these unconstitutional programs, President Obama claims the right to, by executive fiat, make an illegal immigrant ``lawfully present.'' Let me say that again real slow. The President claims, by right, by executive fiat, to make an illegal immigrant ``lawfully present'' in the United States and eligible to receive a work permit after an application is reviewed and a fee is paid. This is straight out of ``1984.'' The language is upside down. The government is handing out work permits and making illegal immigrants eligible to work in the United States as well as receive Social Security, unemployment, and disability benefits. But this only hurts American citizens and taxpayers. What has Congress done about this? Not enough. The real issue in this case is not discretion, but whether or not there is any limit at all on Presidential power. The Founders recognized these distinctions, and they made Congress the first branch among equals of the Federal Government and the most accountable branch to the American people--and thus, Article I, not II. The Congress is Article I. The Founders created a system of checks and balances to ensure no individual could gain absolute power within the government without a check, not even George Washington, whom they all loved. Under our Constitution, the Congress is entrusted with ``all legislative powers''--all, including the power ``to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' The Founders drafted the Constitution to clearly state that it is not the President who writes the laws; Congress does. Much of the President's job is to faithfully execute these laws passed by Congress. In fact, neither any immigration law nor the Constitution empowers the Executive to authorize, let alone facilitate, the violation of the laws passed by Congress. The President even acknowledged this 22 times on TV before using his pen and phone to act alone without Congress. This imbalance of powers is a threat to self-government itself. Our inaction, time and again, has expanded the administrative state and left the American people without a voice in Washington. The Presidential elections on both sides of the aisle are making this abundantly clear. For starters, we can advocate for reforms in four principled areas: reclaiming Congress' power of the purse, reforming executive-empowering legislative ``cliffs,'' restoring congressional authority over regulations and regulators, and reining in executive discretion. I have sponsored simple legislation to do just that: return power back to Congress. I introduced a bill to reform this process with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, the primary agency for implementing the President's immigration executive order. USCIS funds itself through application fees, which insulates it from the will of the American people as expressed through their Representatives in Congress. Congress cannot effectively exercise its powers through the appropriations process to perform basic oversight functions and ensure the agency is executing the laws faithfully. My proposal, the Use Spending for Congressional Immigration Supervision, USCIS, Act, will make unaccountable agencies like the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services accountable to Congress and, therefore, accountable to the American people. Putting USCIS on appropriations ensures that unelected bureaucrats are held accountable and provides transparency for how the Federal Government is raising and spending your money. Congress needs to reassert its power of the purse by making agency budgets subject to appropriations, but we cannot stop there. There is more Congress has to do to restore Congress' power to hold the executive branch accountable. The Constitution still gives Congress all its powers. It is up to Congress to step up and start using them. Mr. YOHO. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King). Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Florida for organizing this Special Order, for his leadership, for his constitutional convictions, and for the opportunity to address you tonight, Mr. Speaker, here on the floor of the House of Representatives. [[Page H1795]] I am listening to this dialogue that is taking place here on the floor, and this thought occurred to me that, several years ago, our borders are so open and our borders are so porous, and we have a President who has refused to enforce the law. In fact, he sends the message through his executive branch, if you are determined to enforce the law and you are a member of the Border Patrol, you had better find another job. I mean, that came out of the President and his leadership team all the way on down to our Border Patrol agents. I have been down to the border a good number of times, and I have watched as people come across the border in broad daylight, float across there in a raft. They get unloaded, stand there on the grass on our side of the river, and wait for the Border Patrol to come down with a welcome wagon and say: Would you like to apply for asylum? And, by the way, one of them was a pregnant lady, and so I am sure by now she has her asylum, or at least that baby is an American citizen. Our borders are so porous that, in order to illustrate how bad they are, we had James O'Keefe, who went down and put on an Osama bin Laden mask and walked across the border. Nobody bothered him. There was another individual that thought: I will make a bigger show of it. I will hire a mariachi band, and he rode a circus elephant across the Rio Grande River. That is how bad our border is. Now, here is how bad our law and our Constitution are. The mariachi band was serenading the Supreme Court today, Mr. Speaker, to try to convince them that we ought to see the Supreme Court rewrite law that Congress has written, that has been signed by a previous President, and every President since then has taken the oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. This constitutional balance that we have has seen a Supreme Court rewrite ObamaCare. So now they have the audacity to rewrite the law, and they are the ones that are deciding today, with eight Justices, sadly--sadly, not 9--as to whether or not the President of the United States can do what the Supreme Court did, in other words, rewrite the law. The President of the United States, 22 times, as the previous speaker, Mr. Brat, said, told America he doesn't have the constitutional authority to grant the amnesty, the executive amnesty that he did, whether it be DACA or whether it be DAPA. But then, after he deliberated for awhile, he checked his conscience. That didn't bother him. We shouldn't be amazed at that, Mr. Speaker. He already knew the Constitution. He lectured it to us. But what he checked was his politics, and his question was: Can he get away with it? Is there an enforcement capacity that could stop him? Well, he hadn't met yet Judge Hanen in Texas who, if these Justices in the Supreme Court deadlock 4-4, the President's executive amnesty, at least for DAPA, is going to be stalled for the duration of his administration. And so this prosecutorial discretion argument before the Court today that the Obama administration very well knew was the center of this case--and that prosecutorial discretion can be conferred on an individual basis only. That was the testimony of Janet Napolitano; and in the first Morton memo document, there were multiple references to an individual basis only. Her testimony was an individual basis only. But even the first document set out four categories, groups of people, whom the law would be waived for, and that is what we are talking about here. Who writes the law? If the President writes the law, how could we write one that would restrain this President that is out of line? Let's preserve our Constitution, and let's look forward to an appointment to the Supreme Court that actually means it when they take their oath as we do ours. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from Iowa for such great remarks and your passion and your leadership. It was great to see you in front of the Supreme Court today speaking passionately about this issue. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from the great State of South Carolina (Mr. Sanford). Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for doing this. I think it is such an important issue. I think that, as has been mentioned by a couple of speakers now, what is really at play here is a constitutional issue. The Founding Fathers were so emphatically clear that there were to be three different pieces of pie. There was to be an executive branch that administered the law, a legislative branch that created it, and a judicial branch that interpreted it. There is this amazing reservoir of common sense that exists out there with the American public. So what people told me back home is this is not about being against somebody from some other place. This is not about being against Hispanics. This is, in fact, about the rule of law and a system that our Founding Fathers gave us more than 200 years ago and how we preserve it. And how we preserve it is by actually sticking to it. Ultimately, the issue has less to do with immigration than it does to do with this larger notion of common sense and rule of law. I would also stress the common sense part. I remember back in the O.J. Simpson trial, there was this whole notion of, if the glove doesn't fit, you can't acquit. In this case, the glove doesn't fit from the standpoint of common sense. I actually had my staff pull up a couple of numbers this afternoon, and I think that they are fascinating, and here is what I mean by that. The numbers don't fit with the scale of every other amnesty that has been done for more than the last 50 years. Think about this. The amnesties that this President has proposed, in total, are about 5\1/2\ million people. That is more than all of the cumulative amnesties for the last 53 years, going back all the way to the time of Eisenhower. In fact, the average amnesty was about 32,000 people in size. We have all always been a Nation that has been welcoming; we have included other people. So if you look back at the El Salvadorans that Clinton and Bush allowed in, based on civic conflict and real civil war down that way, if you look at the Persian Gulf evacuees, if you look at the--my eyesight is getting so bad, I need to get glasses. If you look at the Chinese, after Tiananmen Square, if you were to look at Soviet refugees, if you look at the Ethiopians, the Lithuanians, even going back to the war orphans at the time of Eisenhower, there has been a remarkable case when amnesties were judged okay by this Congress, okay by the American people, okay by the President because of scale, 32,000 people, on average, per amnesty, for 53 years. Again, this President's amnesty dwarfs the total amnesties of all Presidents over the last 53 years, and, for that reason, the American public has reacted as it has saying this just doesn't fit. The other thing that I think is interesting, going back to the notion of sheer scale and the ways in which this particular amnesty that the President has proposed is at odds with every other for the last 53 years, is, if you were to add up the cumulative amnesties of this President, you would be in the top 20 States in the United States of America--5.5 million people. That is well above the population of South Carolina; it is well above the population of Alabama. Or go down about another 30 States, wherein you would have a de facto new State added that would be more than midway in the graph of all States in this country. It doesn't fit. A third point that I would make, and I think this is a fascinating one that my staff pulled, is that if you look at all those amnesties I was just talking about over the last 53 years, they have really fallen into a couple of baskets, the one big amnesty being back in 1986 which, ultimately, went through this Congress. It was, in fact, as a consequence of the act of Congress and the will of the American public. That was a big one. But the other one was the Adjustment Act of 1966, which goes back to the plight of the Cuban people and trying to do something about that. The other one has been a basket of natural disaster, of political strife, of family reunification. That has been a basket. And then there has been a basket for refugees. But never before have we had a basket that was about a political objective as opposed to a reaction [[Page H1796]] to an external event. We have had a long list of external events over 53 years that is at odds with what we see taking place. So not only is this important from the standpoint of the Constitution and the rule of law, as has been so eloquently stated thus far, it is something that doesn't fit common sense from the standpoint of scale. And there is one last point. There is a financial cost to this. The Cato Institute estimated that you are looking at about $14,000 per household. If you multiply that times the number of refugees that the President is talking about here, you are looking at about $19 billion in cost. That is about two-thirds of the dustup we have had over the budget. You are talking about $30 billion. Is the number 1070 or 1040? A $30 billion difference. In this case, two-thirds of that total would be taken care of just with this question of amnesty that is before us tonight which you, again, have brought, and I very, very much appreciate you doing so. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from the great State of South Carolina for those--I mean, those are great numbers that really illustrate the significance and the large amount of numbers that we are dealing with. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of Arizona, Dr. Paul Gosar. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for his leadership on this issue and for organizing this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken many times right here on the House Floor about upholding the rule of law. Whether it be about a lawless Attorney General who tried to cover up a gunrunning operation, or a rogue IRS Director illegally targeting innocent Americans, or a President attempting to enact amnesty by executive action, ensuring that the Federal Government is held accountable for its lawlessness has been one of my top priorities as an elected Representative to the people's House. And while the concept of equal application of the law may not seem like it needs any explanation, I would like to speak to the heart of why upholding the rule of law is so fundamental. Our laws seek to incentivize Americans to behave responsibly and to impose consequences when they don't. This is the fundamental contract woven into the fabric of our Republic. It is a concept envisioned by our Founding Fathers, not only to protect the individual rights of every man, woman, and child, but also to prohibit executive overreach from an intrusive Federal Government. Former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis captured these principles best when he stated: ``In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.'' Sadly, we are witnessing what happens when the Federal Government becomes a lawbreaker and breeds contempt for the law--anarchy. The Obama administration has created an immigration crisis as a result of its failure to enforce Federal immigration laws on the books. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported just last week that 2016 could set another record for the number of unaccompanied alien children crossing our southern border, and that from 2011 to 2014, unaccompanied alien children increased by 1,200 percent. Also last week, 1,000 Cuban aliens stormed the Costa Rica-Panama border demanding to pass so they could continue their journey to enter the United States illegally. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress clear jurisdiction on immigration matters, and President Obama's executive actions on immigration clearly infringe on that authority. The President even admitted that fact 22 times previously when he stated he did not have the authority to take the executive actions he ultimately ended up taking. {time} 2100 Justice Kennedy rightfully pointed out today that DAPA is a legislative act, not an administrative act. Thus, its creation is unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court should uphold the lower court's ruling that halted Obama's illegal actions. What incentive do Americans have to follow the rule of law themselves if they have no faith that their government will do the same? How can lawmakers ask immigrants seeking to migrate lawfully to our country to follow these rules when this President so blatantly violates those same rules? Unfortunately, if we don't take bold action now to hold the President accountable for his lawlessness, we risk permanently damaging the integrity of all our laws beyond all repair. The good news is there is a solution. The House must utilize our power of the purse to block any and all funding for the President's executive amnesty orders. I am attempting to do just that and recently spearheaded an appropriations rider supported by 35 of my colleagues to block funding for all executive actions on immigration dating back to 2011. Returning to the rule of law begins with the House enforcing its own constitutional power of the purse. We must fundamentally reject the President's legacy of lawlessness and renew the faith that we all place in the rule of law. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague for such wise words of wisdom. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of Colorado, Mr. Ken Buck. Mr. BUCK. I thank the gentleman from Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration somehow missed the class in civics about separation of powers, checks and balances, and so many other issues from our Constitution. Thankfully, the Supreme Court can offer some remedial education when it decides the case United States v. Texas. The facts of the case are simple. The President's executive action on immigration is downright illegal. He bypassed Congress, even though the Constitution explicitly states that the legislative branch has the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. This administration uses the excuse of prosecutorial discretion. As a prosecutor for 25 years, I can tell you this isn't true. When his executive order creates a new special class for millions of people in the United States, this isn't a case-by-case use of discretion. It is a blanket rulemaking, and it is rulemaking that directly contradicts the wishes of Congress. All three branches of government agree that these actions are illegal. Courts have already issued an injunction against the rule. Congress submitted a friend-of-the-court brief highlighting its proper role, and the President himself knows it would be unconstitutional to bypass Congress and create his own immigration laws. He said so many times. For some reason, he still went ahead and issued the executive order. Real people feel real consequences when we put the Constitution through the paper shredder. The President's actions will lead to devastating new costs for States. Our healthcare system, our judicial and law enforcement systems, and our education system will all be strained as they try to accommodate the President's unconstitutional orders. The judicial branch has a chance to stand up to executive overreach in this case and reassert congressional power. I hope the Court rules correctly because the fate of the Republic hangs in the balance. Mr. YOHO. Words spoken so true, and I appreciate that. The Constitution and the sovereignty of this Nation is what is at stake here, along with the institution itself. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, Mr. Jody B. Hice from the State of Georgia. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. I am grateful to my colleague from Florida for yielding this time. Mr. Speaker, today the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments on what certainly has every potential of being one of the most important cases of our time. Of course, we are talking about a case involving an unprecedented and inexplicable expansion of powers by the President. We all remember in November 2014 when President Obama, fresh from, I might add, losing midterm elections, announced his executive decision to [[Page H1797]] grant amnesty to some 5 million illegal immigrants. Immediately 26 States, my home State of Georgia being one of them, quickly moved to challenge this President's decision in the courts. Those States rightly and correctly argued that they were being forced by the Federal Government to bear the costly burden of this President's abuse of power. So after months of legal wrangling in the lower courts, now we watch United States v. Texas being considered in the High Court. We watched this being put on in the Supreme Court, and I am hopeful, as many of my colleagues, all of us here tonight, that the rulings from the lower courts will stand and that, ultimately, this President's executive amnesty will be ruled for what it is, a clear violation of the Constitution. That is what we are dealing with tonight, a violation of the Constitution, specifically article II, section 3, the faithful execution clause. Many ask: What is that? Basically, that clause requires the President to enforce the laws of the land. Is it too much to ask for the President to enforce the laws of the land as written by Congress and interpreted by the courts? This President has turned that upside down. He has turned our Constitution on its head with his own legislative policies from the executive office and the abuse of executive authority. Many of us here have voted multiple times to oppose many of the President's unconstitutional actions, and I have cosponsored many bills trying to deal specifically with his planned amnesty program. Going forward, now we have the Supreme Court case before us, and we all hope that they will see that what the President has done is a direct, gross violation of our Constitution. Again, I want to thank my friend from Florida, Congressman Yoho, for putting together this Special Order. Mr. YOHO. I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia for participating. Mr. Speaker, in closing, our institution of law is threatened more today than ever before. All evil or tyranny needs to succeed or for a constitutional republic to fail is for good men and women to be complacent and do nothing. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1793-H1797] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESTORING ARTICLE I CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

To some, this case is simply an argument over whether or not you are pro-illegal immigration. Let me repeat that. You are pro-illegal immigration or not. To others, this case is about keeping families together. To many, like myself, it is about protecting the dignity of our Constitution and the balance of powers within the three branches of government. The United States v. Texas is about the rule of law and defending the integrity of our great institution of government. We are a constitutional Republic. And yet, the President's mass deferred action on deportation of individuals residing within our country illegally would make it seem more like we are living in a dictatorship. The Constitution is clear on the issues of legislation. Article I, section 1 explicitly states: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.'' Let that sink in for a moment. ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.'' Article I, section 8, clause 4: ``to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' That is solely the responsibility of this body. Take notice of the absence of any reference to the executive office, executive branch, or judicial branch. Article II, section 3, however, states that the President ``shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' It is referred to as the Take Care Clause. That the laws be faithfully executed, not established, not rewritten, not selectively enforce portions of law, but to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. {time} 2045 That power is still delegated to Congress just as it was over two centuries ago. If the Supreme Court upholds the administrative executive action, I fear that our Republic--that is the United States--will die. We will see an end of a Nation that started by fending off tyranny. We will see the end of a Nation which has withstood a civil war, two world wars, and countless terrorist attacks. Terrorists hate the United States simply because of the manner through which we have prospered under the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. Again, the success of our Nation is because we are a land and a Nation of laws. I urge all of my colleagues in the House and the Senate to not falter in their defense of the founding principles upon which this great Nation was built. Interesting, today, at the Supreme Court, I was there to speak on these very topics. Many pro-illegal immigrants were present, and I found it very interesting they were shouting, demonstrating, exercising freedom of speech, freedom of speech and demonstrating in America, simply because we have a Constitution that protects that. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brat), my good friend and colleague. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss the case being heard before the Supreme Court, United States v. Texas, and the President's unconstitutional executive actions on immigration and the need for the restoration of the balance of powers between the branches of government. This case is the challenge to President Obama's executive actions for illegal immigrants, the so-called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, otherwise known as DAPA, an expansion of the earlier Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, otherwise known as DACA. The lawsuit was brought by Governors and attorneys general from the Texas Supreme Court and 25 other States. That is significant, in and of itself. Under these unconstitutional programs, President Obama claims the right to, by executive fiat, make an illegal immigrant ``lawfully present.'' Let me say that again real slow. The President claims, by right, by executive fiat, to make an illegal immigrant ``lawfully present'' in the United States and eligible to receive a work permit after an application is reviewed and a fee is paid. This is straight out of ``1984.'' The language is upside down. The government is handing out work permits and making illegal immigrants eligible to work in the United States as well as receive Social Security, unemployment, and disability benefits. But this only hurts American citizens and taxpayers. What has Congress done about this? Not enough. The real issue in this case is not discretion, but whether or not there is any limit at all on Presidential power. The Founders recognized these distinctions, and they made Congress the first branch among equals of the Federal Government and the most accountable branch to the American people--and thus, Article I, not II. The Congress is Article I. The Founders created a system of checks and balances to ensure no individual could gain absolute power within the government without a check, not even George Washington, whom they all loved. Under our Constitution, the Congress is entrusted with ``all legislative powers''--all, including the power ``to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' The Founders drafted the Constitution to clearly state that it is not the President who writes the laws; Congress does. Much of the President's job is to faithfully execute these laws passed by Congress. In fact, neither any immigration law nor the Constitution empowers the Executive to authorize, let alone facilitate, the violation of the laws passed by Congress. The President even acknowledged this 22 times on TV before using his pen and phone to act alone without Congress. This imbalance of powers is a threat to self-government itself. Our inaction, time and again, has expanded the administrative state and left the American people without a voice in Washington. The Presidential elections on both sides of the aisle are making this abundantly clear. For starters, we can advocate for reforms in four principled areas: reclaiming Congress' power of the purse, reforming executive-empowering legislative ``cliffs,'' restoring congressional authority over regulations and regulators, and reining in executive discretion. I have sponsored simple legislation to do just that: return power back to Congress. I introduced a bill to reform this process with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, the primary agency for implementing the President's immigration executive order. USCIS funds itself through application fees, which insulates it from the will of the American people as expressed through their Representatives in Congress. Congress cannot effectively exercise its powers through the appropriations process to perform basic oversight functions and ensure the agency is executing the laws faithfully. My proposal, the Use Spending for Congressional Immigration Supervision, USCIS, Act, will make unaccountable agencies like the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services accountable to Congress and, therefore, accountable to the American people. Putting USCIS on appropriations ensures that unelected bureaucrats are held accountable and provides transparency for how the Federal Government is raising and spending your money. Congress needs to reassert its power of the purse by making agency budgets subject to appropriations, but we cannot stop there. There is more Congress has to do to restore Congress' power to hold the executive branch accountable. The Constitution still gives Congress all its powers. It is up to Congress to step up and start using them. Mr. YOHO. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King). Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Florida for organizing this Special Order, for his leadership, for his constitutional convictions, and for the opportunity to address you tonight, Mr. Speaker, here on the floor of the House of Representatives. [[Page H1795]] I am listening to this dialogue that is taking place here on the floor, and this thought occurred to me that, several years ago, our borders are so open and our borders are so porous, and we have a President who has refused to enforce the law. In fact, he sends the message through his executive branch, if you are determined to enforce the law and you are a member of the Border Patrol, you had better find another job. I mean, that came out of the President and his leadership team all the way on down to our Border Patrol agents. I have been down to the border a good number of times, and I have watched as people come across the border in broad daylight, float across there in a raft. They get unloaded, stand there on the grass on our side of the river, and wait for the Border Patrol to come down with a welcome wagon and say: Would you like to apply for asylum? And, by the way, one of them was a pregnant lady, and so I am sure by now she has her asylum, or at least that baby is an American citizen. Our borders are so porous that, in order to illustrate how bad they are, we had James O'Keefe, who went down and put on an Osama bin Laden mask and walked across the border. Nobody bothered him. There was another individual that thought: I will make a bigger show of it. I will hire a mariachi band, and he rode a circus elephant across the Rio Grande River. That is how bad our border is. Now, here is how bad our law and our Constitution are. The mariachi band was serenading the Supreme Court today, Mr. Speaker, to try to convince them that we ought to see the Supreme Court rewrite law that Congress has written, that has been signed by a previous President, and every President since then has taken the oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. This constitutional balance that we have has seen a Supreme Court rewrite ObamaCare. So now they have the audacity to rewrite the law, and they are the ones that are deciding today, with eight Justices, sadly--sadly, not 9--as to whether or not the President of the United States can do what the Supreme Court did, in other words, rewrite the law. The President of the United States, 22 times, as the previous speaker, Mr. Brat, said, told America he doesn't have the constitutional authority to grant the amnesty, the executive amnesty that he did, whether it be DACA or whether it be DAPA. But then, after he deliberated for awhile, he checked his conscience. That didn't bother him. We shouldn't be amazed at that, Mr. Speaker. He already knew the Constitution. He lectured it to us. But what he checked was his politics, and his question was: Can he get away with it? Is there an enforcement capacity that could stop him? Well, he hadn't met yet Judge Hanen in Texas who, if these Justices in the Supreme Court deadlock 4-4, the President's executive amnesty, at least for DAPA, is going to be stalled for the duration of his administration. And so this prosecutorial discretion argument before the Court today that the Obama administration very well knew was the center of this case--and that prosecutorial discretion can be conferred on an individual basis only. That was the testimony of Janet Napolitano; and in the first Morton memo document, there were multiple references to an individual basis only. Her testimony was an individual basis only. But even the first document set out four categories, groups of people, whom the law would be waived for, and that is what we are talking about here. Who writes the law? If the President writes the law, how could we write one that would restrain this President that is out of line? Let's preserve our Constitution, and let's look forward to an appointment to the Supreme Court that actually means it when they take their oath as we do ours. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from Iowa for such great remarks and your passion and your leadership. It was great to see you in front of the Supreme Court today speaking passionately about this issue. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from the great State of South Carolina (Mr. Sanford). Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for doing this. I think it is such an important issue. I think that, as has been mentioned by a couple of speakers now, what is really at play here is a constitutional issue. The Founding Fathers were so emphatically clear that there were to be three different pieces of pie. There was to be an executive branch that administered the law, a legislative branch that created it, and a judicial branch that interpreted it. There is this amazing reservoir of common sense that exists out there with the American public. So what people told me back home is this is not about being against somebody from some other place. This is not about being against Hispanics. This is, in fact, about the rule of law and a system that our Founding Fathers gave us more than 200 years ago and how we preserve it. And how we preserve it is by actually sticking to it. Ultimately, the issue has less to do with immigration than it does to do with this larger notion of common sense and rule of law. I would also stress the common sense part. I remember back in the O.J. Simpson trial, there was this whole notion of, if the glove doesn't fit, you can't acquit. In this case, the glove doesn't fit from the standpoint of common sense. I actually had my staff pull up a couple of numbers this afternoon, and I think that they are fascinating, and here is what I mean by that. The numbers don't fit with the scale of every other amnesty that has been done for more than the last 50 years. Think about this. The amnesties that this President has proposed, in total, are about 5\1/2\ million people. That is more than all of the cumulative amnesties for the last 53 years, going back all the way to the time of Eisenhower. In fact, the average amnesty was about 32,000 people in size. We have all always been a Nation that has been welcoming; we have included other people. So if you look back at the El Salvadorans that Clinton and Bush allowed in, based on civic conflict and real civil war down that way, if you look at the Persian Gulf evacuees, if you look at the--my eyesight is getting so bad, I need to get glasses. If you look at the Chinese, after Tiananmen Square, if you were to look at Soviet refugees, if you look at the Ethiopians, the Lithuanians, even going back to the war orphans at the time of Eisenhower, there has been a remarkable case when amnesties were judged okay by this Congress, okay by the American people, okay by the President because of scale, 32,000 people, on average, per amnesty, for 53 years. Again, this President's amnesty dwarfs the total amnesties of all Presidents over the last 53 years, and, for that reason, the American public has reacted as it has saying this just doesn't fit. The other thing that I think is interesting, going back to the notion of sheer scale and the ways in which this particular amnesty that the President has proposed is at odds with every other for the last 53 years, is, if you were to add up the cumulative amnesties of this President, you would be in the top 20 States in the United States of America--5.5 million people. That is well above the population of South Carolina; it is well above the population of Alabama. Or go down about another 30 States, wherein you would have a de facto new State added that would be more than midway in the graph of all States in this country. It doesn't fit. A third point that I would make, and I think this is a fascinating one that my staff pulled, is that if you look at all those amnesties I was just talking about over the last 53 years, they have really fallen into a couple of baskets, the one big amnesty being back in 1986 which, ultimately, went through this Congress. It was, in fact, as a consequence of the act of Congress and the will of the American public. That was a big one. But the other one was the Adjustment Act of 1966, which goes back to the plight of the Cuban people and trying to do something about that. The other one has been a basket of natural disaster, of political strife, of family reunification. That has been a basket. And then there has been a basket for refugees. But never before have we had a basket that was about a political objective as opposed to a reaction [[Page H1796]] to an external event. We have had a long list of external events over 53 years that is at odds with what we see taking place. So not only is this important from the standpoint of the Constitution and the rule of law, as has been so eloquently stated thus far, it is something that doesn't fit common sense from the standpoint of scale. And there is one last point. There is a financial cost to this. The Cato Institute estimated that you are looking at about $14,000 per household. If you multiply that times the number of refugees that the President is talking about here, you are looking at about $19 billion in cost. That is about two-thirds of the dustup we have had over the budget. You are talking about $30 billion. Is the number 1070 or 1040? A $30 billion difference. In this case, two-thirds of that total would be taken care of just with this question of amnesty that is before us tonight which you, again, have brought, and I very, very much appreciate you doing so. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from the great State of South Carolina for those--I mean, those are great numbers that really illustrate the significance and the large amount of numbers that we are dealing with. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of Arizona, Dr. Paul Gosar. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for his leadership on this issue and for organizing this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken many times right here on the House Floor about upholding the rule of law. Whether it be about a lawless Attorney General who tried to cover up a gunrunning operation, or a rogue IRS Director illegally targeting innocent Americans, or a President attempting to enact amnesty by executive action, ensuring that the Federal Government is held accountable for its lawlessness has been one of my top priorities as an elected Representative to the people's House. And while the concept of equal application of the law may not seem like it needs any explanation, I would like to speak to the heart of why upholding the rule of law is so fundamental. Our laws seek to incentivize Americans to behave responsibly and to impose consequences when they don't. This is the fundamental contract woven into the fabric of our Republic. It is a concept envisioned by our Founding Fathers, not only to protect the individual rights of every man, woman, and child, but also to prohibit executive overreach from an intrusive Federal Government. Former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis captured these principles best when he stated: ``In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.'' Sadly, we are witnessing what happens when the Federal Government becomes a lawbreaker and breeds contempt for the law--anarchy. The Obama administration has created an immigration crisis as a result of its failure to enforce Federal immigration laws on the books. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported just last week that 2016 could set another record for the number of unaccompanied alien children crossing our southern border, and that from 2011 to 2014, unaccompanied alien children increased by 1,200 percent. Also last week, 1,000 Cuban aliens stormed the Costa Rica-Panama border demanding to pass so they could continue their journey to enter the United States illegally. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress clear jurisdiction on immigration matters, and President Obama's executive actions on immigration clearly infringe on that authority. The President even admitted that fact 22 times previously when he stated he did not have the authority to take the executive actions he ultimately ended up taking. {time} 2100 Justice Kennedy rightfully pointed out today that DAPA is a legislative act, not an administrative act. Thus, its creation is unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court should uphold the lower court's ruling that halted Obama's illegal actions. What incentive do Americans have to follow the rule of law themselves if they have no faith that their government will do the same? How can lawmakers ask immigrants seeking to migrate lawfully to our country to follow these rules when this President so blatantly violates those same rules? Unfortunately, if we don't take bold action now to hold the President accountable for his lawlessness, we risk permanently damaging the integrity of all our laws beyond all repair. The good news is there is a solution. The House must utilize our power of the purse to block any and all funding for the President's executive amnesty orders. I am attempting to do just that and recently spearheaded an appropriations rider supported by 35 of my colleagues to block funding for all executive actions on immigration dating back to 2011. Returning to the rule of law begins with the House enforcing its own constitutional power of the purse. We must fundamentally reject the President's legacy of lawlessness and renew the faith that we all place in the rule of law. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague for such wise words of wisdom. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of Colorado, Mr. Ken Buck. Mr. BUCK. I thank the gentleman from Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration somehow missed the class in civics about separation of powers, checks and balances, and so many other issues from our Constitution. Thankfully, the Supreme Court can offer some remedial education when it decides the case United States v. Texas. The facts of the case are simple. The President's executive action on immigration is downright illegal. He bypassed Congress, even though the Constitution explicitly states that the legislative branch has the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. This administration uses the excuse of prosecutorial discretion. As a prosecutor for 25 years, I can tell you this isn't true. When his executive order creates a new special class for millions of people in the United States, this isn't a case-by-case use of discretion. It is a blanket rulemaking, and it is rulemaking that directly contradicts the wishes of Congress. All three branches of government agree that these actions are illegal. Courts have already issued an injunction against the rule. Congress submitted a friend-of-the-court brief highlighting its proper role, and the President himself knows it would be unconstitutional to bypass Congress and create his own immigration laws. He said so many times. For some reason, he still went ahead and issued the executive order. Real people feel real consequences when we put the Constitution through the paper shredder. The President's actions will lead to devastating new costs for States. Our healthcare system, our judicial and law enforcement systems, and our education system will all be strained as they try to accommodate the President's unconstitutional orders. The judicial branch has a chance to stand up to executive overreach in this case and reassert congressional power. I hope the Court rules correctly because the fate of the Republic hangs in the balance. Mr. YOHO. Words spoken so true, and I appreciate that. The Constitution and the sovereignty of this Nation is what is at stake here, along with the institution itself. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, Mr. Jody B. Hice from the State of Georgia. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. I am grateful to my colleague from Florida for yielding this time. Mr. Speaker, today the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments on what certainly has every potential of being one of the most important cases of our time. Of course, we are talking about a case involving an unprecedented and inexplicable expansion of powers by the President. We all remember in November 2014 when President Obama, fresh from, I might add, losing midterm elections, announced his executive decision to [[Page H1797]] grant amnesty to some 5 million illegal immigrants. Immediately 26 States, my home State of Georgia being one of them, quickly moved to challenge this President's decision in the courts. Those States rightly and correctly argued that they were being forced by the Federal Government to bear the costly burden of this President's abuse of power. So after months of legal wrangling in the lower courts, now we watch United States v. Texas being considered in the High Court. We watched this being put on in the Supreme Court, and I am hopeful, as many of my colleagues, all of us here tonight, that the rulings from the lower courts will stand and that, ultimately, this President's executive amnesty will be ruled for what it is, a clear violation of the Constitution. That is what we are dealing with tonight, a violation of the Constitution, specifically article II, section 3, the faithful execution clause. Many ask: What is that? Basically, that clause requires the President to enforce the laws of the land. Is it too much to ask for the President to enforce the laws of the land as written by Congress and interpreted by the courts? This President has turned that upside down. He has turned our Constitution on its head with his own legislative policies from the executive office and the abuse of executive authority. Many of us here have voted multiple times to oppose many of the President's unconstitutional actions, and I have cosponsored many bills trying to deal specifically with his planned amnesty program. Going forward, now we have the Supreme Court case before us, and we all hope that they will see that what the President has done is a direct, gross violation of our Constitution. Again, I want to thank my friend from Florida, Congressman Yoho, for putting together this Special Order. Mr. YOHO. I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia for participating. Mr. Speaker, in closing, our institution of law is threatened more today than ever before. All evil or tyranny needs to succeed or for a constitutional republic to fail is for good men and women to be complacent and do nothing. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1793-H1797] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESTORING ARTICLE I CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on this evening's Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, if Congress does not assert its constitutional authority, we risk becoming obsolete in the eyes of an Executive that would prefer to legislate with a phone and a pen as a replacement for this body. Thank you to all my colleagues who join me this evening, and may God bless America. Every day, before Members of Congress meet to conduct official business, we gather to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States of America. We place our right hand over our hearts and promise to our colleagues, our constituents, and all Americans that we will uphold the rule of law. This very law is the very vehicle that has ensured liberty and justice for all even being a possibility: the rule of law. Unfortunately, this administration seems intent on operating outside the rule of law. It insists upon circumventing Congress by changing laws and legislating from the Oval Office, not from Capitol Hill. Time and again, the American people have had to bear witness to the blatant disrespect this administration has for [[Page H1794]] our Constitution. In my heart, I believe this disrespect is on full display in the embattled fight Congress and the American people find themselves in today with the executive branch at the Supreme Court.

I have been down to the border a good number of times, and I have watched as people come across the border in broad daylight, float across there in a raft. They get unloaded, stand there on the grass on our side of the river, and wait for the Border Patrol to come down with a welcome wagon and say: Would you like to apply for asylum? And, by the way, one of them was a pregnant lady, and so I am sure by now she has her asylum, or at least that baby is an American citizen. Our borders are so porous that, in order to illustrate how bad they are, we had James O'Keefe, who went down and put on an Osama bin Laden mask and walked across the border. Nobody bothered him. There was another individual that thought: I will make a bigger show of it. I will hire a mariachi band, and he rode a circus elephant across the Rio Grande River. That is how bad our border is. Now, here is how bad our law and our Constitution are. The mariachi band was serenading the Supreme Court today, Mr. Speaker, to try to convince them that we ought to see the Supreme Court rewrite law that Congress has written, that has been signed by a previous President, and every President since then has taken the oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. This constitutional balance that we have has seen a Supreme Court rewrite ObamaCare. So now they have the audacity to rewrite the law, and they are the ones that are deciding today, with eight Justices, sadly--sadly, not 9--as to whether or not the President of the United States can do what the Supreme Court did, in other words, rewrite the law. The President of the United States, 22 times, as the previous speaker, Mr. Brat, said, told America he doesn't have the constitutional authority to grant the amnesty, the executive amnesty that he did, whether it be DACA or whether it be DAPA. But then, after he deliberated for awhile, he checked his conscience. That didn't bother him. We shouldn't be amazed at that, Mr. Speaker. He already knew the Constitution. He lectured it to us. But what he checked was his politics, and his question was: Can he get away with it? Is there an enforcement capacity that could stop him? Well, he hadn't met yet Judge Hanen in Texas who, if these Justices in the Supreme Court deadlock 4-4, the President's executive amnesty, at least for DAPA, is going to be stalled for the duration of his administration. And so this prosecutorial discretion argument before the Court today that the Obama administration very well knew was the center of this case--and that prosecutorial discretion can be conferred on an individual basis only. That was the testimony of Janet Napolitano; and in the first Morton memo document, there were multiple references to an individual basis only. Her testimony was an individual basis only. But even the first document set out four categories, groups of people, whom the law would be waived for, and that is what we are talking about here. Who writes the law? If the President writes the law, how could we write one that would restrain this President that is out of line? Let's preserve our Constitution, and let's look forward to an appointment to the Supreme Court that actually means it when they take their oath as we do ours. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from Iowa for such great remarks and your passion and your leadership. It was great to see you in front of the Supreme Court today speaking passionately about this issue. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend from the great State of South Carolina (Mr. Sanford). Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for doing this. I think it is such an important issue. I think that, as has been mentioned by a couple of speakers now, what is really at play here is a constitutional issue. The Founding Fathers were so emphatically clear that there were to be three different pieces of pie. There was to be an executive branch that administered the law, a legislative branch that created it, and a judicial branch that interpreted it. There is this amazing reservoir of common sense that exists out there with the American public. So what people told me back home is this is not about being against somebody from some other place. This is not about being against Hispanics. This is, in fact, about the rule of law and a system that our Founding Fathers gave us more than 200 years ago and how we preserve it. And how we preserve it is by actually sticking to it. Ultimately, the issue has less to do with immigration than it does to do with this larger notion of common sense and rule of law. I would also stress the common sense part. I remember back in the O.J. Simpson trial, there was this whole notion of, if the glove doesn't fit, you can't acquit. In this case, the glove doesn't fit from the standpoint of common sense. I actually had my staff pull up a couple of numbers this afternoon, and I think that they are fascinating, and here is what I mean by that. The numbers don't fit with the scale of every other amnesty that has been done for more than the last 50 years. Think about this. The amnesties that this President has proposed, in total, are about 5\1/2\ million people. That is more than all of the cumulative amnesties for the last 53 years, going back all the way to the time of Eisenhower. In fact, the average amnesty was about 32,000 people in size. We have all always been a Nation that has been welcoming; we have included other people. So if you look back at the El Salvadorans that Clinton and Bush allowed in, based on civic conflict and real civil war down that way, if you look at the Persian Gulf evacuees, if you look at the--my eyesight is getting so bad, I need to get glasses. If you look at the Chinese, after Tiananmen Square, if you were to look at Soviet refugees, if you look at the Ethiopians, the Lithuanians, even going back to the war orphans at the time of Eisenhower, there has been a remarkable case when amnesties were judged okay by this Congress, okay by the American people, okay by the President because of scale, 32,000 people, on average, per amnesty, for 53 years. Again, this President's amnesty dwarfs the total amnesties of all Presidents over the last 53 years, and, for that reason, the American public has reacted as it has saying this just doesn't fit. The other thing that I think is interesting, going back to the notion of sheer scale and the ways in which this particular amnesty that the President has proposed is at odds with every other for the last 53 years, is, if you were to add up the cumulative amnesties of this President, you would be in the top 20 States in the United States of America--5.5 million people. That is well above the population of South Carolina; it is well above the population of Alabama. Or go down about another 30 States, wherein you would have a de facto new State added that would be more than midway in the graph of all States in this country. It doesn't fit. A third point that I would make, and I think this is a fascinating one that my staff pulled, is that if you look at all those amnesties I was just talking about over the last 53 years, they have really fallen into a couple of baskets, the one big amnesty being back in 1986 which, ultimately, went through this Congress. It was, in fact, as a consequence of the act of Congress and the will of the American public. That was a big one. But the other one was the Adjustment Act of 1966, which goes back to the plight of the Cuban people and trying to do something about that. The other one has been a basket of natural disaster, of political strife, of family reunification. That has been a basket. And then there has been a basket for refugees. But never before have we had a basket that was about a political objective as opposed to a reaction [[Page H1796]] to an external event. We have had a long list of external events over 53 years that is at odds with what we see taking place. So not only is this important from the standpoint of the Constitution and the rule of law, as has been so eloquently stated thus far, it is something that doesn't fit common sense from the standpoint of scale. And there is one last point. There is a financial cost to this. The Cato Institute estimated that you are looking at about $14,000 per household. If you multiply that times the number of refugees that the President is talking about here, you are looking at about $19 billion in cost. That is about two-thirds of the dustup we have had over the budget. You are talking about $30 billion. Is the number 1070 or 1040? A $30 billion difference. In this case, two-thirds of that total would be taken care of just with this question of amnesty that is before us tonight which you, again, have brought, and I very, very much appreciate you doing so. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from the great State of South Carolina for those--I mean, those are great numbers that really illustrate the significance and the large amount of numbers that we are dealing with. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of Arizona, Dr. Paul Gosar. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho) for his leadership on this issue and for organizing this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I have spoken many times right here on the House Floor about upholding the rule of law. Whether it be about a lawless Attorney General who tried to cover up a gunrunning operation, or a rogue IRS Director illegally targeting innocent Americans, or a President attempting to enact amnesty by executive action, ensuring that the Federal Government is held accountable for its lawlessness has been one of my top priorities as an elected Representative to the people's House. And while the concept of equal application of the law may not seem like it needs any explanation, I would like to speak to the heart of why upholding the rule of law is so fundamental. Our laws seek to incentivize Americans to behave responsibly and to impose consequences when they don't. This is the fundamental contract woven into the fabric of our Republic. It is a concept envisioned by our Founding Fathers, not only to protect the individual rights of every man, woman, and child, but also to prohibit executive overreach from an intrusive Federal Government. Former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis captured these principles best when he stated: ``In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.'' Sadly, we are witnessing what happens when the Federal Government becomes a lawbreaker and breeds contempt for the law--anarchy. The Obama administration has created an immigration crisis as a result of its failure to enforce Federal immigration laws on the books. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported just last week that 2016 could set another record for the number of unaccompanied alien children crossing our southern border, and that from 2011 to 2014, unaccompanied alien children increased by 1,200 percent. Also last week, 1,000 Cuban aliens stormed the Costa Rica-Panama border demanding to pass so they could continue their journey to enter the United States illegally. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress clear jurisdiction on immigration matters, and President Obama's executive actions on immigration clearly infringe on that authority. The President even admitted that fact 22 times previously when he stated he did not have the authority to take the executive actions he ultimately ended up taking. {time} 2100 Justice Kennedy rightfully pointed out today that DAPA is a legislative act, not an administrative act. Thus, its creation is unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court should uphold the lower court's ruling that halted Obama's illegal actions. What incentive do Americans have to follow the rule of law themselves if they have no faith that their government will do the same? How can lawmakers ask immigrants seeking to migrate lawfully to our country to follow these rules when this President so blatantly violates those same rules? Unfortunately, if we don't take bold action now to hold the President accountable for his lawlessness, we risk permanently damaging the integrity of all our laws beyond all repair. The good news is there is a solution. The House must utilize our power of the purse to block any and all funding for the President's executive amnesty orders. I am attempting to do just that and recently spearheaded an appropriations rider supported by 35 of my colleagues to block funding for all executive actions on immigration dating back to 2011. Returning to the rule of law begins with the House enforcing its own constitutional power of the purse. We must fundamentally reject the President's legacy of lawlessness and renew the faith that we all place in the rule of law. Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague for such wise words of wisdom. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of Colorado, Mr. Ken Buck. Mr. BUCK. I thank the gentleman from Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration somehow missed the class in civics about separation of powers, checks and balances, and so many other issues from our Constitution. Thankfully, the Supreme Court can offer some remedial education when it decides the case United States v. Texas. The facts of the case are simple. The President's executive action on immigration is downright illegal. He bypassed Congress, even though the Constitution explicitly states that the legislative branch has the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. This administration uses the excuse of prosecutorial discretion. As a prosecutor for 25 years, I can tell you this isn't true. When his executive order creates a new special class for millions of people in the United States, this isn't a case-by-case use of discretion. It is a blanket rulemaking, and it is rulemaking that directly contradicts the wishes of Congress. All three branches of government agree that these actions are illegal. Courts have already issued an injunction against the rule. Congress submitted a friend-of-the-court brief highlighting its proper role, and the President himself knows it would be unconstitutional to bypass Congress and create his own immigration laws. He said so many times. For some reason, he still went ahead and issued the executive order. Real people feel real consequences when we put the Constitution through the paper shredder. The President's actions will lead to devastating new costs for States. Our healthcare system, our judicial and law enforcement systems, and our education system will all be strained as they try to accommodate the President's unconstitutional orders. The judicial branch has a chance to stand up to executive overreach in this case and reassert congressional power. I hope the Court rules correctly because the fate of the Republic hangs in the balance. Mr. YOHO. Words spoken so true, and I appreciate that. The Constitution and the sovereignty of this Nation is what is at stake here, along with the institution itself. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, Mr. Jody B. Hice from the State of Georgia. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. I am grateful to my colleague from Florida for yielding this time. Mr. Speaker, today the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments on what certainly has every potential of being one of the most important cases of our time. Of course, we are talking about a case involving an unprecedented and inexplicable expansion of powers by the President. We all remember in November 2014 when President Obama, fresh from, I might add, losing midterm elections, announced his executive decision to [[Page H1797]] grant amnesty to some 5 million illegal immigrants. Immediately 26 States, my home State of Georgia being one of them, quickly moved to challenge this President's decision in the courts. Those States rightly and correctly argued that they were being forced by the Federal Government to bear the costly burden of this President's abuse of power. So after months of legal wrangling in the lower courts, now we watch United States v. Texas being considered in the High Court. We watched this being put on in the Supreme Court, and I am hopeful, as many of my colleagues, all of us here tonight, that the rulings from the lower courts will stand and that, ultimately, this President's executive amnesty will be ruled for what it is, a clear violation of the Constitution. That is what we are dealing with tonight, a violation of the Constitution, specifically article II, section 3, the faithful execution clause. Many ask: What is that? Basically, that clause requires the President to enforce the laws of the land. Is it too much to ask for the President to enforce the laws of the land as written by Congress and interpreted by the courts? This President has turned that upside down. He has turned our Constitution on its head with his own legislative policies from the executive office and the abuse of executive authority. Many of us here have voted multiple times to oppose many of the President's unconstitutional actions, and I have cosponsored many bills trying to deal specifically with his planned amnesty program. Going forward, now we have the Supreme Court case before us, and we all hope that they will see that what the President has done is a direct, gross violation of our Constitution. Again, I want to thank my friend from Florida, Congressman Yoho, for putting together this Special Order. Mr. YOHO. I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia for participating. Mr. Speaker, in closing, our institution of law is threatened more today than ever before. All evil or tyranny needs to succeed or for a constitutional republic to fail is for good men and women to be complacent and do nothing. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,28765,28765,28832,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [house] [pages h1793-h1797] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] restoring article i constitutional power to congress the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from florida (mr. yoho) for 30 minutes. general leave mr. yoho. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on this evening's special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from florida? there was no objection. mr. yoho. mr. speaker, if congress does not assert its constitutional authority, we risk becoming obsolete in the eyes of an executive that would prefer to legislate with a phone and a pen as a replacement for this body. thank you to all my colleagues who join me this evening, and may god bless america. every day, before members of congress meet to conduct official business, we gather to recite the pledge of allegiance to the united states of america. we place our right hand over our hearts and promise to our colleagues, our constituents, and all americans that we will uphold the rule of law. this very law is the very vehicle that has ensured liberty and justice for all even being a possibility: the rule of law. unfortunately, this administration seems intent on operating outside the rule of law. it insists upon circumventing congress by changing laws and legislating from the oval office, not from capitol hill. time and again, the american people have had to bear witness to the blatant disrespect this administration has for [[page h1794]] our constitution. in my heart, i believe this disrespect is on full display in the embattled fight congress and the american people find themselves in today with the executive branch at the supreme court. this morning, the supreme court heard oral arguments in the united states v. texas case, including 25 other states. to some, this case is simply an argument over whether or not you are pro-illegal immigration. let me repeat that. you are pro-illegal immigration or not. to others, this case is about keeping families together. to many, like myself, it is about protecting the dignity of our constitution and the balance of powers within the three branches of government. the united states v. texas is about the rule of law and defending the integrity of our great institution of government. we are a constitutional republic. and yet, the president's mass deferred action on deportation of individuals residing within our country illegally would make it seem more like we are living in a dictatorship. the constitution is clear on the issues of legislation. article i, section 1 explicitly states: ``all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states, which shall consist of a senate and a house of representatives.'' let that sink in for a moment. ``all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states, which shall consist of a senate and a house of representatives.'' article i, section 8, clause 4: ``to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' that is solely the responsibility of this body. take notice of the absence of any reference to the executive office, executive branch, or judicial branch. article ii, section 3, however, states that the president ``shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' it is referred to as the take care clause. that the laws be faithfully executed, not established, not rewritten, not selectively enforce portions of law, but to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. {time} 2045 that power is still delegated to congress just as it was over two centuries ago. if the supreme court upholds the administrative executive action, i fear that our republic--that is the united states--will die. we will see an end of a nation that started by fending off tyranny. we will see the end of a nation which has withstood a civil war, two world wars, and countless terrorist attacks. terrorists hate the united states simply because of the manner through which we have prospered under the freedoms enshrined in the constitution. again, the success of our nation is because we are a land and a nation of laws. i urge all of my colleagues in the house and the senate to not falter in their defense of the founding principles upon which this great nation was built. interesting, today, at the supreme court, i was there to speak on these very topics. many pro-illegal immigrants were present, and i found it very interesting they were shouting, demonstrating, exercising freedom of speech, freedom of speech and demonstrating in america, simply because we have a constitution that protects that. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from virginia (mr. brat), my good friend and colleague. mr. brat. mr. speaker, today i rise to discuss the case being heard before the supreme court, united states v. texas, and the president's unconstitutional executive actions on immigration and the need for the restoration of the balance of powers between the branches of government. this case is the challenge to president obama's executive actions for illegal immigrants, the so-called deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents, otherwise known as dapa, an expansion of the earlier deferred action for childhood arrivals, otherwise known as daca. the lawsuit was brought by governors and attorneys general from the texas supreme court and 25 other states. that is significant, in and of itself. under these unconstitutional programs, president obama claims the right to, by executive fiat, make an illegal immigrant ``lawfully present.'' let me say that again real slow. the president claims, by right, by executive fiat, to make an illegal immigrant ``lawfully present'' in the united states and eligible to receive a work permit after an application is reviewed and a fee is paid. this is straight out of ``1984.'' the language is upside down. the government is handing out work permits and making illegal immigrants eligible to work in the united states as well as receive social security, unemployment, and disability benefits. but this only hurts american citizens and taxpayers. what has congress done about this? not enough. the real issue in this case is not discretion, but whether or not there is any limit at all on presidential power. the founders recognized these distinctions, and they made congress the first branch among equals of the federal government and the most accountable branch to the american people--and thus, article i, not ii. the congress is article i. the founders created a system of checks and balances to ensure no individual could gain absolute power within the government without a check, not even george washington, whom they all loved. under our constitution, the congress is entrusted with ``all legislative powers''--all, including the power ``to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.'' the founders drafted the constitution to clearly state that it is not the president who writes the laws; congress does. much of the president's job is to faithfully execute these laws passed by congress. in fact, neither any immigration law nor the constitution empowers the executive to authorize, let alone facilitate, the violation of the laws passed by congress. the president even acknowledged this 22 times on tv before using his pen and phone to act alone without congress. this imbalance of powers is a threat to self-government itself. our inaction, time and again, has expanded the administrative state and left the american people without a voice in washington. the presidential elections on both sides of the aisle are making this abundantly clear. for starters, we can advocate for reforms in four principled areas: reclaiming congress' power of the purse, reforming executive-empowering legislative ``cliffs,'' restoring congressional authority over regulations and regulators, and reining in executive discretion. i have sponsored simple legislation to do just that: return power back to congress. i introduced a bill to reform this process with the u.s. citizenship and immigration services, uscis, the primary agency for implementing the president's immigration executive order. uscis funds itself through application fees, which insulates it from the will of the american people as expressed through their representatives in congress. congress cannot effectively exercise its powers through the appropriations process to perform basic oversight functions and ensure the agency is executing the laws faithfully. my proposal, the use spending for congressional immigration supervision, uscis, act, will make unaccountable agencies like the u.s. citizenship and immigration services accountable to congress and, therefore, accountable to the american people. putting uscis on appropriations ensures that unelected bureaucrats are held accountable and provides transparency for how the federal government is raising and spending your money. congress needs to reassert its power of the purse by making agency budgets subject to appropriations, but we cannot stop there. there is more congress has to do to restore congress' power to hold the executive branch accountable. the constitution still gives congress all its powers. it is up to congress to step up and start using them. mr. yoho. i thank the gentleman for his comments. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from iowa (mr. king). mr. king of iowa. i thank the gentleman from florida for organizing this special order, for his leadership, for his constitutional convictions, and for the opportunity to address you tonight, mr. speaker, here on the floor of the house of representatives. [[page h1795]] i am listening to this dialogue that is taking place here on the floor, and this thought occurred to me that, several years ago, our borders are so open and our borders are so porous, and we have a president who has refused to enforce the law. in fact, he sends the message through his executive branch, if you are determined to enforce the law and you are a member of the border patrol, you had better find another job. i mean, that came out of the president and his leadership team all the way on down to our border patrol agents. i have been down to the border a good number of times, and i have watched as people come across the border in broad daylight, float across there in a raft. they get unloaded, stand there on the grass on our side of the river, and wait for the border patrol to come down with a welcome wagon and say: would you like to apply for asylum? and, by the way, one of them was a pregnant lady, and so i am sure by now she has her asylum, or at least that baby is an american citizen. our borders are so porous that, in order to illustrate how bad they are, we had james o'keefe, who went down and put on an osama bin laden mask and walked across the border. nobody bothered him. there was another individual that thought: i will make a bigger show of it. i will hire a mariachi band, and he rode a circus elephant across the rio grande river. that is how bad our border is. now, here is how bad our law and our constitution are. the mariachi band was serenading the supreme court today, mr. speaker, to try to convince them that we ought to see the supreme court rewrite law that congress has written, that has been signed by a previous president, and every president since then has taken the oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states. this constitutional balance that we have has seen a supreme court rewrite obamacare. so now they have the audacity to rewrite the law, and they are the ones that are deciding today, with eight justices, sadly--sadly, not 9--as to whether or not the president of the united states can do what the supreme court did, in other words, rewrite the law. the president of the united states, 22 times, as the previous speaker, mr. brat, said, told america he doesn't have the constitutional authority to grant the amnesty, the executive amnesty that he did, whether it be daca or whether it be dapa. but then, after he deliberated for awhile, he checked his conscience. that didn't bother him. we shouldn't be amazed at that, mr. speaker. he already knew the constitution. he lectured it to us. but what he checked was his politics, and his question was: can he get away with it? is there an enforcement capacity that could stop him? well, he hadn't met yet judge hanen in texas who, if these justices in the supreme court deadlock 4-4, the president's executive amnesty, at least for dapa, is going to be stalled for the

appointment to the supreme court that actually means it when they take their oath as we do ours. mr. yoho. i thank my colleague from iowa for such great remarks and your passion and your leadership. it was great to see you in front of the supreme court today speaking passionately about this issue. mr. speaker, i yield to my good friend from the great state of south carolina (mr. sanford). mr.

will of the american public. that was a big one. but the other one was the adjustment act of 1966, which goes back to the plight of the cuban people and trying to do something about that. the other one has been a basket of natural disaster, of political strife, of family reunification. that has been a basket. and then there has been a basket for refugees. but never before have we had a basket that was about a political objective as opposed to a reaction [[page h1796]] to an external event. we have had a long list of external events over 53 years that is at odds with what we see taking place. so not only is this important from the standpoint of the constitution and the rule of law, as has been so eloquently stated thus far, it is something that doesn't fit common sense from the standpoint of scale. and there is one last point. there is a financial cost to this. the cato institute estimated that you are looking at about $14,000 per household. if you multiply that times the number of refugees that the president is talking about here, you are looking at about $19 billion in cost. that is about two-thirds of the dustup we have had over the budget. you are talking about $30 billion. is the number 1070 or 1040? a $30 billion difference. in this case, two-thirds of that total would be taken care of just with this question of amnesty that is before us tonight which you, again, have brought, and i very, very much appreciate you doing so. mr. yoho. i thank my colleague from the great state of south carolina for those--i mean, those are great numbers that really illustrate the significance and the large amount of numbers that we are dealing with. mr. speaker, i yield to my colleague from the state of arizona, dr. paul gosar. mr. gosar. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from florida (mr. yoho) for his leadership on this issue and for organizing this special order. mr. speaker, i have spoken many times right here on the house floor about upholding the rule of law. whether it be about a lawless attorney general who tried to cover up a gunrunning operation, or a rogue irs director illegally targeting innocent americans, or a president attempting to enact amnesty by executive action, ensuring that the federal government is held accountable for its lawlessness has been one of my top priorities as an elected representative to the people's house. and while the concept of equal application of the law may not seem like it needs any explanation, i would like to speak to the heart of why upholding the rule of law is so fundamental. our laws seek to incentivize americans to behave responsibly and to impose consequences when they don't. this is the fundamental contract woven into the fabric of our republic. it is a concept envisioned by our founding fathers, not only to protect the individual rights of every man, woman, and child, but also to prohibit executive overreach from an intrusive federal government. former supreme court justice louis brandeis captured these principles best when he stated: ``in a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. for good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. crime is contagious. if the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.'' sadly, we are witnessing what happens when the federal government becomes a lawbreaker and breeds contempt for the law--anarchy. the obama administration has created an immigration crisis as a result of its failure to enforce federal immigration laws on the books. the nonpartisan congressional research service reported just last week that 2016 could set another record for the number of unaccompanied alien children crossing our southern border, and that from 2011 to 2014, unaccompanied alien children increased by 1,200 percent. also last week, 1,000 cuban aliens stormed the costa rica-panama border demanding to pass so they could continue their journey to enter the united states illegally. article i, section 8 of the constitution gives congress clear jurisdiction on immigration matters, and president obama's executive actions on immigration clearly infringe on that authority. the president even admitted that fact 22 times previously when he stated he did not have the authority to take the executive actions he ultimately ended up taking. {time} 2100 justice kennedy rightfully pointed out today that dapa is a legislative act, not an administrative act. thus, its creation is unconstitutional, and the supreme court should uphold the lower court's ruling that halted obama's illegal actions. what incentive do americans have to follow the rule of law themselves if they have no faith that their government will do the same? how can lawmakers ask immigrants seeking to migrate lawfully to our country to follow these rules when this president so blatantly violates those same rules? unfortunately, if we don't take bold action now to hold the president accountable for his lawlessness, we risk permanently damaging the integrity of all our laws beyond all repair. the good news is there is a solution. the house must utilize our power of the purse to block any and all funding for the president's executive amnesty orders. i am attempting to do just that and recently spearheaded an appropriations rider supported by 35 of my colleagues to block funding for all executive actions on immigration dating back to 2011. returning to the rule of law begins with the house enforcing its own constitutional power of the purse. we must fundamentally reject the president's legacy of lawlessness and renew the faith that we all place in the rule of law. mr. yoho. i thank my colleague for such wise words of wisdom. at this time, mr. speaker, i yield to my colleague from the state of colorado, mr. ken buck. mr. buck. i thank the gentleman from florida. mr. speaker, the obama administration somehow missed the class in civics about separation of powers, checks and balances, and so many other issues from our constitution. thankfully, the supreme court can offer some remedial education when it decides the case united states v. texas. the facts of the case are simple. the president's executive action on immigration is downright illegal. he bypassed congress, even though the constitution explicitly states that the legislative branch has the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. this administration uses the excuse of prosecutorial discretion. as a prosecutor for 25 years, i can tell you this isn't true. when his executive order creates a new special class for millions of people in the united states, this isn't a case-by-case use of discretion. it is a blanket rulemaking, and it is rulemaking that directly contradicts the wishes of congress. all three branches of government agree that these actions are illegal. courts have already issued an injunction against the rule. congress submitted a friend-of-the-court brief highlighting its proper role, and the president himself knows it would be unconstitutional to bypass congress and create his own immigration laws. he said so many times. for some reason, he still went ahead and issued the executive order. real people feel real consequences when we put the constitution through the paper shredder. the president's actions will lead to devastating new costs for states. our healthcare system, our judicial and law enforcement systems, and our education system will all be strained as they try to accommodate the president's unconstitutional orders. the judicial branch has a chance to stand up to executive overreach in this case and reassert congressional power. i hope the court rules correctly because the fate of the republic hangs in the balance. mr. yoho. words spoken so true, and i appreciate that. the constitution and the sovereignty of this nation is what is at stake here, along with the institution itself. mr. speaker, i yield to my good friend, mr. jody b. hice from the state of georgia. mr. jody b. hice of georgia. i am grateful to my colleague from florida for yielding this time. mr. speaker, today the united states supreme court heard oral arguments on what certainly has every potential of being one of the most important cases of our time. of course, we are talking about a case involving an unprecedented and inexplicable expansion of powers by the president. we all remember in november 2014 when president obama, fresh from, i might add, losing midterm elections, announced his executive decision to [[page h1797]] grant amnesty to some 5 million illegal immigrants. immediately 26 states, my home state of georgia being one of them, quickly moved to challenge this president's decision in the courts. those states rightly and correctly argued that they were being forced by the federal government to bear the costly burden of this president's abuse of power. so after months of legal wrangling in the lower courts, now we watch united states v. texas being considered in the high court. we watched this being put on in the supreme court, and i am hopeful, as many of my colleagues, all of us here tonight, that the rulings from the lower courts will stand and that, ultimately, this president's executive amnesty will be ruled for what it is, a clear violation of the constitution. that is what we are dealing with tonight, a violation of the constitution, specifically article ii, section 3, the faithful execution clause. many ask: what is that? basically, that clause requires the president to enforce the laws of the land. is it too much to ask for the president to enforce the laws of the land as written by congress and interpreted by the courts? this president has turned that upside down. he has turned our constitution on its head with his own legislative policies from the executive office and the abuse of executive authority. many of us here have voted multiple times to oppose many of the president's unconstitutional actions, and i have cosponsored many bills trying to deal specifically with his planned amnesty program. going forward, now we have the supreme court case before us, and we all hope that they will see that what the president has done is a direct, gross violation of our constitution. again, i want to thank my friend from florida, congressman yoho, for putting together this special order. mr. yoho. i would like to thank my colleague from georgia for participating. mr. speaker, in closing, our institution of law is threatened more today than ever before. all evil or tyranny needs to succeed or for a constitutional republic to fail is for good men and women to be complacent and do nothing. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president. ____________________",28765
CREC-2016-04-18-pt1-PgH1797,CREC-2016-04-18,114,ISSUES OF THE DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1797-H1799] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends, as led by our friend, Congressman Ted Yoho from Florida, and our friend from Georgia, Brother Hice. We heard great comments from Dr. Gosar and our friend, Steve King, from Iowa. These are deeply troubling times, and the Supreme Court taking up United States v. Texas really accentuates that issue. Sometimes it is nice to just pause and pay tribute to folks, for example, a beautiful couple here. It is a pastor. His name is Pastor Jesse Estrada Sabillon and his wife, Maria Sabillon. They are with their granddaughter in this picture. They are a beautiful couple. You can feel the love emanating from the picture. Pastor Jesse Estrada Sabillon was a Baptist minister at Nuevo Amanecer Baptist Church of Houston in the Cloverleaf area. He was an excellent carpenter. He owned a home remodeling business, J J & Sons Remodeling. His wife, Maria,--you can tell she loves her granddaughter--was a retired home caregiver for children with special needs. They were a beautiful couple. Mr. Sabillon never accepted a salary from the church and instead relied upon his job as a carpenter to feed his family. So it appears that Pastor Sabillon was working and acting in the vein of the Apostles Peter and Paul. Particularly Paul didn't want to be a burden to others. So he made tents, sewed, and did whatever he needed to so that he wasn't a burden to others. Instead of being a burden to others, Pastor Sabillon and his wife, Maria, were a blessing to Texas. They were a blessing to the Houston area and to so many whom they helped, the special needs kids that Maria helped with. {time} 2115 It appears that Jesse, Pastor Sabillon, was doing what Jesus said to do, to be a light to others, to be salt to the world, to administer to others' needs, or as Jesus told Peter, ``If you love me, you will tend my flock.'' Well, Pastor Sabillon did that and, apparently, did that very well. This story, April 15: ``Alexis De Larosa Sosa, 21, is a Mexican national who entered the United States illegally, HCSO''--apparently Harris County Sheriff's Office--``public information officer Ryan Sullivan confirmed in a phone interview with Breitbart Texas. ``His intake''--by this he means, Alexis De Larosa Sosa--``form says: U.S. citizen, no; alien status, illegal . . . De Larosa Sosa was wanted in connection with a street racing crash where Pastor Jesse Estrada Sabillon, and his wife, Maria Sabillon, were killed. The couple was driving home Tuesday night after visiting their niece who had just given birth to a baby when they were struck by the truck. ``The suspect is reported to have fled the scene following the crash and did not turn himself in until Friday morning about 10 a.m. local time. ``He was allegedly driving a 2006 Chevy pickup truck and was said to be racing with a dark-colored Dodge Challenger or Charger, the Houston Chronicle reported on Wednesday. The two vehicles were said to be racing along the Sam Houston Tollway feeder road when De Larosa Sosa is reported to have run a red light, striking the 2004 BMW 330 driven by Sabillon. The couple were both pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. De Larosa Sosa is said to have fled the scene on foot. The driver of the Dodge fled the scene in his vehicle. ``Officials with the Harris County Sheriff's Office quickly notified the family of the pastor who expressed relief at the news,'' talking about the apprehension of the suspect. ``De Larosa Sosa is currently processing into the Harris County jail and has not yet made a court appearance. He is expected to be charged in connection with the two homicides and fleeing the scene of the fatal accident.'' We know there are some wonderful people who have come into this country illegally. There have been. But there is no question that criminals have taken advantage of the situation to cross our border, since it has been porous, and to inflict crime on people of the United States. There should be little doubt about that. And then we have this story from the Washington Free Beacon: ``Number of Children Illegally Crossing Border Up 1,200 Percent Between 2011 and 2014.'' Ironically, it just happens to be, as people were finding out south of our border and in other parts of the world, that if you make it into the United States illegally, then you are probably going to stay. Odds are 97 percent you will stay. As border patrolmen have told me, drug cartels across our southern border call our Border Patrol, our Homeland Security, the logistics, and they laughingly say if they get people illegally into the country, then Homeland Security is the logistics that ships them wherever they want them to go in the country. As I have seen a number of times in the middle of the night as people are being processed, and like, for example, the one older lady who was asked how much she paid, some would say $6,000, some would say $7,000, $5,000, or $8,000. On a number of occasions, a border patrolman has challenged them: Where did you get that kind of money? You don't have that kind of money. It normally took repeated questioning to elicit an answer: Well, I paid $1,800 from family in this place, some people sent $2,000 from the United States, and I am going to pay the rest by working it off in the United States. They tell them where they want to go. Amazingly, Homeland Security has shipped people that have come into the country illegally all over the country. We have reports about Mexican drug distribution in all of our major cities. When you know that Homeland Security is shipping people that still owe the drug cartels money into different [[Page H1798]] cities, it is not hard to figure out how they are getting some of their less than happy workers helping them with their drug distribution. This article from Adam Kredo says in this Washington Free Beacon: ``The number of children apprehended on the U.S. border attempting to immigrate illegally has surged more than 1,200 percent since 2011, and the number of these children crossing the border during 2016 could be another record, according to a newly released government report. ``The number of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) illegally crossing the U.S. border `has increased sharply' since 2011, with a surge of more than 1,200 percent just between 2011 and 2014, according to the Congressional Research Service. The agency also disclosed that the flow is increasing significantly in the first 5 months of fiscal 2016. ``The illegal immigration of these children hit record-breaking numbers in 2014, with U.S. officials apprehending more than 52,000 alien children. Nearly 20,000 have been apprehended within the first 5 months of 2016, setting the stage for another potentially record- breaking year. `` `This unexpected surge of children strained U.S. Government resources and created a complex crisis of humanitarian implications,' the report said. `They increased in the first 5 months of FY 2016, however, and experts warn that significant migration flows will continue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the international community address the poor socioeconomic and security conditions driving Central Americans to leave their homes.' '' That is interesting, but I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that actually they will continue to surge as long as they are led to believe by the administration, and the evidence continues to indicate, that they will be allowed to stay in America, we will send them where they may claim to have relatives or where the drug cartels tell them to request to be sent. Just in the last few weeks, spending some days and nights on our border, our southern border, it is heartbreaking what you see because there are people that clearly want a better way of life. They are leaving the country of origin because their countries do not enforce the rule of law. There is graft, there is corruption, and the rule of law, the law is not evenly and fairly supported and enforced across the board. Therefore, the jobs aren't there. There are more opportunities here in the United States. Although we have breakdowns, we do try to enforce the law more evenly than, I would submit, anywhere in the world, at least until more recently when this administration makes exceptions of millions of people who are assured that they can violate the law with impunity and will be awarded for it. People come from countries where there is no equality under the law and they come to this country, as soon as they get here, for those of us that were out in front of the Supreme Court today, being shouted down by people who are angry, many of them shouting in Spanish--fine-- but we were told that people in their positions were all in the shadows. Now, I did see some people lounging around under a few trees, but most of them were not in the shadows. They were, in fact, on the steps of the Supreme Court right there in front yelling and screaming and showing disrespect for the U.S. national anthem and yelling, trying to prevent freedom of speech. It is just really interesting, seeing posters like ``Jesus was an immigrant.'' Well, sort of, but he never violated the law. He never encouraged anyone else to violate the law. In fact, he urged people to go forth and do wrong no more, but that is not the case. The great and really tragic irony of what is taking place is people coming to America illegally demanding that the laws not be properly enforced, not be fairly enforced. Sure, there have been millions and millions and millions and millions of Americans who have come through our system legally, but we are the millions that did not come legally and we demand to have the same treatment as if we did come legally. If we do that, it will not be long before we will be in the same shape as the countries these people fled from because there is not adequate opportunities. Since there is not adequate room for the billion or so that we have been told may want to come to America around the world, it would be far better to encourage their nations to end graft and corruption, to treat people fairly across the board. Here is an article from the Center for Immigration Studies. It says: ``The criminal aliens released by ICE in these years, who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes, are responsible for a significant crime spree in American communities, including 124 aliens charged with 135 new homicides. Inexplicably, ICE is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times.'' These are people that not only came into the country illegally, but have committed crimes multiple times, many of them, while they are here. At least they have certainly been charged with them. ``A total of 121 criminal aliens who were freed by ICE over the 5- year period between 2010 and 2014 were subsequently charged with homicide-related crimes within that time frame. Three more were charged in 2015. These 121 accused murderers were associated with 250 different communities in the United States, with the most clustered in California, New York, and Texas. ``These aliens were charged with a total of 135 homicide-related crimes after release. Two of them had homicide-related convictions even before they were released. These aliens had 464 criminal convictions prior to release by ICE. ``Another three aliens who were released by ICE during that time were charged with homicides during the first 10 months of FY 2015 . . . this tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions, nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ICE declined to take them into custody due to Obama administration prioritization policies. This list includes only those aliens that ICE arrested and then released.'' {time} 2130 ``The names of the criminal aliens were redacted by the Judiciary Committee, but the list presumably includes murderers like Apolinar Altamirano, an illegal alien who was arrested by ICE in 2013 following his conviction on local charges involving a burglary and abduction, but who was released on a $10,000 bond and permitted to remain free and elect to have deportation proceedings that would take years to complete. In January 2015, Altamirano shot and killed 21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck while he was working at a convenience store where Altamirano had come to buy cigarettes. ``ICE has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders, including the so- called Zadvydas cases in which the aliens' home countries would not take them back. The rest were released by ICE's choice.'' The article also points out: ``In 2014, ICE released a total of 30,558 criminal aliens from its custody. These aliens had already been convicted of 92,347 crimes before they were released by ICE. ``As of July 25, 2015, a total of 1,895 aliens have been charged with a crime after being freed by ICE. ``In a separate communication, ICE provided a list of countries that currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens: Afghanistan, Algeria, Burundi, Cape Verde, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe.'' We have the power to force these countries to either take back their citizens who have come illegally into this country or who are illegally in this country--particularly if they have committed crimes in this country--or have consequences. Instead, this administration chooses to provide benefits to countries like Iran and Afghanistan. For goodness sake. Make sure they are running Christians and Jews out of Afghanistan, but shouldn't they at least take back their own people? I was told by one of the leaders in Afghanistan--this is a few years ago--that their budget was around $12 billion a year. They only provided about [[Page H1799]] $1.5 billion. All the rest came from other countries, and most of that was from the United States. If they won't take their people back, then shut the government down. They will take their people back. This is ridiculous. Also, an important point was made in this article. ``As of July 25, 2015, only about 3 percent of the 30,558 criminal aliens freed by ICE in 2014 have been removed . . . ICE reports that 28,017 still had a pending immigration case as of July 25, 2015,'' but some of them don't show up for their hearings. Many don't. The largest percentage do not. They are just given notices to appear. ``Recent National Gang Unit-led operations include--'' and this is from a different article, from the article: ``ICE Arrests More Than 1,100 in Operation Targeting Gangs.'' It talks about all of the efforts to capture gangs. Let's see. ``Of the 1,133 arrests, 915 were gang members and associates; 1,001 were charged with criminal offenses; and 132 were arrested . . .'' It is just more and more numbers of drugs, firearms, currency. Again, about 3 percent, apparently, is all they are removing of those who are committing crimes in the country. Jessica Vaughan, from a year ago, had an article from May 28: ``The Non-Deported: ICE Still Releasing Criminal Aliens at a Rapid Pace.'' She documents, according to this article: ``The majority of convicted criminal releases occurred because of Obama administration policies that require ICE officers to let the offenders go. In some cases, judges will allow aliens to be released after a bond hearing, but the conditions are usually set by ICE, and ICE attorneys say that they have been instructed not to vigorously contest an alien's request for release,'' which brings us back to the Sabillons. My Christian brother and my Christian sister are gone; and we don't enforce our immigration laws as the oath taken by those in this administration require. I want to finish up by mentioning again about my being on the border. I was so struck. Texas has utilized and provided massive amounts of money to try to help us defend our border. The number one area through which people are coming into the United States moved some years back from Arizona to the McAllen corridor into Texas. I had occasion to be on a DPS boat with fantastic DPS officers. They had fantastic equipment that they were able to utilize to spot people who were clearly getting ready--behind bushes and whatnot--to cross the Rio Grande, from the Mexico side, into the U.S. It appeared, clearly, that some of them were just people who were going to be brought across, and some were carrying things. Maybe they were drugs. We don't really know. After we had spotted these folks when we were cruising down the river on the DPS boat--and there were a couple of Border Patrol boats that were much smaller, and there were other assets that allowed them to focus once we identified where these people were so that the Federal Border Patrol would know--and after we stayed silent for a while, we finally got a radio message from the Border Patrol that asked us to go ahead and return back to the dock way on down the river so that they could try to intercept these folks. Fine, because I know, if the Department of Public Safety sees a raft coming across, they will stop them. They do destroy the raft, which, as I understand, gets the coyote in trouble with the drug lord who sent him with the raft with people who had paid money to get them across. So the DPS would do that. They said: Why don't you go ahead. They are waiting for you to leave the area. Then we can interdict. We can catch them red-handed. It turns out that is exactly what they did. We spent massive amounts of money and effort in spotting people before they came across the river illegally. Whether it was bringing drugs, whether it was people coming across, we knew where they were. We spotted them, and we directed the Border Patrol to them. I say ``we.'' It is our Department of Public Safety people in Texas. We got word: That is exactly what they were waiting for. They came across after you left the area, and now we are in-processing them into the United States. We have the power to secure our border, but this administration has no will, and that is why unaccompanied children are up 1,200 percent. I have seen tiny, little girls, who couldn't have been more than 3 or 4, just in the last trip down, in the days I spent down there. Girls like them say: Oh, I am unaccompanied. I guarantee you they did not cross that river unaccompanied. They did not come 1,000 miles unaccompanied across Mexico. They were accompanied. Thank God they were not sold into sex trafficking as so many have been. When we in the United States, as I have been told by African friends--some of whom I have seen in the last month--say we are the hope of the world and when we don't follow the law, when we don't enforce the law, when we don't enforce our own laws, the world suffers. As Christians in Africa have told me: We know where we go when we die, but our only hope of having a peaceful life is if America stays strong. We haven't done that. Christians are now being persecuted in greater numbers than ever in history. Jews are being persecuted again as if we are headed toward a new holocaust. It is time for American leaders who have taken an oath to the United States Constitution and to this country to realize: to whom much is given, from them much will be required. There is going to be a day of judgment on America if we don't rise to the occasion and use what we have been blessed with. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1797-H1799] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore.

There should be little doubt about that. And then we have this story from the Washington Free Beacon: ``Number of Children Illegally Crossing Border Up 1,200 Percent Between 2011 and 2014.'' Ironically, it just happens to be, as people were finding out south of our border and in other parts of the world, that if you make it into the United States illegally, then you are probably going to stay. Odds are 97 percent you will stay. As border patrolmen have told me, drug cartels across our southern border call our Border Patrol, our Homeland Security, the logistics, and they laughingly say if they get people illegally into the country, then Homeland Security is the logistics that ships them wherever they want them to go in the country. As I have seen a number of times in the middle of the night as people are being processed, and like, for example, the one older lady who was asked how much she paid, some would say $6,000, some would say $7,000, $5,000, or $8,000. On a number of occasions, a border patrolman has challenged them: Where did you get that kind of money? You don't have that kind of money. It normally took repeated questioning to elicit an answer: Well, I paid $1,800 from family in this place, some people sent $2,000 from the United States, and I am going to pay the rest by working it off in the United States. They tell them where they want to go. Amazingly, Homeland Security has shipped people that have come into the country illegally all over the country. We have reports about Mexican drug distribution in all of our major cities. When you know that Homeland Security is shipping people that still owe the drug cartels money into different [[Page H1798]] cities, it is not hard to figure out how they are getting some of their less than happy workers helping them with their drug distribution. This article from Adam Kredo says in this Washington Free Beacon: ``The number of children apprehended on the U.S. border attempting to immigrate illegally has surged more than 1,200 percent since 2011, and the number of these children crossing the border during 2016 could be another record, according to a newly released government report. ``The number of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) illegally crossing the U.S. border `has increased sharply' since 2011, with a surge of more than 1,200 percent just between 2011 and 2014, according to the Congressional Research Service. The agency also disclosed that the flow is increasing significantly in the first 5 months of fiscal 2016. ``The illegal immigration of these children hit record-breaking numbers in 2014, with U.S. officials apprehending more than 52,000 alien children. Nearly 20,000 have been apprehended within the first 5 months of 2016, setting the stage for another potentially record- breaking year. `` `This unexpected surge of children strained U.S. Government resources and created a complex crisis of humanitarian implications,' the report said. `They increased in the first 5 months of FY 2016, however, and experts warn that significant migration flows will continue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the international community address the poor socioeconomic and security conditions driving Central Americans to leave their homes.' '' That is interesting, but I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that actually they will continue to surge as long as they are led to believe by the administration, and the evidence continues to indicate, that they will be allowed to stay in America, we will send them where they may claim to have relatives or where the drug cartels tell them to request to be sent. Just in the last few weeks, spending some days and nights on our border, our southern border, it is heartbreaking what you see because there are people that clearly want a better way of life. They are leaving the country of origin because their countries do not enforce the rule of law. There is graft, there is corruption, and the rule of law, the law is not evenly and fairly supported and enforced across the board. Therefore, the jobs aren't there. There are more opportunities here in the United States. Although we have breakdowns, we do try to enforce the law more evenly than, I would submit, anywhere in the world, at least until more recently when this administration makes exceptions of millions of people who are assured that they can violate the law with impunity and will be awarded for it. People come from countries where there is no equality under the law and they come to this country, as soon as they get here, for those of us that were out in front of the Supreme Court today, being shouted down by people who are angry, many of them shouting in Spanish--fine-- but we were told that people in their positions were all in the shadows. Now, I did see some people lounging around under a few trees, but most of them were not in the shadows. They were, in fact, on the steps of the Supreme Court right there in front yelling and screaming and showing disrespect for the U.S. national anthem and yelling, trying to prevent freedom of speech. It is just really interesting, seeing posters like ``Jesus was an immigrant.'' Well, sort of, but he never violated the law. He never encouraged anyone else to violate the law. In fact, he urged people to go forth and do wrong no more, but that is not the case. The great and really tragic irony of what is taking place is people coming to America illegally demanding that the laws not be properly enforced, not be fairly enforced. Sure, there have been millions and millions and millions and millions of Americans who have come through our system legally, but we are the millions that did not come legally and we demand to have the same treatment as if we did come legally. If we do that, it will not be long before we will be in the same shape as the countries these people fled from because there is not adequate opportunities. Since there is not adequate room for the billion or so that we have been told may want to come to America around the world, it would be far better to encourage their nations to end graft and corruption, to treat people fairly across the board. Here is an article from the Center for Immigration Studies. It says: ``The criminal aliens released by ICE in these years, who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes, are responsible for a significant crime spree in American communities, including 124 aliens charged with 135 new homicides. Inexplicably, ICE is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times.'' These are people that not only came into the country illegally, but have committed crimes multiple times, many of them, while they are here. At least they have certainly been charged with them. ``A total of 121 criminal aliens who were freed by ICE over the 5- year period between 2010 and 2014 were subsequently charged with homicide-related crimes within that time frame. Three more were charged in 2015. These 121 accused murderers were associated with 250 different communities in the United States, with the most clustered in California, New York, and Texas. ``These aliens were charged with a total of 135 homicide-related crimes after release. Two of them had homicide-related convictions even before they were released. These aliens had 464 criminal convictions prior to release by ICE. ``Another three aliens who were released by ICE during that time were charged with homicides during the first 10 months of FY 2015 . . . this tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions, nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ICE declined to take them into custody due to Obama administration prioritization policies. This list includes only those aliens that ICE arrested and then released.'' {time} 2130 ``The names of the criminal aliens were redacted by the Judiciary Committee, but the list presumably includes murderers like Apolinar Altamirano, an illegal alien who was arrested by ICE in 2013 following his conviction on local charges involving a burglary and abduction, but who was released on a $10,000 bond and permitted to remain free and elect to have deportation proceedings that would take years to complete. In January 2015, Altamirano shot and killed 21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck while he was working at a convenience store where Altamirano had come to buy cigarettes. ``ICE has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders, including the so- called Zadvydas cases in which the aliens' home countries would not take them back. The rest were released by ICE's choice.'' The article also points out: ``In 2014, ICE released a total of 30,558 criminal aliens from its custody. These aliens had already been convicted of 92,347 crimes before they were released by ICE. ``As of July 25, 2015, a total of 1,895 aliens have been charged with a crime after being freed by ICE. ``In a separate communication, ICE provided a list of countries that currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens: Afghanistan, Algeria, Burundi, Cape Verde, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe.'' We have the power to force these countries to either take back their citizens who have come illegally into this country or who are illegally in this country--particularly if they have committed crimes in this country--or have consequences. Instead, this administration chooses to provide benefits to countries like Iran and Afghanistan. For goodness sake. Make sure they are running Christians and Jews out of Afghanistan, but shouldn't they at least take back their own people? I was told by one of the leaders in Afghanistan--this is a few years ago--that their budget was around $12 billion a year. They only provided about [[Page H1799]] $1.5 billion. All the rest came from other countries, and most of that was from the United States. If they won't take their people back, then shut the government down. They will take their people back. This is ridiculous. Also, an important point was made in this article. ``As of July 25, 2015, only about 3 percent of the 30,558 criminal aliens freed by ICE in 2014 have been removed . . . ICE reports that 28,017 still had a pending immigration case as of July 25, 2015,'' but some of them don't show up for their hearings. Many don't. The largest percentage do not. They are just given notices to appear. ``Recent National Gang Unit-led operations include--'' and this is from a different article, from the article: ``ICE Arrests More Than 1,100 in Operation Targeting Gangs.'' It talks about all of the efforts to capture gangs. Let's see. ``Of the 1,133 arrests, 915 were gang members and associates; 1,001 were charged with criminal offenses; and 132 were arrested . . .'' It is just more and more numbers of drugs, firearms, currency. Again, about 3 percent, apparently, is all they are removing of those who are committing crimes in the country. Jessica Vaughan, from a year ago, had an article from May 28: ``The Non-Deported: ICE Still Releasing Criminal Aliens at a Rapid Pace.'' She documents, according to this article: ``The majority of convicted criminal releases occurred because of Obama administration policies that require ICE officers to let the offenders go. In some cases, judges will allow aliens to be released after a bond hearing, but the conditions are usually set by ICE, and ICE attorneys say that they have been instructed not to vigorously contest an alien's request for release,'' which brings us back to the Sabillons. My Christian brother and my Christian sister are gone; and we don't enforce our immigration laws as the oath taken by those in this administration require. I want to finish up by mentioning again about my being on the border. I was so struck. Texas has utilized and provided massive amounts of money to try to help us defend our border. The number one area through which people are coming into the United States moved some years back from Arizona to the McAllen corridor into Texas. I had occasion to be on a DPS boat with fantastic DPS officers. They had fantastic equipment that they were able to utilize to spot people who were clearly getting ready--behind bushes and whatnot--to cross the Rio Grande, from the Mexico side, into the U.S. It appeared, clearly, that some of them were just people who were going to be brought across, and some were carrying things. Maybe they were drugs. We don't really know. After we had spotted these folks when we were cruising down the river on the DPS boat--and there were a couple of Border Patrol boats that were much smaller, and there were other assets that allowed them to focus once we identified where these people were so that the Federal Border Patrol would know--and after we stayed silent for a while, we finally got a radio message from the Border Patrol that asked us to go ahead and return back to the dock way on down the river so that they could try to intercept these folks. Fine, because I know, if the Department of Public Safety sees a raft coming across, they will stop them. They do destroy the raft, which, as I understand, gets the coyote in trouble with the drug lord who sent him with the raft with people who had paid money to get them across. So the DPS would do that. They said: Why don't you go ahead. They are waiting for you to leave the area. Then we can interdict. We can catch them red-handed. It turns out that is exactly what they did. We spent massive amounts of money and effort in spotting people before they came across the river illegally. Whether it was bringing drugs, whether it was people coming across, we knew where they were. We spotted them, and we directed the Border Patrol to them. I say ``we.'' It is our Department of Public Safety people in Texas. We got word: That is exactly what they were waiting for. They came across after you left the area, and now we are in-processing them into the United States. We have the power to secure our border, but this administration has no will, and that is why unaccompanied children are up 1,200 percent. I have seen tiny, little girls, who couldn't have been more than 3 or 4, just in the last trip down, in the days I spent down there. Girls like them say: Oh, I am unaccompanied. I guarantee you they did not cross that river unaccompanied. They did not come 1,000 miles unaccompanied across Mexico. They were accompanied. Thank God they were not sold into sex trafficking as so many have been. When we in the United States, as I have been told by African friends--some of whom I have seen in the last month--say we are the hope of the world and when we don't follow the law, when we don't enforce the law, when we don't enforce our own laws, the world suffers. As Christians in Africa have told me: We know where we go when we die, but our only hope of having a peaceful life is if America stays strong. We haven't done that. Christians are now being persecuted in greater numbers than ever in history. Jews are being persecuted again as if we are headed toward a new holocaust. It is time for American leaders who have taken an oath to the United States Constitution and to this country to realize: to whom much is given, from them much will be required. There is going to be a day of judgment on America if we don't rise to the occasion and use what we have been blessed with. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [House] [Pages H1797-H1799] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends, as led by our friend, Congressman Ted Yoho from Florida, and our friend from Georgia, Brother Hice. We heard great comments from Dr. Gosar and our friend, Steve King, from Iowa. These are deeply troubling times, and the Supreme Court taking up United States v. Texas really accentuates that issue. Sometimes it is nice to just pause and pay tribute to folks, for example, a beautiful couple here. It is a pastor. His name is Pastor Jesse Estrada Sabillon and his wife, Maria Sabillon. They are with their granddaughter in this picture. They are a beautiful couple. You can feel the love emanating from the picture. Pastor Jesse Estrada Sabillon was a Baptist minister at Nuevo Amanecer Baptist Church of Houston in the Cloverleaf area. He was an excellent carpenter. He owned a home remodeling business, J J & Sons Remodeling. His wife, Maria,--you can tell she loves her granddaughter--was a retired home caregiver for children with special needs. They were a beautiful couple. Mr. Sabillon never accepted a salary from the church and instead relied upon his job as a carpenter to feed his family. So it appears that Pastor Sabillon was working and acting in the vein of the Apostles Peter and Paul. Particularly Paul didn't want to be a burden to others. So he made tents, sewed, and did whatever he needed to so that he wasn't a burden to others. Instead of being a burden to others, Pastor Sabillon and his wife, Maria, were a blessing to Texas. They were a blessing to the Houston area and to so many whom they helped, the special needs kids that Maria helped with. {time} 2115 It appears that Jesse, Pastor Sabillon, was doing what Jesus said to do, to be a light to others, to be salt to the world, to administer to others' needs, or as Jesus told Peter, ``If you love me, you will tend my flock.'' Well, Pastor Sabillon did that and, apparently, did that very well. This story, April 15: ``Alexis De Larosa Sosa, 21, is a Mexican national who entered the United States illegally, HCSO''--apparently Harris County Sheriff's Office--``public information officer Ryan Sullivan confirmed in a phone interview with Breitbart Texas. ``His intake''--by this he means, Alexis De Larosa Sosa--``form says: U.S. citizen, no; alien status, illegal . . . De Larosa Sosa was wanted in connection with a street racing crash where Pastor Jesse Estrada Sabillon, and his wife, Maria Sabillon, were killed. The couple was driving home Tuesday night after visiting their niece who had just given birth to a baby when they were struck by the truck. ``The suspect is reported to have fled the scene following the crash and did not turn himself in until Friday morning about 10 a.m. local time. ``He was allegedly driving a 2006 Chevy pickup truck and was said to be racing with a dark-colored Dodge Challenger or Charger, the Houston Chronicle reported on Wednesday. The two vehicles were said to be racing along the Sam Houston Tollway feeder road when De Larosa Sosa is reported to have run a red light, striking the 2004 BMW 330 driven by Sabillon. The couple were both pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. De Larosa Sosa is said to have fled the scene on foot. The driver of the Dodge fled the scene in his vehicle. ``Officials with the Harris County Sheriff's Office quickly notified the family of the pastor who expressed relief at the news,'' talking about the apprehension of the suspect. ``De Larosa Sosa is currently processing into the Harris County jail and has not yet made a court appearance. He is expected to be charged in connection with the two homicides and fleeing the scene of the fatal accident.'' We know there are some wonderful people who have come into this country illegally. There have been. But there is no question that criminals have taken advantage of the situation to cross our border, since it has been porous, and to inflict crime on people of the United States. There should be little doubt about that. And then we have this story from the Washington Free Beacon: ``Number of Children Illegally Crossing Border Up 1,200 Percent Between 2011 and 2014.'' Ironically, it just happens to be, as people were finding out south of our border and in other parts of the world, that if you make it into the United States illegally, then you are probably going to stay.

As Christians in Africa have told me: We know where we go when we die, but our only hope of having a peaceful life is if America stays strong. We haven't done that. Christians are now being persecuted in greater numbers than ever in history. Jews are being persecuted again as if we are headed toward a new holocaust. It is time for American leaders who have taken an oath to the United States Constitution and to this country to realize: to whom much is given, from them much will be required. There is going to be a day of judgment on America if we don't rise to the occasion and use what we have been blessed with. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,19879,19879,19946,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [house] [pages h1797-h1799] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] issues of the day the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) for 30 minutes. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i want to thank my friends, as led by our friend, congressman ted yoho from florida, and our friend from georgia, brother hice. we heard great comments from dr. gosar and our friend, steve king, from iowa. these are deeply troubling times, and the supreme court taking up united states v. texas really accentuates that issue. sometimes it is nice to just pause and pay tribute to folks, for example, a beautiful couple here. it is a pastor. his name is pastor jesse estrada sabillon and his wife, maria sabillon. they are with their granddaughter in this picture. they are a beautiful couple. you can feel the love emanating from the picture. pastor jesse estrada sabillon was a baptist minister at nuevo amanecer baptist church of houston in the cloverleaf area. he was an excellent carpenter. he owned a home remodeling business, j j & sons remodeling. his wife, maria,--you can tell she loves her granddaughter--was a retired home caregiver for children with special needs. they were a beautiful couple. mr. sabillon never accepted a salary from the church and instead relied upon his job as a carpenter to feed his family. so it appears that pastor sabillon was working and acting in the vein of the apostles peter and paul. particularly paul didn't want to be a burden to others. so he made tents, sewed, and did whatever he needed to so that he wasn't a burden to others. instead of being a burden to others, pastor sabillon and his wife, maria, were a blessing to texas. they were a blessing to the houston area and to so many whom they helped, the special needs kids that maria helped with. {time} 2115 it appears that jesse, pastor sabillon, was doing what jesus said to do, to be a light to others, to be salt to the world, to administer to others' needs, or as jesus told peter, ``if you love me, you will tend my flock.'' well, pastor sabillon did that and, apparently, did that very well. this story, april 15: ``alexis de larosa sosa, 21, is a mexican national who entered the united states illegally, hcso''--apparently harris county sheriff's office--``public information officer ryan sullivan confirmed in a phone interview with breitbart texas. ``his intake''--by this he means, alexis de larosa sosa--``form says: u.s. citizen, no; alien status, illegal . . . de larosa sosa was wanted in connection with a street racing crash where pastor jesse estrada sabillon, and his wife, maria sabillon, were killed. the couple was driving home tuesday night after visiting their niece who had just given birth to a baby when they were struck by the truck. ``the suspect is reported to have fled the scene following the crash and did not turn himself in until friday morning about 10 a.m. local time. ``he was allegedly driving a 2006 chevy pickup truck and was said to be racing with a dark-colored dodge challenger or charger, the houston chronicle reported on wednesday. the two vehicles were said to be racing along the sam houston tollway feeder road when de larosa sosa is reported to have run a red light, striking the 2004 bmw 330 driven by sabillon. the couple were both pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. de larosa sosa is said to have fled the scene on foot. the driver of the dodge fled the scene in his vehicle. ``officials with the harris county sheriff's office quickly notified the family of the pastor who expressed relief at the news,'' talking about the apprehension of the suspect. ``de larosa sosa is currently processing into the harris county jail and has not yet made a court appearance. he is expected to be charged in connection with the two homicides and fleeing the scene of the fatal accident.'' we know there are some wonderful people who have come into this country illegally. there have been. but there is no question that criminals have taken advantage of the situation to cross our border, since it has been porous, and to inflict crime on people of the united states. there should be little doubt about that. and then we have this story from the washington free beacon: ``number of children illegally crossing border up 1,200 percent between 2011 and 2014.'' ironically, it just happens to be, as people were finding out south of our border and in other parts of the world, that if you make it into the united states illegally, then you are probably going to stay. odds are 97 percent you will stay. as border patrolmen have told me, drug cartels across our southern border call our border patrol, our homeland security, the logistics, and they laughingly say if they get people illegally into the country, then homeland security is the logistics that ships them wherever they want them to go in the country. as i have seen a number of times in the middle of the night as people are being processed, and like, for example, the one older lady who was asked how much she paid, some would say $6,000, some would say $7,000, $5,000, or $8,000. on a number of occasions, a border patrolman has challenged them: where did you get that kind of money? you don't have that kind of money. it normally took repeated questioning to elicit an answer: well, i paid $1,800 from family in this place, some people sent $2,000 from the united states, and i am going to pay the rest by working it off in the united states. they tell them where they want to go. amazingly, homeland security has shipped people that have come into the country illegally all over the country. we have reports about mexican drug distribution in all of our major cities. when you know that homeland security is shipping people that still owe the drug cartels money into different [[page h1798]] cities, it is not hard to figure out how they are getting some of their less than happy workers helping them with their drug distribution. this article from adam kredo says in this washington free beacon: ``the number of children apprehended on the u.s. border attempting to immigrate illegally has surged more than 1,200 percent since 2011, and the number of these children crossing the border during 2016 could be another record, according to a newly released government report. ``the number of unaccompanied alien children (uacs) illegally crossing the u.s. border `has increased sharply' since 2011, with a surge of more than 1,200 percent just between 2011 and 2014, according to the congressional research service. the agency also disclosed that the flow is increasing significantly in the first 5 months of fiscal 2016. ``the illegal immigration of these children hit record-breaking numbers in 2014, with u.s. officials apprehending more than 52,000 alien children. nearly 20,000 have been apprehended within the first 5 months of 2016, setting the stage for another potentially record- breaking year. `` `this unexpected surge of children strained u.s. government resources and created a complex crisis of humanitarian implications,' the report said. `they increased in the first 5 months of fy 2016, however, and experts warn that significant migration flows will continue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the international community address the poor socioeconomic and security conditions driving central americans to leave their homes.' '' that is interesting, but i would submit, mr. speaker, that actually they will continue to surge as long as they are led to believe by the administration, and the evidence continues to indicate, that they will be allowed to stay in america, we will send them where they may claim to have relatives or where the drug cartels tell them to request to be sent. just in the last few weeks, spending some days and nights on our border, our southern border, it is heartbreaking what you see because there are people that clearly want a better way of life. they are leaving the country of origin because their countries do not enforce the rule of law. there is graft, there is corruption, and the rule of law, the law is not evenly and fairly supported and enforced across the board. therefore, the jobs aren't there. there are more opportunities here in the united states. although we have breakdowns, we do try to enforce the law more evenly than, i would submit, anywhere in the world, at least until more recently when this administration makes exceptions of millions of people who are assured that they can violate the law with impunity and will be awarded for it. people come from countries where there is no equality under the law and they come to this country, as soon as they get here, for those of us that were out in front of the supreme court today, being shouted down by people who are angry, many of them shouting in spanish--fine-- but we were told that people in their positions were all in the shadows. now, i did see some people lounging around under a few trees, but most of them were not in the shadows. they were, in fact, on the steps of the supreme court right there in front yelling and screaming and showing disrespect for the u.s. national anthem and yelling, trying to prevent freedom of speech. it is just really interesting, seeing posters like ``jesus was an immigrant.'' well, sort of, but he never violated the law. he never encouraged anyone else to violate the law. in fact, he urged people to go forth and do wrong no more, but that is not the case. the great and really tragic irony of what is taking place is people coming to america illegally demanding that the laws not be properly enforced, not be fairly enforced. sure, there have been millions and millions and millions and millions of americans who have come through our system legally, but we are the millions that did not come legally and we demand to have the same treatment as if we did come legally. if we do that, it will not be long before we will be in the same shape as the countries these people fled from because there is not adequate opportunities. since there is not adequate room for the billion or so that we have been told may want to come to america around the world, it would be far better to encourage their nations to end graft and corruption, to treat people fairly across the board. here is an article from the center for immigration studies. it says: ``the criminal aliens released by ice in these years, who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes, are responsible for a significant crime spree in american communities, including 124 aliens charged with 135 new homicides. inexplicably, ice is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times.'' these are people that not only came into the country illegally, but have committed crimes multiple times, many of them, while they are here. at least they have certainly been charged with them. ``a total of 121 criminal aliens who were freed by ice over the 5- year period between 2010 and 2014 were subsequently charged with homicide-related crimes within that time frame. three more were charged in 2015. these 121 accused murderers were associated with 250 different communities in the united states, with the most clustered in california, new york, and texas. ``these aliens were charged with a total of 135 homicide-related crimes after release. two of them had homicide-related convictions even before they were released. these aliens had 464 criminal convictions prior to release by ice. ``another three aliens who were released by ice during that time were charged with homicides during the first 10 months of fy 2015 . . . this tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions, nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ice declined to take them into custody due to obama administration prioritization policies. this list includes only those aliens that ice arrested and then released.'' {time} 2130 ``the names of the criminal aliens were redacted by the judiciary committee, but the list presumably includes murderers like apolinar altamirano, an illegal alien who was arrested by ice in 2013 following his conviction on local charges involving a burglary and abduction, but who was released on a $10,000 bond and permitted to remain free and elect to have deportation proceedings that would take years to complete. in january 2015, altamirano shot and killed 21-year-old grant ronnebeck while he was working at a convenience store where altamirano had come to buy cigarettes. ``ice has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders, including the so- called zadvydas cases in which the aliens' home countries would not take them back. the rest were released by ice's choice.'' the article also points out: ``in 2014, ice released a total of 30,558 criminal aliens from its custody. these aliens had already been convicted of 92,347 crimes before they were released by ice. ``as of july 25, 2015, a total of 1,895 aliens have been charged with a crime after being freed by ice. ``in a separate communication, ice provided a list of countries that currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens: afghanistan, algeria, burundi, cape verde, china, cuba, eritrea, gambia, ghana, guinea, india, iran, iraq, ivory coast, liberia, libya, mali, mauritania, morocco, sierra leone, somalia, south sudan, and zimbabwe.'' we have the power to force these countries to either take back their citizens who have come illegally into this country or who are illegally in this country--particularly if they have committed crimes in this country--or have consequences. instead, this administration chooses to provide benefits to countries like iran and afghanistan. for goodness sake. make sure they are running christians and jews out of afghanistan, but shouldn't they at least take back their own people? i was told by one of the leaders in afghanistan--this is a few years ago--that their budget was around $12 billion a year. they only provided about [[page h1799]] $1.5 billion. all the rest came from other countries, and most of that was from the united states. if they won't take their people back, then shut the government down. they will take their people back. this is ridiculous. also, an important point was made in this article. ``as of july 25, 2015, only about 3 percent of the 30,558 criminal aliens freed by ice in 2014 have been removed . . . ice reports that 28,017 still had a pending immigration case as of july 25, 2015,'' but some of them don't show up for their hearings. many don't. the largest percentage do not. they are just given notices to appear. ``recent national gang unit-led operations include--'' and this is from a different article, from the article: ``ice arrests more than 1,100 in operation targeting gangs.'' it talks about all of the efforts to capture gangs. let's see. ``of the 1,133 arrests, 915 were gang members and associates; 1,001 were charged with criminal offenses; and 132 were arrested . . .'' it is just more and more numbers of drugs, firearms, currency. again, about 3 percent, apparently, is all they are removing of those who are committing crimes in the country. jessica vaughan, from a year ago, had an article from may 28: ``the non-deported: ice still releasing criminal aliens at a rapid pace.'' she documents, according to this article: ``the majority of convicted criminal releases occurred because of obama administration policies that require ice officers to let the offenders go. in some cases, judges will allow aliens to be released after a bond hearing, but the conditions are usually set by ice, and ice attorneys say that they have been instructed not to vigorously contest an alien's request for release,'' which brings us back to the sabillons. my christian brother and my christian sister are gone; and we don't enforce our immigration laws as the oath taken by those in this administration require. i want to finish up by mentioning again about my being on the border. i was so struck. texas has utilized and provided massive amounts of money to try to help us defend our border. the number one area through which people are coming into the united states moved some years back from arizona to the mcallen corridor into texas. i had occasion to be on a dps boat with fantastic dps officers. they had fantastic equipment that they were able to utilize to spot people who were clearly getting ready--behind bushes and whatnot--to cross the rio grande, from the mexico side, into the u.s. it appeared, clearly, that some of them were just people who were going to be brought across, and some were carrying things. maybe they were drugs. we don't really know. after we had spotted these folks when we were cruising down the river on the dps boat--and there were a couple of border patrol boats that were much smaller, and there were other assets that allowed them to focus once we identified where these people were so that the federal border patrol would know--and after we stayed silent for a while, we finally got a radio message from the border patrol that asked us to go ahead and return back to the dock way on down the river so that they could try to intercept these folks. fine, because i know, if the department of public safety sees a raft coming across, they will stop them. they do destroy the raft, which, as i understand, gets the coyote in trouble with the drug lord who sent him with the raft with people who had paid money to get them across. so the dps would do that. they said: why don't you go ahead. they are waiting for you to leave the area. then we can interdict. we can catch them red-handed. it turns out that is exactly what they did. we spent massive amounts of money and effort in spotting people before they came across the river illegally. whether it was bringing drugs, whether it was people coming across, we knew where they were. we spotted them, and we directed the border patrol to them. i say ``we.'' it is our department of public safety people in texas. we got word: that is exactly what they were waiting for. they came across after you left the area, and now we are in-processing them into the united states. we have the power to secure our border, but this administration has no will, and that is why unaccompanied children are up 1,200 percent. i have seen tiny, little girls, who couldn't have been more than 3 or 4, just in the last trip down, in the days i spent down there. girls like them say: oh, i am unaccompanied. i guarantee you they did not cross that river unaccompanied. they did not come 1,000 miles unaccompanied across mexico. they were accompanied. thank god they were not sold into sex trafficking as so many have been. when we in the united states, as i have been told by african friends--some of whom i have seen in the last month--say we are the hope of the world and when we don't follow the law, when we don't enforce the law, when we don't enforce our own laws, the world suffers. as christians in africa have told me: we know where we go when we die, but our only hope of having a peaceful life is if america stays strong. we haven't done that. christians are now being persecuted in greater numbers than ever in history. jews are being persecuted again as if we are headed toward a new holocaust. it is time for american leaders who have taken an oath to the united states constitution and to this country to realize: to whom much is given, from them much will be required. there is going to be a day of judgment on america if we don't rise to the occasion and use what we have been blessed with. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",19879

Mr. President, Americans continue to see the difference a Republican-led Senate can make on behalf of our country. We have passed legislation to combat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, to provide a long-term highway funding solution, and to advance many other important issues. Today I am hopeful we will be able to add to that record of achievement with the FAA reauthorization and airport security bill, which aims to keep Americans safe in our airports and in the skies. Recent terror attacks across the world emphasize the importance of ensuring our airports are secure, and I am pleased the bill includes a number of provisions that will help to do so. From increasing security in prescreening areas to securing international flights arriving in the United States, to ramping up measures aimed at deterring cyber security attacks, this legislation contains the most comprehensive aviation security reforms in years. It also includes a number of passenger-friendly provisions such as refunds for lost or delayed bags and efforts to improve travel for those with disabilities. The bill accomplishes all this without raising fees or taxes on passengers and without imposing heavy-handed regulations that threaten consumer choice. The FAA reauthorization bill is the product of hard work and deliberation from Members on both sides of the aisle. It wouldn't have been possible without the leadership of Senator Thune, our Commerce Committee chair, and Senator Ayotte, the Aviation Subcommittee chair. They worked to consider amendments from both Republicans and Democrats that Members thought would make this good bill an even better one. I also thank their ranking member counterparts, Senator Nelson and Senator Cantwell, for their efforts to advance this legislation. Let's continue that bipartisan progress today and move the FAA reauthorization and airport security bill across the finish line. It is a win for passengers. It is a win for national security. It is another example of commonsense legislating under Republican leadership that is getting the Senate back to work. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2109] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the Senate Republicans are making history but for all the wrong reasons. The Republicans' obstruction of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, is the first of its kind in Senate history. Never before has the Senate categorically refused to consider a Supreme Court nominee solely because the vacancy occurred during an election year. As each day passes, the Republicans set some new mark for gridlock. For example, in the post-World War II era, the average time between a Supreme Court nomination and the nominee's first hearing was 29 days. Today is the 33rd day since Merrick Garland's name was put forward by President Obama. Already we are 5 days past the average. The longest a nominee has been forced to wait for a hearing was 82 days. That was President Eisenhower's nominee, Potter Stewart, who was confirmed at a later time. Republicans vow every day that there will be no hearing. So they are well on their way to eclipsing the 82-day mark. While that achievement may earn the Republicans a slap on the back from the Koch brothers and Senator McConnell--who, by the way, is the proud ``guardian of gridlock,'' as he says--Americans take no pleasure in this record-setting obstruction. Instead, Americans want Republicans in the Senate to do their job and give Merrick Garland a hearing. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2110] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MERRICK GARLAND NOMINATION Mr. REID.

That was President Eisenhower's nominee, Potter Stewart, who was confirmed at a later time. Republicans vow every day that there will be no hearing. So they are well on their way to eclipsing the 82-day mark.

CREC-2016-04-18-pt1-PgS2110-2,CREC-2016-04-18,114,IMMIGRATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2110] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IMMIGRATION Mr. REID. Mr. President, it has been almost 3 years since the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform. Senate Democrats worked with a handful of Republicans to craft a good, fair, comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed with strong bipartisan support. Then we watched as Speaker Boehner capitulated to the tea party radicals and refused to allow a vote on the floor. It would have passed overwhelmingly. To his credit, President Obama saw Republicans' inertia on immigration reform and decided to act. He told us in his State of the Union Address that he was tired of waiting around for Republicans to do things, so he had to do it himself, and that is what he has done. Using his Executive authority under existing law, he worked to fix the system to prioritize enforcement resources on those who actually pose a threat to our national security and public safety. On November 20, 2014, President Obama ordered a series of Executive actions that increased border security and ensured greater accountability throughout our immigration system. One aspect of President Obama's Executive actions was the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents Program. The program provided temporary deportation relief for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, if they meet three basic requirements. No. 1, they have to be in the country for at least 5 years; No. 2, they must register with the government; and No. 3, they must pass a criminal background check. Today, there are over 5 million children--all U.S. citizens--who are eligible for this program. President Obama also expanded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival Program, helping to protect DREAMers, the undocumented children who were brought to the United States at a very young age. To date, over 700,000 DREAMers have been protected--12,000 in Nevada alone. Not only were these Executive actions the right thing to do, they were also smart investments. Nevada will benefit from about a $3.5 million-a-year increase in State and local tax revenues. Nevadans will see an increase in earnings of more than $1 billion over 10 years. Together these programs will help grow America by $230 billion over the next 10 years, but now this progress is being threatened. Shortly after President Obama's announcement, a politically motivated lawsuit was filed by the Texas attorney general and joined by Republican Governors and attorneys--not all of them but a lot of them. The Texas attorney general won a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking both programs. This came from a single judge. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider the case and today it heard oral arguments. They were good. I thought it was an extremely sound, deliberate argument. I think the Justices--most of them--had questions that went to the heart of what the issues are, standing and other things. A decision to overturn the President's actions would put many families with U.S. citizen children at risk of deportation and prevent the Department of Homeland Security from doing its job of focusing on criminals and other threats to national security and public safety. In Nevada alone, President Obama's Executive actions stand to help 50,000 people. Those are 50,000 Nevadans who should not be separated from their families. The U.S. Supreme Court must do the right thing and recognize President Obama's authority. That is why I joined 38 other Senate Democrats and 186 House Democrats in filing an amicus brief with the Supreme Court, making clear that Congress granted the Department of Homeland Security broad discretion in enforcing our country's immigration laws. What the President did was both lawful and it was necessary. He helped target limited enforcement resources. It is also what every other President since Eisenhower has done, including Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Instead of litigating the President's lawful actions, Republicans should work to fix the immigration system in Congress. By working with Democrats to pass immigration reform, they would render the President's Executive actions unnecessary. I hope the Supreme Court decides in the administration's favor. I think they will, even though the Court is short a member. I hope these Executive orders are implemented to bring hard-working families out of the shadows, but our Nation would be far better off with a permanent solution. Our Nation would be far better off with a bipartisan, comprehensive overhaul of our Nation's immigration laws. My friend the assistant minority leader has been at the forefront of these immigration issues. The DREAM Act is something he put forward 15 years ago. I admire the work he has done on this. I think he has kept this issue alive, when a lot of Republicans wanted it to go away. He has been helpful to the people of Nevada--people who don't know his name and will never ever see him, but we have 12,000 DREAMers whose lives have been changed forever, and we hope the same will happen to their parents. Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2110] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IMMIGRATION Mr. REID.

The minority whip. Immigration Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first thank the minority leader, Senator Reid, for his kind words about the DREAM Act, which I introduced 15 years ago. [[Page S2111]] This was a piece of legislation that came about because a mother called my office in Chicago. Here was her family story. She brought her two kids to America from Brazil. They actually started off in Korea, but they came through Brazil and came to Chicago--mother, father, and two kids. The father had the ambition of starting a church. There are a lot of Korean churches around Chicago and around the country, and his dream was to start a Korean-American Church. His dream never came true. He continued to pray and read the Bible, but he didn't work much. It was up to mom to go to work. She went to work in a dry-cleaning establishment in Chicago. If you have been around the great city I am honored to represent and go into a dry cleaners, most of the time Korean families are running them. They are working around-the-clock, and are the hardest working people imaginable. Mom went to work in the dry cleaners and the kids struggled because there wasn't much money coming in. One of their girls, Tereza, heard about a program in Chicago called the MERIT Music Program. It is a program that is available for low-income families of kids in public schools. The lady who left the money for it said to give them instruction in musical instruments and help them buy the instruments. Tereza Lee heard about this when she was a little girl and decided to sign up for it and to practice the piano. Well, guess what. She turned out to be a prodigy. She was amazing. For her the MERIT Music Program was like an opening to another part of the world she had never seen. She participated in recitals. Sometimes they told me they had to give her a key to the Merit music offices because she wanted to stay and practice until late at night. It was tough for her getting through high school. She tells the story, when she was interviewed in the local press, that sometimes she didn't have a lunch to take to school or any money to buy food. She would wait until the other kids left, and she would go through the wastebasket and look for food they had left behind. That is how tough it was. But because of her skill at playing the piano, she was given an opportunity. She was accepted into the Juilliard School for music in New York and at the Manhattan School of Music conservatory to pursue the piano. She was that good. When she and her mom started filling out the application, they reached that point where it said this: What is your nationality? What is your citizenship? Her mom said: Tereza, I don't know. We came here on a visitor's visa way back when you were 2 years old, but I never filed any papers for you. She said: Mom, what are we going to do? Her mom said: We are going to call Durbin's office. So they called the Senate office. We looked into it. The law in the United States was very clear for 17-year-old Tereza Lee. She had to leave the United States for 10 years and apply to come back in--leave for 10 years. She came here at the age of 2. She did not do anything wrong. She did everything right. She finished high school, against the odds. She developed a talent, against the odds. She was accepted at one of the best music schools in America, and our law very clearly said: Leave; we don't want you. If you want to try to come back in 10 years, that is your business. I don't think that is right. That is why 15 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act. It said: If you are one of those kids brought here under the age of 16, have finished high school, and have no serious criminal issues, we are going to give you a chance. Go to college or join the military and we will give you a path to ultimately getting to the back of the line but becoming a citizen of the United States--the DREAM Act. When I introduced this bill to solve Tereza Lee's problem, I used to give speeches about it all around Chicago. A funny thing would happen. When I would finish the speech and go back to my car, sometimes at night, there would be somebody waiting by my car. As I got closer, it turned out to be a very young girl, usually, maybe with her friend. They would wait to make sure no one was around. The young girl would say to me: Senator, I am one of those DREAMers. I am undocumented. My mom and dad are scared to death that they are going to be deported, and then I will be deported. I hope you can pass this. Well, time passed. We called the bill on the floor and called it in the House. We have never been able to make it the law of the land. Sadly, the reality is that there are probably 2.5 million young people living in America who would qualify under the DREAM Act to be given a chance to become legal--2.5 million. What happened to Tereza Lee? I have to finish that story. She ended up going to the Manhattan School of Music. Two families stepped forward--families that had befriended the Merit music program in Chicago. I know one of them well. They said: This girl is too good. We can't waste her talent. We will pay for her education. They did so out of pocket. She did not qualify for any Federal assistance because she is undocumented. So Tereza finished school and played in Carnegie Hall. Now she is about to complete her Ph.D. in music. She is living in Brooklyn, NY. She is a mom with a little girl. She married an American musician so she is legal--finally. That is her story. Thank goodness this determined young girl stuck with it. We have to stick with it too. The people who want to turn away these 2.5 million DREAMers ought to take a minute to meet them--just to meet them and to understand what it is to be a young person in America going through all the challenges of adolescence and all of the challenges that might be brought to you in your community or by our family and knowing in the back of your mind that at any moment, someone can knock on the door and tell you that you have to leave this country and that you are not here legally. They do it, and they fight every single day for a chance and a dream so that someday they will become part of the only country they have ever known. These are kids who, just like the Senate a few minutes ago, got up every day in the classroom and pledged allegiance to that flag, the only flag they have ever known. They do not view themselves as Mexican or Korean. They view themselves as Americans. The question is this: How do we view them? Do we view them as an asset to America or do we view them as a problem--a problem that should be thrown away and deported? You are listening to the Presidential campaign. We all are. I am not going to go into detail about some of the terrible things that have been said, but I just wish some of the haters, some of the people who want to turn on these young people, would meet them. Come and meet them. Hear their stories. I think even the hardest, coldest heart would be moved by them. Across the street--you can see it through the window--is the Supreme Court building. It was about 12 years ago that we decided to do something in the Senate that I thought was a great idea. Every 2 years, when there is a new class of Senators, we have a dinner with the Justices of the Supreme Court. We do it at their place. It is right across the street. We line up in the entryway there--the beautiful marble entryway. There are tables set up, each of us sits at a table with one of the Justices. I can remember one of the early times I went over there. I shared the table with another Senator, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a legendary Member of the Senate and former President pro tempore of the Senate. He served here for decades and carried the Constitution around in his breast pocket. In his great days he could recite poetry nonstop. He was a real believer in the Senate. He wrote the history of the Senate, one that probably will never be matched. I shared a table with him in the Supreme Court for one of these dinners. I said: Isn't this a beautiful building? He said: It sure is. I said: How often do you get over here, Senator Byrd? He said: This is my first time. I said: You have been in the Senate for 40-plus years, and this is your first time? Why? He said: Well, it is a separate branch of government. We must respect them. They had never asked me to come over. Well, I see it a little differently. I go across that street because, yes, it is a separate branch of government, but it [[Page S2112]] is one that we should understand and respect, as I hope they understand and respect Congress on this side of the street. So this morning I did. I went over for an argument before the Supreme Court. There was a huge mob out in front of the Supreme Court because the case that was being considered is one that affects millions of lives in America--Texas v. United States. The question is this: What are we going to do with people like Tereza Lee, whom I just described earlier. You see, what happened 6 years ago is that I joined with Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and wrote a letter to President Obama saying: If the Congress is not going to change the law to make it possible for these young people to stay in this country, would you issue an Executive order that allows them, at least on a temporary basis, to stay in the United States? Within a year or two, the President agreed to do it. He created what is known as the DACA Program. It basically says that young people like Tereza Lee, whom I described earlier, can step forward, identify themselves to our government, submit themselves for criminal investigation, and pay a filing fee of around $500, I believe it is. If they do, they will be given the right to stay in the United States on a temporary renewable basis for 2 years or 3 years. That is what DACA is all about--so that young people can pursue their lives at least with the understanding that for a few years, they don't have to worry about that knock on the door. Oh, if they get a job, they have to pay their taxes. If they go to college, they are not going to get a penny from this government. We don't help them pay for their college education. The President did it. I applauded him for doing it. So far, 700,000 young people just like Tereza Lee have signed up for protection under DACA. We estimate that the total universe of young people eligible is about 2.5 million. So the President attempted to extend the DACA Program. He said: We need to address the problem with their parents. Many of these parents have children who are U.S. citizens and legally in the United States, but they are undocumented and subject to deportation. So the President said, in what is known as DAPA: The parents of these kids can come forward, submit themselves to a criminal background check with fingerprints and all, pay a filing fee of around $500, and then they will be allowed, on a temporary, renewable basis, if they keep their noses clean, to work in this country. If they are going to work in this country, they have to pay their taxes. Well, that is what the President suggested. As soon as he made these two proposals to extend DACA and to create this other program for the parents, a lawsuit was filed. It was led by the State of Texas, and 25 other States, I believe, joined. That is the case before the Supreme Court today. Before I get into the details of that case--and I want to say a word about it on the floor this afternoon--let me say one other thing. What Senator Byrd told me about not going across the street was not only respect for that institution of the Supreme Court, but as a Senator he was basically saying that we need to respect their right to be above politics. We want to make certain that that branch of government is above politics, that they apply the law and interpret the Constitution in a nonpolitical way. Sometimes I read their decisions and think they have gone political on us. But the goal is to make sure they are preserved from becoming political. This morning, when I went before the Supreme Court, I did not face nine Justices, only eight. Antonin Scalia, who passed away a few weeks ago, created a vacancy that has not been filled. Why has the Senate failed to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court? Because within hours of the untimely death of Justice Scalia, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, who was here a few moments ago, announced publicly: We will not fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court. That is important to remember. It is the first time in the history of the United States of America--the first time in the history of the Senate--that the Senate is refusing a hearing for a Presidential nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has never happened before--never. Oh, the Republicans argue: Well, if the shoe were on the other foot, I am sure you Democrats would do exactly the same thing. I call their attention to the year 1988. Republican President Ronald Reagan, with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, submitted the name of Anthony Kennedy to the Senate. A Republican President was filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and he submitted the name of his nominee. The Senate, then controlled by the Democrats, gave Anthony Kennedy a hearing, a strong vote, and sent him over to the Supreme Court. So when the shoe was on the other foot, we did not play politics. But now we are. So I faced eight Justices over there as that argument was made this morning. I thought to myself: If they end up in a 4-to-4 tie--and that can happen--it will be chaos and confusion across America, with different courts and different districts having different interpretations of the same law. How did we get into this mess? Because the Republican majority in the Senate has decided: We are not going to appoint anyone to fill this vacancy. Their argument is this: Let the American people speak to filling this vacancy in the Presidential election. Let them decide whether it will be a Democrat or a Republican President filling this vacancy. There might be some value to that argument if President Obama, in the last election, when he was running for reelection in 2012, had been running for a term of 3 years. You can argue then that this fourth year he was not entitled to be President. But you know what. It turns out that he was running for a 4-year term. It turns out he won by 5 million votes. It turns out that when it comes to being Commander in Chief and President of the United States, he has all the powers vested in him by the Constitution, even in the fourth year. Isn't that amazing--4 years as the President? That is what the American people decided, but only to be overruled by the Republican majority in the Senate. Sorry, Mr. President, they say, you only get 3 years. Maybe we give you 3 years and 2 months, but you sure don't have the right to try and fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, even though the Constitution explicitly says in article II, section 2: The President shall appoint a nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Their argument is that you may think you are President when it comes to the Supreme Court, but the Senate Republican majority thinks otherwise. I sat down with Merrick Garland. He is the proposed nominee to fill this vacancy. He is chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, which is a high position in the judiciary. He was born in Illinois, so I come to his nomination with some prejudice, but he is an extraordinary person. People have said: Well, why didn't the President choose a woman? Why didn't the President choose an African American? Why didn't he choose a Hispanic? Why didn't he choose someone from India? Why did he choose this man? I think he chose him for an obvious reason: He is clearly qualified. Even Republican Senators have said nice things about him publicly. Many of them have said they refuse to even meet with him, will not even sit in the same room with him. Some have agreed to, but many have said no. Senator McConnell said: I won't meet with him because he is not going to get a hearing and he is not going to get a vote. It is time for us to fill that vacancy. It is time for us to accept our constitutional responsibility and show respect for the document we all swore to uphold and defend when we took the oath of office. It is time to fill that vacancy and put nine Justices on the Supreme Court to avoid the uncertainty, confusion, and chaos which might otherwise emerge. I wish to say a word about the case before the Court this morning. This was a case--United States v. Texas--a legal challenge, as I mentioned earlier, to the President's immigration policy, filed by 26 Republican Governors. I believe this lawsuit has no legal merit. It is driven by political hostility toward President Obama and his immigration policy. I was proud to join an amicus brief signed by 39 Senators on our side of the aisle and 186 House Democrats in support of the administration's decision [[Page S2113]] on immigration. The President is on very solid ground in this case. I am hoping and confident that the Supreme Court will rule in his favor. As an initial matter before the case proceeds, the States that filed this lawsuit have to show they will be harmed by the President's immigration policy. Otherwise, they really don't have any standing to sue. It turns out that exactly the opposite is true. The President's policy allowing people to work here on a temporary basis under his Executive orders will create a huge benefit to the American economy. Over the next 10 years, in the State of Texas alone--and they brought the lawsuit; at least started it--the President's immigration action would increase that State's gross domestic product by more than $38 billion and increase the earnings of all Texas residents by $17.5 billion. They argue that the President's immigration policy would cost the State of Texas money. It turns out that exactly the opposite is true. Even if the States have standing to sue, the Supreme Court repeatedly has held that the Federal Government has broad authority to decide questions of immigration. Justice Anthony Kennedy, appointed earlier, wrote the opinion for the Court striking down Arizona's controversial immigration law. Listen to what he said: A principal feature of the removal system-- Removal of people who are not eligible to be in the United States-- is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials. . . . Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime. This administration's immigration policy is not just legal, it is smart and realistic. The President has said simply: We should prioritize. We have limited resources. We can't deport all those who are here undocumented. If we are only going to deport some, let's pick those who are a danger to the United States. The President has focused on those who have been convicted of serious crimes or pose a threat to our security. And shouldn't he? As Commander in Chief, shouldn't that be his highest priority, to make sure anyone who is a danger to the United States is gone? He knows he can't deport all even if he wished to, so he focuses on those who may be a danger to the United States--prosecutorial discretion. The Department of Homeland Security only has enough funding to deport a small fraction of undocumented, so the President wants to focus the limited resources on those who could do us harm. That is just common sense. At the same time, the President said that we should not waste our resources on deporting young immigrant students who grow up in this country, such as Tereza Lee, whom I mentioned earlier, or tear apart families by deporting the parents of U.S. citizens. The President's policy is focused on deporting felons, not families--criminals, not children. In November of 2014, President Obama established this program, DAPA, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents. Under DAPA, undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for more than 5 years and have American children would be required to come forward, register with the government, pay a fee, go through a criminal background check and a national security background check, and pay their taxes. If the government determines these parents have not committed any serious crimes and don't pose any threat, this Executive order says: On a temporary, renewable basis, they will not be targeted for deportation. President Obama also expanded the DACA Program for children, as I mentioned earlier, at the same time. Why did he do that? Because for years Republicans in Congress have refused to consider legislation to fix our broken immigration system. On the floor of the Senate on June 27, 2013, I joined a group of seven other Senators--four Democrats and four Republicans in total. We had worked for months to construct a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill. We had to give a lot. There were things in that bill which I didn't like at all and things which some of the Republican Senators didn't like, but it is the nature of legislation and compromise that that happens. We brought the bill to the floor for a vote after a lengthy markup in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and dozens of amendments had been offered. The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation on June 27, 2013, 68 to 32--more than 2 to 1. That bill would have strengthened border security, protected American workers, and established a tough but fair path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who were then currently living in our country. What happened to the bill after it passed the Senate? I take you back to how laws are made and your civics course. It went across the Rotunda to the House of Representatives, which was under Republican control. The majority in the House of Representatives refused to call the bill, refused to even bring it to the floor for a debate, and refused to offer any substitute. They did nothing--nothing, despite our broken immigration system. In the face of this, the President was left with no choice. For the good of the American people, he used the authority given him as President to try to make some reforms to our immigration system. The Center for American Progress has studied what the President proposed, and they say that over the next 10 years, if these two programs--DACA and DAPA--were passed, the gross domestic product for my home State of Illinois would increase by $15 billion and the earnings of Illinois residents would increase by almost $8 billion. Could your State use that--more economic activity, more people paying taxes to the Federal Government and to your State? Virtually every State could use that. It is unfortunate that these bills have been blocked by the Senate, and now they are trying to block them in the Supreme Court. I see Senator Cornyn is on the floor, and I will close by telling a story about another DREAMer. I have done this quite a few times. My staff has done a lot of work on it. I thank them all for it. These stories really say a lot more than I ever could in a speech. They tell us what was at stake before the Supreme Court of the United States this morning. This attractive young woman is Vasthy Lamadrid. Her family came to the United States from Mexico. She was 5 years old. They came here with nothing. They moved into a home with four other families, so a lot of the kids slept in the same room. Despite their poverty, Vasthy felt safe and excelled in school. Math was her best subject. She had nearly perfect scores on standardized tests. English was tough, but then she discovered a series of books called ``Goosebumps.'' If you have kids or grandkids, I bet you have heard of that one. She became an avid reader and mastered the English language. By middle school, Vasthy was placed in the gifted program. That is where she discovered her love of engineering. She was a student in the Engineering Pathway at Bioscience High School, where she received the Young Entrepreneurs Award, made the principal's list every semester, and played tennis. She was an active volunteer, working with such groups as Girls For Change, CompuGirls, E-Tech, Hospice of the Valley, and St. Joseph's Hospital. Vasthy also helped younger kids in her neighborhood by tutoring them in math and tennis. Vasthy went on to attend Arizona State University. Because she is undocumented, she didn't qualify for a penny of government assistance, and she had to pay out-of-State tuition despite the fact that she had lived her entire life in the United States, in Arizona. Then something extraordinary happened. Counting on the generosity of the American people, Vasthy decided to crowdfund her college education. She shared her life story online and asked people to contribute to help her pay her tuition. Well, it worked. She is currently in her second year of college. In the first semester, she made the dean's list with a 3.79 GPA in the Ira Fulton School of Engineering. Thanks to DACA--the Presidential Executive order--she is able to support herself. She has also made time to continue to volunteer for a club called [[Page S2114]] STEM Academy mentoring young children. She volunteers with the Arizona Immigration Refugee Service as an English teacher. As a result of her volunteer work, she has decided she wants to become a science teacher. Can we use more science teachers in America? You bet. This is what she said in a letter she wrote: DACA signifies to me a chance to show that I belong here-- that inside I am an American. It represents an opportunity to show that my parents' sacrifice was worth it. I love this country and want to one day become a citizen and continue to give back to the community. I don't need that journey to become a citizen to be easily given to me, but I'd hope that the journey is fair. Vasthy and other DREAMers have so much they can give to America. I don't understand the Republican Party when it comes to the issue of immigration. We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country. I am a first-generation American and proud of it. It is my honor to serve and represent a great State like Illinois. I know what her journey was like. She was brought here at the age of 2 from Lithuania. I know what her early life was like as she struggled to try to make sure there was food on the table, first for her mom, sister, and brother, and then ultimately for her own family. That is my family's story, but it is a story that is repeated over and over again. There is something in the DNA of immigrants who are willing to risk everything in this world to go to a country where they don't even speak the language because they know they will have an opportunity here, and they bring something with them. That is why they light up the scoreboard in Silicon Valley with all of these new inventions and new corporations with thousands of employees that make us an economic success in many fields. That is why we should think twice about those who condemn immigrants in this Nation of immigrants. I am confident the Supreme Court will uphold the President's immigration actions. Then I hope, after they have done this, that the Republicans in Congress will finally decide to return to the table and work on a bipartisan basis for comprehensive immigration reform. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip is recognized. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am always impressed with the distinguished Democratic whip and his eloquence, but he is telling the American people that we have to choose between being a nation of immigrants or a nation of laws. The fact is, we don't have to make that choice; we can be both. But we can't do it when we have a President who simply believes he can do an end run around the U.S. Constitution. In fact, according to Pew, about 3.5 million people could claim the benefits of the President's unlawful Executive action, receiving work permits, driver's licenses, and Social Security numbers. While we are a compassionate country, we are a nation of immigrants, that is not the kind of decision the Constitution gives to a single political actor, even if he is the President of the United States. So there is a right way and a wrong way. And I realize the distinguished Democratic whip believes that just because they can't get what they want when they want it, the President can then resort to this end run, but thankfully that is not the view of the courts. The U.S. Federal district court in Brownsville, TX, issued an injunction against the President's Executive action. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that injunction, and now the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments in the case this afternoon. This is really more than just about immigration. This is whether, under the doctrine of separation of powers, the Constitution we have lived under for lo these many years gives the President unilateral authority without the approval of Congress, the elected representatives of the people, and in flagrant disregard for the laws that are already on the books. The heart of the case the Court heard today is about stopping a President who said: I have a pen and I have a phone. And even though the American people have given Republicans a majority in both Houses and obviously forced the President to deal with a Republican conference to come up with consensus legislation, the President said: Forget that. I am not about trying to achieve bipartisan consensus on anything. If I don't get what I want, I am going to jam it through the system and hope the courts don't stop me. So it is not just about immigration, it is about the Constitution itself. There are perhaps 22 different times, by my count, where the President of the United States acknowledged he didn't even have this authority. I remember in a speech he gave to La Raza, an interview he gave on Univision, the President denied he had the authority, which now, miraculously, our Democratic friends think is clear-cut under the law. How can that be? It cannot be. I remember specifically being at a meeting where the President invited the leadership of both the House and the Senate to the White House after the 2014 election. Many may recall that leading up to that point, there had been a lot of rumors about the President issuing an Executive action, but he had not done so. I remember specifically sitting there in the White House with some of my colleagues from the House and the Senate, where then-Speaker Boehner said to the President: Please, Mr. President, don't do this. Don't poison the well. Don't make it impossible, by such a polarizing action, for us to build consensus on the building blocks of immigration reform where we could actually agree. I remember Majority Leader McCarthy making the same comment. I joined in and reiterated the same point. The President, defiant, told us he was going to go ahead and do it. There are a lot of conversations people are having today across the United States. I had some of those earlier today during some visits with people who were just wondering how to explain the political environment in America today. What I tell them is that this seems unprecedented in my experience. People are so angry. People are so scared. People are frightened and worried about the next generation. And for the first time in my memory, parents are doubting whether their children will enjoy the same sorts of freedom and prosperity that we enjoy today. That is a tragedy. My parents were part of the ``greatest generation.'' My dad was a B- 17 pilot in the Army Air Corps, even before the Air Force came into being. On his 26th bombing mission over Nazi Germany, while he was flying in the 8th Air Force out of Molesworth, England, he was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war for 4 months. Fortunately, that was toward the tail end of the war. Even though he was injured in his parachute jump--not seriously, as it turned out, although he had some disability associated with that later in life--he managed to survive that and even survived an appendectomy by a fellow prisoner of war when he had appendicitis in a POW camp. It is amazing. I always thought my dad had nine lives. Even though he passed away at the very young age of 67, he survived countless occasions when surely he could have lost his life, including those occasions of jumping out of a burning B-17 plane over Germany and an appendectomy in a POW camp at the hands of a fellow prisoner of war. The reason my parents and all of our parents sacrificed so much and risked so much and worked so hard is that they believed in the promise of America--the promise that exists only when the law is respected, when people in high office are bound by and obligated to and held accountable to the same laws that govern the most humble among us. That is what America is all about--a country where people, if they work hard and play by the rules, can achieve their dreams. I think that is the reason America seems so polarized today. People have sort of jumped outside the usual paradigm of political calculation where you are a liberal or you are a conservative or you are somewhere in the middle. People have sort of jumped that track, and we are seeing something entirely different on the left and on the right. I think the reason is, in part, because of a President who believes he is not bound by the Constitution and laws of the United States. People are frightened because they have seen over the last 7 years-- even though the President was stopped legislatively after the Affordable Care Act [[Page S2115]] was passed and after Dodd-Frank was passed and then stopped by the electorate giving the Republicans a majority in the House and in 2014 a majority in Senate--that this President will not be stopped by the voters. That is the determination he made, and this Executive order is exhibit 1 because he said: I don't care what the voters think. I don't care what the American people think. I don't care what the Constitution says. I don't care that what Congress says should be the law of the land. I am going to do it the way I want to do it. Frankly, that is scary stuff when you are talking about the Commander in Chief, the leader of the free world, and the sort of power that goes along with that. Rather than heed the warning--or I would really call it the plea of leaders in the House and the Senate after the 2014 election--the President decided to go around Congress and try to essentially change the law, giving work permits to people who were illegally present in the country, giving them driver's licenses, even giving Social Security numbers to an estimated 3.5 million people. How can the President do this when Congress is deadlocked? Well, he did it. And that is a question the Supreme Court is going to have to decide. At the time, the President called it a middle-ground approach. He is a master of rhetoric. The problem is the facts belie his words. The fact of the matter is this was a constitutional scorched-earth tactic. And more than anything else, it eroded public confidence in Congress's ability, working with the White House, to get anything constructive done in the area of immigration. The Acting President pro tempore is, of course, from the great State of Oklahoma, and he went to school in Texas. He understands what I understand: We have a large Hispanic population in Texas--about 38 percent. But we are a very diverse State. Many people are surprised when I tell them the third most commonly spoken language in Texas today is Vietnamese--Vietnamese. Can you believe that? We also have a large Indian American population. We are a very diverse State, and the main reason for that is we still represent that land of opportunity that America used to be, where people can come, work hard--those of modest means, with little on their backs and maybe nothing in their pockets--and achieve something and live the American dream. So I resent, I really do resent, the distinguished Senator from Illinois trying to tell us the President was only trying to do something that was good for Texas. He doesn't have a clue. In fact, if we were to follow the policy choices of the leadership in Texas, the country would be a heck of a lot better off when it comes to taking advantage of our energy resources, when it comes to taxes, reasonable regulation, and a willingness to try to accommodate those who invest capital and create jobs. To me, that is the single biggest difference between where I live in Texas and what I see across our country and what is coming out of Washington, DC. There seems to be an attitude here in Washington of how many more obstacles, how many larger impediments can we place in the way of those who invest the capital and those who are creating the jobs and still expect the American dream to be alive. Believe me, we have tested it. The Obama administration has tested it, and what it has produced is disaster. It has produced a health care system that, rather than making health care more affordable, has made it more expensive, has caused people who liked their coverage to give up their coverage only to buy something that had a deductible that has, in essence, made them self-insured. It has created stagnant wages. It has created stagnant economic growth. There are not a lot of problems we have in this country that couldn't be mitigated, made better, if we just saw our economy growing again, instead of the sort of anemic and flatlined growth we have seen since 2008. My predecessor in the Senate, Mr. Phil Gramm, has a Ph.D. in economics from Texas A&M University. He has made the point that, historically, what you see after a recession like the one we saw following the fiscal crisis in 2008 is a V-shape recovery. In other words, you hit the bottom and you bounce up and you grow quickly because basically you have worked the problems out of the system. But what we have seen since 2008 is a U-shaped recovery, if you could even call it that. It is pretty close to flat, where the economy is growing at less than 2 percent, which is not fast enough to keep people fully employed. And we still have--although the unemployment rate has dropped down, we still have the smallest percentage of people participating in the workforce that we have had in the last 30 years. Many people have simply given up, retired early, or made other arrangements. This is a serious matter. The Supreme Court heard arguments today. We know there are currently eight members of the Supreme Court. I heard the distinguished Democratic whip complain about the fact that we have decided to allow the voters to choose in November the President who will make the choice to fill the Scalia vacancy. Well, the fact of the matter is, it is simply too important to allow President Obama, given his penchant for lawlessness and usurpation of constitutional authority--to give him the chance to stack the Supreme Court in favor of a Court that would likely rubberstamp his actions and those of future Presidents for the next 25 years. The hypocrisy is rich, listening to our Democratic colleagues. These are the folks who invented the judicial filibuster. They invented the judicial filibuster. They did that when President George W. Bush was President. As controversial as the nomination of Clarence Thomas was, I believe he was confirmed with 52 votes--not 60 votes but 52 because nobody dreamed back then that Senate rules would allow the minority party to insist on 60 votes to confirm a President's appointee. We know that after the election where the Democratic majority lost that majority, in a lameduck session they jammed a number of appointees onto the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in an effort to pack that court to match the ideological picture they wanted. Again, this is the second most important court in the Nation, which they believed would be more inclined to rubberstamp the overreaching by the Obama administration. We are all familiar with the Biden speech in 1992 when, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he suggested it would be perhaps inappropriate to confirm a Presidential nominee in the waning days of that President's term. We saw the Harry Reid speech in 2005, where he said it is the President's prerogative to appoint, but the Senate is not obligated to grant consent to that nomination. Actually, I agree with Senator Reid back then, but not today, when he has taken the exact opposite approach. Then there is Senator Schumer, the heir apparent to the Democratic leadership in the Senate, who said, in 2007, 18 months before George W. Bush left office: I think there ought to be a presumption against confirmation. To listen to my Democratic colleagues complain about the decision we have made to let the voters vote for the President who is going to fill that vacancy and to watch them--well, it looks like crocodile tears to me, and it smells like hypocrisy. As we have said, the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments today in a case brought by the State of Texas and other States that would otherwise be compelled to grant work permits, issue driver's licenses and Social Security numbers to people illegally present in the United States who did not comply with our laws. I am confident the Court will find that the States have suffered real harm from the standpoint of the constitutional notion of standing; in other words, you have to have standing before you can sue. Basically, it means you have to show real or potential harm if the Court doesn't act. I am confident the Court will find standing. But the Court will do one of two things. Either the Court will affirm by being split 4 to 4 or all eight Justices could write in favor of the Fifth Circuit decision to let the injunction stand or, if the Court deems that this issue needs to be held over until the Court has all nine members, after the first of the year, that is a decision the Court can make. This is a very important issue, and I am glad the Court is taking it up. We [[Page S2116]] need to know--we need to know whether we remain a nation of laws as well as a nation of immigrants. The whole idea our Democratic colleagues have foisted on us that somehow we have to choose between those two is a false choice. It is a false choice. We are both. We aren't one or the other. America has always been made better by people who have risked coming to the United States because they weren't satisfied with what they had or where they lived, but the day we begin rewarding people who do this in disregard of the laws is the day we begin to no longer be a nation of laws, and that is a legacy and a treasure we should not squander. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Nebraska. Tax Reform Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to discuss an issue of importance for Nebraskans and Americans all across this country; that is, the need for comprehensive tax reform. It is no secret the current Tax Code is overly complex and outdated. Any American can tell you how frustrating it is to file a tax return. Our Tax Code is riddled with deductions, exemptions, credits, exclusions, preferences, and loopholes that make it nearly impossible for anyone without a degree in tax law to understand. At the same time, we should recognize that some progress has been made. Thanks to the work of Chairman Hatch and members of the Senate Finance Committee, many important updates to the Tax Code were made permanent at the end of last year. In particular, increasing the deduction limit and making permanent section 179 of the Tax Code was an important step. This section allows small businesses to deduct from their taxes certain depreciable business assets. My constituents told me annual uncertainty about whether section 179 would be renewed made it very difficult for them to plan, to invest, and to grow their businesses. Making this provision permanent reduced the ambiguity that had plagued Nebraska's small business owners and operators. Although we have made some progress in reforming the Tax Code, there is more work to do for the American people. I believe tax reform should focus on several principles, including competitiveness, simplicity, and economic growth. At nearly 40 percent, the United States has the highest combined corporate tax rate in the developed world. This is stifling job growth, hurting families, and compelling businesses to move overseas. Any comprehensive plan should seek to lower this rate to a competitive level, one that will not only encourage current businesses to stay but also incentivize new businesses to set up shop. Another goal of comprehensive tax reform should be to simplify the Tax Code. Families and businesses spend billions of hours every year in completing their taxes. A disproportionate share of this burden is shouldered by many small businesses. Many of these are family businesses, and they don't have the resources to easily comply. Creating a tax system that is simple and efficient will reduce administrative and compliance costs. A simple tax system will also increase transparency, allowing Americans to fill out their taxes accurately while preventing fraud and lost revenue. Perhaps most importantly, any plan to reform the Tax Code--well, it must spur economic growth. Inaction on reforming the Tax Code is delaying needed growth in GDP, jobs, and investment. When I was first elected to the Senate, I thought my colleagues and I would immediately take up two issues to restart our economy, grow jobs, and help all American families: tax reform and reducing the overburden of government regulations. After all, it is pretty obvious these are two issues we can reform that would have a positive impact on our economy. We see regulations become ever more burdensome, and they continue to depress our economy, stifle innovation, and hurt our families. Major tax reform has not happened. We continue to chip away, but I believe now is the time we step up and be bolder. We must make the necessary reforms to our tax system to give Americans confidence in our future. We need to help put more money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans and allow them to spend money on the goods and services they choose and that they need. It is my hope my colleagues will join me in continuing this discussion and that this dialogue then will eventually result in action, in comprehensive tax reform that truly benefits Nebraskans and the American people. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. China's Aluminum Industry Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, over the last few decades, China has used market-distorting subsidies and industrial policies to repeatedly prop up their own industries and rip off American jobs. Steel, tires, solar panels--the story plays out again and again. Too often China's economy is not run by the markets; it is run by government committee. So even though its own State Council has called out the problem of severe excess capacities, China clings to the same old tired and destructive policies. Today I want to address what is happening now with China's huge overcapacity of aluminum. The amount of aluminum Chinese smelters are churning out has gone up by more than 1,200 percent in a decade and a half. In 2000, they produced 2.5 million metric tons. In 2015 China produced 32 million metric tons. When you create a glut of aluminum production the way China has, you send the markets into turmoil and you do enormous harm to American workers. I spoke last week at a public hearing held by the U.S. Trade Representative and the International Trade Commission about how the overproduction of steel in China is an urgent and immediate threat to steel jobs here in our country. While China's steel mills are churning out more steel than ever, American steel towns are suffering or worse. Thousands of jobs nationwide have been lost just in the last year. Even though one-third of all steel produced today has no buyer, China keeps adding and adding to the glut by producing more steel. The same story is played out in the case of primary aluminum. There is a huge overcapacity in China that, once again, is driven by market- distorting government policies. It has unleashed a chain of events that can end in economic devastation across this country. Global aluminum prices have already plummeted, undercutting our American companies. Between the start of 2011 and this upcoming June, the lights will have gone out at nearly two-thirds of the aluminum smelters in the United States. More than 6,500 jobs--good American jobs--will have been lost. You can bet that sooner or later the damage will ripple downstream through the entire aluminum industry, which employs three-quarters of a million Americans either directly or indirectly. In my judgment, the United States is badly in need of a safeguard against this economic tidal wave. That is why I have chosen to stand with my friend Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, and the steelworkers. They filed a petition for relief under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 today. Without an immediate economic bulwark, the United States is in danger of losing thousands of good family-wage jobs across our country. It is my view that the administration should act in this case as soon as possible to defend our workers and our businesses from economic ruin. The United States and our trading partners must ramp up the pressure on China to stop overproduction, and our trade enforcers have to take on the trade cheats and use every single trade tool in the toolbox, including the ENFORCE Act, the Leveling the Playing Field Act, and the other measures my colleagues and I on the Finance Committee fought to get signed into law over the last year. I firmly believe workers in Oregon and across this country can compete with anybody in the world, but the United States cannot afford to sit idly by and watch China's destructive policies cause our aluminum industry to be wiped out. As the steelworkers have pointed out repeatedly, enough is [[Page S2117]] enough. Leo Gerard and those steelworkers are standing up and fighting back, and I am honored to stand with them. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in a few moments, we will be voting on ending debate on H.R. 636, and that will allow us to proceed to a vote on the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016. I wish to urge my colleagues to support that motion to end debate. The legislation we are considering is not just any FAA reauthorization. This bill is the most pro-passenger and pro-security FAA reauthorization in recent history. Travelers are frustrated, and this bill contains commonsense reforms to make travel safe and secure and more passenger-friendly. For over 2 weeks on the Senate floor now and before that in the Commerce Committee, where I serve as chairman, we have been working hard to thoughtfully develop this bill and to allow for robust debate. For instance, there are drone safety provisions in the bill, including a pilot program to deploy technology to intercept drones near airports. These provisions are obviously intended to prevent accidents like the one that happened outside the Heathrow Airport this weekend, where a drone hit an approaching plane. We developed this provision and others in the bill through an open process that allowed every member of the committee to contribute and help write the bill. Last year, we held six hearings on topics that helped inform our bill, and at the committee markup last month alone, we accepted 57 amendments, 34 of which were sponsored by Democrats and 23 by Republicans. On the Senate floor, when it was reported out and taken up, we added 19 amendments, 10 from Democrats and 9 from Republican Senators. The resulting bill is one we can be proud of, and both sides of the aisle have commended us for our inclusive process. When there have been differences, we have been able to find ways to address or set those aside for later so the progress on the legislation could move forward. Even at this late hour, we have worked constructively to assemble a possible managers' package of more than two dozen additional amendments that we would like to adopt by voice vote prior to final passage. Yet, even if that is not possible, I commit to those Senators whose amendments we stand prepared to accept that I will work to address their concerns as we engage with our colleagues in the House of Representatives. Now it is time to conclude our work on the bipartisan FAA bill that I introduced a long ways back, along with my friend and ranking member, Senator Bill Nelson, and our Aviation Subcommittee leaders, Senators Kelly Ayotte and Maria Cantwell. The bill includes reforms benefiting the traveling public, and we shouldn't let them down. Let's vote yes on the motion to end debate and start moving these historic reforms forward. As I mentioned, I have a list of 26 amendments that we would like to clear--amendments offered by both sides. It is a package we could adopt. We have a couple of objections to doing that. If the Members who have put forward those objections would be willing to release those objections, we would be able to get another 26 amendments adopted, many of which have been offered by colleagues, as I said, on both sides and many of which contain measures that I think will make the bill even stronger and make it a product we can all be proud of as it moves over to the House of Representatives. There, I hope it will receive consideration and action and ultimately end up on the President's desk. The FAA bill is legislation we have to do on a fairly routine basis around here. This authorization will stand for about 18 months. There are a number of important considerations that need to be addressed that this bill not only acknowledges but addresses. As I mentioned, those considerations have to do with drone safety, which is an increasingly important issue in our economy and one where we need to make sure we have the right rules of the air, if you will, in place so that we preserve and ensure that safety is the No. 1 factor as we continue to see the increased research, development, and deployment of drone technologies in ways that have tremendous commercial application. As I said, it also includes a lot of passenger protections which are very consumer-friendly in terms of passengers who travel on a regular basis with the airlines. So those are things as well that we need to address in this legislation. We enhanced the bill by amendment when it came to the floor with a couple of safety provisions that we think are critically important, particularly in light of what has happened of late with the attack in Brussels and a number of other attacks we have seen, where we have had aviation insiders involved, if you will--particularly the Metrojet airliner that crashed not that long ago and killed 224 people. There are a number of safety provisions that help address some of those concerns. As I said, we expand the TSA precheck program to limit the number of people who are in areas outside secure areas--outside the perimeter, so to speak--where they are more vulnerable to these types of attacks. These are all included in this legislation. So from an aviation security standpoint, this bill includes the most comprehensive security measures we will have adopted in nearly a decade. As I said before, from a passenger-friendly standpoint, according to a columnist at the Washington Post, this is one of the most passenger-friendly FAA reauthorization bills we have seen literally in a generation. So these are reasons why this bill needs to move forward. I hope my colleagues here in the Senate, when the vote comes here in a few minutes, will cast a vote in support of ending debate and allow us to move forward to a vote on final passage, which will enable this legislation to move forward to the House of Representatives and I hope ultimately to the President so he can sign it into law and put many of these provisions in place that would be good for our country. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Immigration Enforcement Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today, I wish to pay tribute to Sarah Root, a young woman from Iowa who just graduated from college with perfect grades. She was devoted to her family and friends and had a bright future, but she was taken from this earth too soon. I want to express my sympathies to Sarah's parents and acknowledge Michelle Root, Sarah's mother, who is watching today. She will be testifying tomorrow before the House Committee on the Judiciary at a hearing titled, ``The Real Victims of a Reckless and Lawless Immigration Policy: Families and Survivors Speak Out on the Real Cost of This Administration's Policies.'' The hearing will focus on how the Obama administration's failed immigration policies allow thousands of criminal aliens to roam free. Michelle Root will share her personal story about the loss of her daughter and how someone in the country illegally was able to walk free and abscond from authorities after fatally hitting her daughter's vehicle on graduation night. Sarah was 21 years old and had just graduated from Bellevue University with an interest in pursuing a career in criminal justice. In the words of her family, ``she was full of life and ready to take on the world.'' According to a close friend of hers, Sarah was smart, outgoing, and dedicated to her friends and family. She embodied the words: ``live, laugh, love.'' The day Sarah graduated, she was struck by a drunk driver in the country illegally. The alleged drunk driver was Edwin Mejia, who had a blood alcohol [[Page S2118]] content of more than three times the legal limit. The driver was charged with felony motor vehicle homicide and operating a vehicle while intoxicated on February 3. Bail was set at $50,000, but he was only required to put up 10 percent. So, for a mere $5,000, the drunk driver walked out of jail and into the shadows. This case has shed light on the breakdown between the Federal Government and State and locals. It has also been a terrible example of why the President's policies don't work, and how they are having a dire effect on American families like the Root family. Under President Obama's Priority Enforcement Program, a person in the country illegally will only be detained or removed in a few limited circumstances. The administration hides behind these so-called ``priorities'' to ensure that a vast majority of people in the country are not removed. Some say that nearly 90,000 illegal immigrant criminals were released in 2015 because of this policy. The administration's polices result in tragedies like Sarah's. A smart young lady who had a bright future was struck by a drunk driver who entered the country illegally, and was turned over to a brother who was also in the country illegally, while awaiting his immigration court date. After the accident, local law enforcement apparently asked the Federal government--specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement--to take custody of the driver, but the Federal government declined. ICE refused to place a detainer on him. An ICE spokesman stated that the agency did not lodge a detainer on the man because his arrest for felony motor vehicle homicide ``did not meet ICE's enforcement priorities.'' The driver made bond and absconded, never showing up for his hearings and required drug tests. It is difficult for the family to have closure since the man is nowhere to be found. It is unknown if he is still in the United States or if he has fled to his home country of Honduras. Sarah Root is one of many victims who have been harmed or killed because of lax immigration enforcement and the notion that drunk driving isn't always a public safety threat. Even though this tragic accident happened in the heartland of America, this is a border security problem. The driver of the vehicle that killed Sarah entered the country illegally. Every day, people are illegally entering the country, being removed, entering again, and committing more crimes. Illegal re-entries are happening because there are no consequences. That is what happened in Kate Steinle's death. And, that is why we need to move on Kate's law. That bill would deter people from illegally re-entering by enhancing penalties and establishing new mandatory minimum sentences for certain individuals with previous felony convictions. The Obama administration cannot continue to turn a blind eye to drunk drivers, sanctuary communities, and people who ignore our laws, overstay their visas, or cross the border time and again. I am still waiting for answers from the Obama administration on this case, and many more. There are many unanswered questions. How many more people have to die? How many more women and young people are going to be taken from their family and friends? Things have got to change. The President must rethink his policies and must find a way to ensure that criminal immigrants are taken off the streets. The Obama administration should try enforcing the law, instead of its priorities, for the sake of the American people. I want to wish Michelle Root the best of luck while she is in Washington this week, and send my thoughts to her father who is trying to find justice back home. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Ohio. Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the sentiments shared by our senior Senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley. Tomorrow morning, one of my constituents, Michelle Root, will be testifying before the House Judiciary Committee about the loss of her beautiful young daughter, Sarah Root. As a mother of three daughters myself, I cannot begin to fathom the pain and anguish Mrs. Root is experiencing. Earlier this year, 21-year-old Sarah Root was killed by a drunk driver. That driver, Edwin Mejia, was allegedly drag racing with a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit when he crashed into the back of Sarah's vehicle. Edwin Mejia is also an illegal immigrant. After causing the death of an American citizen and being charged with motor vehicle homicide, one would think he would clearly meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's so-called enforcement priorities. But no, citing the administration's November 2014 memo on immigration enforcement priorities, ICE declined to lodge a detainer and take custody of Mejia. During a recent Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, ICE Director Sarah Saldana actually suggested that ICE neglected to issue a detainer because at the time they were contacted, Sarah Root was seriously injured, not dead. How twisted and convoluted has our immigration system become that an illegal immigrant who, while driving drunk and drag racing, hits and either seriously injures or kills an American citizen is not considered a priority for deportation? In fact, only after a floor speech, multiple letters, and hearing questions from Senators from Nebraska and Iowa, as well as media attention and concerns raised by the Root family, did ICE finally acknowledge that they should have taken Mejia into custody. It should not take all of those actions for ICE to determine that an illegal immigrant who kills an American citizen should be removed from our country. Tragically, after ICE declined to file a detainer against Mejia, he posted a $5,000 bond, was released, and has since disappeared. This is so despite the fact that he had a history of skipping court dates related to prior driving offenses. A few weeks ago, I spoke with Sarah's dad, who told me that before they could even lay their daughter to rest, Mejia was released. This is truly an injustice, and we must do everything we can to ensure that we get answers in this case and prevent a similar tragedy from being replicated elsewhere. While America has been and always will be a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. It is a privilege to live in this country, and anyone who comes here illegally and harms our citizens should without question constitute a priority for removal. For ICE to decide otherwise is baffling. In recognition of their clear mistake, they have since listed Mejia on their ``most wanted'' list and acknowledged they should have taken him into custody. The photograph of Sarah behind me was taken as she celebrated her graduation from Bellevue University with a 4.0 GPA and a bachelor's degree in criminal investigations and prepared to begin a bright future. The next day, she was killed. While nothing can bring Sarah back, her family and friends deserve clear answers as to why Mejia was allowed to flee. This tragedy further underscores the administration's failed immigration enforcement priorities and should serve to spur renewed discussion about their so- called priorities. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, there are a lot of people in this country who work very, very hard. We are known in this country as a people who work hard. Montanans are no exception. We have some of the hardest working folks I know who live in that great State. Whether it is a farmer preparing the spring crop or a fishing guide preparing for the upcoming tourist season, my constituents know what a long day's work looks like. In fact, many of my constituents work two jobs so they can put food on the table and a roof over their head and can save for their kid's college education. These folks don't wake up in the morning and say: Hey, I think I will take the year off and just sit it out. [[Page S2119]] That is why it is no surprise that when I went home for the March recess, Montanans were overwhelmingly disgusted with the majority's decision to refuse to do their job. Constituent after constituent asked me what the heck we were doing back here. Local editorial boards even chimed in. The Billings Gazette, my State's largest newspaper, tore the majority to shreds, saying that those who crow about making Washington work better are intentionally sabotaging the system, making it work worse. The Montana Standard, in ``Butte, America,'' accused Senators of ``shirking their constitutional responsibilities'' and denounced their tactics as ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.'' If that wasn't enough, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle described the crusade as ``nothing but an abdication of responsibility and another example of the kind of playground-level obstruction that has soured so many Americans on Congress and contributed to the divisive meltdown in the race to the GOP nomination for President.'' Now here we are. It has been 33 days since Judge Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court--33 days and counting. Yet there are no hearings in sight, no chance for the American people to have their voices heard through their elected representatives, no chance to ask tough questions of the nominee. This week we will hear the majority leader talk about regular order with respect to appropriations bills. But if regular order is good enough for appropriations bills, it is good enough for a Supreme Court nomination. The bottom line is this. The American people are as frustrated as I am. They are fed up with the obstructionism, and they want Congress to do its job. So let's have a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and then let's have a vote in the Senate. As the Montana Standard says, anything less than that is ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.'' I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in about 8 minutes we are going to start the vote on a motion for cloture, moving forward on the FAA bill. We have had a lot of debate about this. It passed with very little objection in the Commerce Committee. We have a package of 26 amendments, all of which have been cleared. We hope that can go as a separate amendment, almost like a managers' package. They are all noncontroversial. I am quite encouraged that we are making a number of reforms in the FAA that I have spoken about at length and that the chairman of the committee, Senator Thune, has spoken about at length. It is a good bill. Its previous adoption on a motion for cloture was something like 94 to 4. So you see where we are going. Then we will get into conference with the House, although it is my understanding they have not passed their bill. They passed it out of committee, but they have some controversial things. Hopefully, they will get it out, and we will be able to come to terms and get this reauthorization of the FAA, which we had to extend in a short-term reauthorization, because the clock is ticking. So I just wanted to share that with the Senate. Protecting the Manatee Now, Mr. President, since we have some time and no Senator is seeking recognition, I want to tell the Presiding Officer about a creature we have in Florida. We have lots of interesting creatures. There are things that come in that are like alien species, such as the Burmese python that they estimate--the Superintendent of Everglades National Park has estimated that there may be as many as 150,000. They got one 15-foot female, and she had 54 eggs in her. So you see how prolific they are. You cannot find them. The only way you can really find them is if there is a cold snap, because they will come out of the water, out of the river of grass where they are so exquisitely camouflaged. In a cold snap, they will come out of the water and up to the tree islands. Of course, you have seen some of those monsters--18 footers. Well, they had another critter that we have, because in Florida we do have alligators. Lo and behold, you may have seen this alligator. This alligator was 800 pounds and 15 feet long. He had been in a lake that was created in a cattle pasture, and he had been eating cows, so he had plenty of food. Well, this alligator, of course, is a critter that is native to Florida. It is the crocodile that is imported. You can tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile because the alligator has a rounded snout and the crocodile has a pointed one. All of this is to tell you we have another critter that is the most loveable critter, and we have had it on the endangered list. This is the animal called the manatee; some people call it a sea cow. These adorable creatures breathe air but live in the water. They have little flippers and a big body. Of course, they have these lovable faces. They have been endangered primarily because of boat propellers cutting them up. So we have had a serious effort at reducing the speeds of boats to a slow idle in manatee areas to protect them. They also get bothered by cold water. When there is a cold snap, they will migrate to warmer water. Pollution is another cause of the manatee being endangered. There has been a comeback. Around 20 years ago, there were only 1,200 of them in the world. That population has grown upward to 6,000. Here is the point: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to take them off the endangered list and put them into a lesser category. Those of us who want to protect these critters don't want them to come off the endangered list. If I had thought enough in advance, I would have brought a picture of a manatee. They are the most loveable critters. You can get in the water, you can swim with them, and you can feed them. When you feed them a pellet of food, they nibble like a horse nibbles sugar out of your hand--all of this under water. They are the most adorable critters. They love to be rubbed on their tummies. They love fresh water. In a brackish water system, where you can take a fresh water hose, they will come up and just drink the water, and then they will roll over so you can spray them underneath their flippers. Thank goodness they have rebounded, but there is a lot more to rebound. So, I wanted to share our crusade--our efforts to try to keep the manatee on the endangered list and to protect them. I yield the floor. Amendment No. 3680 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 3680 is agreed to. Amendment No. 3679, as Amended The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Texas Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Texas. This case is a challenge to President Obama's Executive actions to prioritize U.S. immigration enforcement. In 2012, the President used his legal authority to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA. DACA has given nearly 700,000 undocumented young people the opportunity to come out of the shadows to pursue their dreams through education and jobs. In 2014, again acting within existing legal authority, the President announced an expansion of the successful DACA Program. He also created a new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents Program, or DAPA. DAPA allows the undocumented parents of U.S.-born and legal permanent resident children, the majority of whom are U.S. citizens, to stay in this country with their families. Together, the expanded DACA and DAPA were expected to enable nearly 5 million people to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation. Unfortunately, Texas and 25 other States have challenged the President's authority to issue these Executive orders, resulting in the Supreme Court hearing today. Hundreds of DREAMers, Muslim students, and activists from California, New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere rallied on the Supreme Court steps this morning. I spoke with them and heard their stories and their hopes that the Supreme Court would make the right decision in support of the President and the millions of DACA and DAPA families. Many carried signs and stickers that read ``Keep families together.'' Keeping families together is at the crux of the President's Executive orders-- families like that of Gabriela Andrade, who, as a teenager, fled violence in Brazil and settled in Texas before coming to Hawaii. While Gabriela's sister and parents were granted visas through a lottery system, Gabriela fell through the cracks. Until President Obama announced the DACA Program, she lived in fear of being separated from her entire family. She said: DACA pulled me out of limbo and gave me a life again. It allowed me to go back to school to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science, to volunteer with several local organizations. Today, Gabriela is an advocate for DREAMers like herself. President Obama's DAPA and expanded DACA Programs would help thousands of families like Gabriela's who want to stay together and be contributing members of our communities without the daily fear of deportation. To tear undocumented parents away from their children and put these U.S.- born children in foster care is unconscionable. To deport people who were brought here when they were very young--to essentially tear them away from the United States, the only home and country they have known--is also unconscionable. These young people would be facing insurmountable odds, and I can certainly relate to some of the challenges they face. When I was almost 8 years old, my mother, brothers, and I legally immigrated to the United States. When we first arrived in Hawaii, we certainly struggled. I had to navigate the public school system without speaking a word of English. My mother worked low-paying jobs with no job security, and we struggled to make ends meet. But we took strength in being together as a family. However, in addition to facing the kind of challenges my whole family faced when we first arrived in this country, DACA and DAPA families live in constant fear that they will be ripped apart through deportation. These families and children have been living in limbo for over a year while the legal challenges work their way through the system, through the courts. In addition, United States v. Texas is also pushing DREAMers who are eligible for the original DACA Program, which is not being challenged, further into the shadows. Singai Masiya, who heads the Aloha DREAM Team in my home State and is a DREAMer himself, told my office that DACA-eligible people in Hawaii stopped applying for DACA. Why? They are afraid that if the Court rules against President Obama's Executive actions, their application information will be used to deport them. This is a real fear in our communities. United States v. Texas not only affects the lives of the more than 7,000 DACA- and DAPA-eligible Hawaii residents, it affects our economy. Over 10 years, DACA, DAPA, and expanded DACA are projected to provide a $276 million cumulative increase in Hawaii's State gross domestic product. The Center for American Progress also projects that, over 10 years, DACA, DAPA, and DACA expansion would provide a $136 million increase in the combined earnings of Hawaii's residents. However, in order to see these economic benefits, the Justices of the Supreme Court must rule on the side of DREAMers and the DAPA families. My hope is that the Supreme Court rules that the President is well within his legal authority in expanding DACA and DAPA and allows these Executive actions to be implemented. I note, however, that Executive actions, important as they are, are not enough. The President himself has called on Congress to fix our broken immigration system so that 11 million undocumented people in our country can come out of the shadows and live and work openly. It has been almost 3 years since the Senate passed bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform. I call upon Congress to do our jobs and enact fair, humane, and sensible immigration reform--recognizing that we are, indeed, a country of immigrants. That fact is at the very root of our strength as a nation. Mr. President, I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Order of Procedure Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, at 12 noon on Tuesday, April 19, the Senate vote on passage of H.R. 636, as amended; further, that following the disposition of H.R. 636, as amended, the Senate resume [[Page S2121]] consideration of S. 2012, the Energy Modernization Act, as under the previous order; that following disposition of S. 2012, as amended, if amended, but not prior to Wednesday, April 20, the cloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to H.R. 2028 be withdrawn and the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2028, the energy and water appropriations bill.

The minority whip. Immigration Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first thank the minority leader, Senator Reid, for his kind words about the DREAM Act, which I introduced 15 years ago. [[Page S2111]] This was a piece of legislation that came about because a mother called my office in Chicago. Here was her family story. She brought her two kids to America from Brazil. They actually started off in Korea, but they came through Brazil and came to Chicago--mother, father, and two kids. The father had the ambition of starting a church. There are a lot of Korean churches around Chicago and around the country, and his dream was to start a Korean-American Church. His dream never came true. He continued to pray and read the Bible, but he didn't work much. It was up to mom to go to work. She went to work in a dry-cleaning establishment in Chicago. If you have been around the great city I am honored to represent and go into a dry cleaners, most of the time Korean families are running them. They are working around-the-clock, and are the hardest working people imaginable. Mom went to work in the dry cleaners and the kids struggled because there wasn't much money coming in. One of their girls, Tereza, heard about a program in Chicago called the MERIT Music Program. It is a program that is available for low-income families of kids in public schools. The lady who left the money for it said to give them instruction in musical instruments and help them buy the instruments. Tereza Lee heard about this when she was a little girl and decided to sign up for it and to practice the piano. Well, guess what. She turned out to be a prodigy. She was amazing. For her the MERIT Music Program was like an opening to another part of the world she had never seen. She participated in recitals. Sometimes they told me they had to give her a key to the Merit music offices because she wanted to stay and practice until late at night. It was tough for her getting through high school. She tells the story, when she was interviewed in the local press, that sometimes she didn't have a lunch to take to school or any money to buy food. She would wait until the other kids left, and she would go through the wastebasket and look for food they had left behind. That is how tough it was. But because of her skill at playing the piano, she was given an opportunity. She was accepted into the Juilliard School for music in New York and at the Manhattan School of Music conservatory to pursue the piano. She was that good. When she and her mom started filling out the application, they reached that point where it said this: What is your nationality? What is your citizenship? Her mom said: Tereza, I don't know. We came here on a visitor's visa way back when you were 2 years old, but I never filed any papers for you. She said: Mom, what are we going to do? Her mom said: We are going to call Durbin's office. So they called the Senate office. We looked into it. The law in the United States was very clear for 17-year-old Tereza Lee. She had to leave the United States for 10 years and apply to come back in--leave for 10 years. She came here at the age of 2. She did not do anything wrong. She did everything right. She finished high school, against the odds. She developed a talent, against the odds. She was accepted at one of the best music schools in America, and our law very clearly said: Leave; we don't want you. If you want to try to come back in 10 years, that is your business. I don't think that is right. That is why 15 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act. It said: If you are one of those kids brought here under the age of 16, have finished high school, and have no serious criminal issues, we are going to give you a chance. Go to college or join the military and we will give you a path to ultimately getting to the back of the line but becoming a citizen of the United States--the DREAM Act. When I introduced this bill to solve Tereza Lee's problem, I used to give speeches about it all around Chicago. A funny thing would happen. When I would finish the speech and go back to my car, sometimes at night, there would be somebody waiting by my car. As I got closer, it turned out to be a very young girl, usually, maybe with her friend. They would wait to make sure no one was around. The young girl would say to me: Senator, I am one of those DREAMers. I am undocumented. My mom and dad are scared to death that they are going to be deported, and then I will be deported. I hope you can pass this. Well, time passed. We called the bill on the floor and called it in the House. We have never been able to make it the law of the land. Sadly, the reality is that there are probably 2.5 million young people living in America who would qualify under the DREAM Act to be given a chance to become legal--2.5 million. What happened to Tereza Lee? I have to finish that story. She ended up going to the Manhattan School of Music. Two families stepped forward--families that had befriended the Merit music program in Chicago. I know one of them well. They said: This girl is too good. We can't waste her talent. We will pay for her education. They did so out of pocket. She did not qualify for any Federal assistance because she is undocumented. So Tereza finished school and played in Carnegie Hall. Now she is about to complete her Ph.D. in music. She is living in Brooklyn, NY. She is a mom with a little girl. She married an American musician so she is legal--finally. That is her story. Thank goodness this determined young girl stuck with it. We have to stick with it too. The people who want to turn away these 2.5 million DREAMers ought to take a minute to meet them--just to meet them and to understand what it is to be a young person in America going through all the challenges of adolescence and all of the challenges that might be brought to you in your community or by our family and knowing in the back of your mind that at any moment, someone can knock on the door and tell you that you have to leave this country and that you are not here legally. They do it, and they fight every single day for a chance and a dream so that someday they will become part of the only country they have ever known. These are kids who, just like the Senate a few minutes ago, got up every day in the classroom and pledged allegiance to that flag, the only flag they have ever known. They do not view themselves as Mexican or Korean. They view themselves as Americans. The question is this: How do we view them? Do we view them as an asset to America or do we view them as a problem--a problem that should be thrown away and deported? You are listening to the Presidential campaign. We all are. I am not going to go into detail about some of the terrible things that have been said, but I just wish some of the haters, some of the people who want to turn on these young people, would meet them. Come and meet them. Hear their stories. I think even the hardest, coldest heart would be moved by them. Across the street--you can see it through the window--is the Supreme Court building. It was about 12 years ago that we decided to do something in the Senate that I thought was a great idea. Every 2 years, when there is a new class of Senators, we have a dinner with the Justices of the Supreme Court. We do it at their place. It is right across the street. We line up in the entryway there--the beautiful marble entryway. There are tables set up, each of us sits at a table with one of the Justices. I can remember one of the early times I went over there. I shared the table with another Senator, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a legendary Member of the Senate and former President pro tempore of the Senate. He served here for decades and carried the Constitution around in his breast pocket. In his great days he could recite poetry nonstop. He was a real believer in the Senate. He wrote the history of the Senate, one that probably will never be matched. I shared a table with him in the Supreme Court for one of these dinners. I said: Isn't this a beautiful building? He said: It sure is. I said: How often do you get over here, Senator Byrd? He said: This is my first time. I said: You have been in the Senate for 40-plus years, and this is your first time? Why? He said: Well, it is a separate branch of government. We must respect them. They had never asked me to come over. Well, I see it a little differently. I go across that street because, yes, it is a separate branch of government, but it [[Page S2112]] is one that we should understand and respect, as I hope they understand and respect Congress on this side of the street. So this morning I did. I went over for an argument before the Supreme Court. There was a huge mob out in front of the Supreme Court because the case that was being considered is one that affects millions of lives in America--Texas v. United States. The question is this: What are we going to do with people like Tereza Lee, whom I just described earlier. You see, what happened 6 years ago is that I joined with Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and wrote a letter to President Obama saying: If the Congress is not going to change the law to make it possible for these young people to stay in this country, would you issue an Executive order that allows them, at least on a temporary basis, to stay in the United States? Within a year or two, the President agreed to do it. He created what is known as the DACA Program. It basically says that young people like Tereza Lee, whom I described earlier, can step forward, identify themselves to our government, submit themselves for criminal investigation, and pay a filing fee of around $500, I believe it is. If they do, they will be given the right to stay in the United States on a temporary renewable basis for 2 years or 3 years. That is what DACA is all about--so that young people can pursue their lives at least with the understanding that for a few years, they don't have to worry about that knock on the door. Oh, if they get a job, they have to pay their taxes. If they go to college, they are not going to get a penny from this government. We don't help them pay for their college education. The President did it. I applauded him for doing it. So far, 700,000 young people just like Tereza Lee have signed up for protection under DACA. We estimate that the total universe of young people eligible is about 2.5 million. So the President attempted to extend the DACA Program. He said: We need to address the problem with their parents. Many of these parents have children who are U.S. citizens and legally in the United States, but they are undocumented and subject to deportation. So the President said, in what is known as DAPA: The parents of these kids can come forward, submit themselves to a criminal background check with fingerprints and all, pay a filing fee of around $500, and then they will be allowed, on a temporary, renewable basis, if they keep their noses clean, to work in this country. If they are going to work in this country, they have to pay their taxes. Well, that is what the President suggested. As soon as he made these two proposals to extend DACA and to create this other program for the parents, a lawsuit was filed. It was led by the State of Texas, and 25 other States, I believe, joined. That is the case before the Supreme Court today. Before I get into the details of that case--and I want to say a word about it on the floor this afternoon--let me say one other thing. What Senator Byrd told me about not going across the street was not only respect for that institution of the Supreme Court, but as a Senator he was basically saying that we need to respect their right to be above politics. We want to make certain that that branch of government is above politics, that they apply the law and interpret the Constitution in a nonpolitical way. Sometimes I read their decisions and think they have gone political on us. But the goal is to make sure they are preserved from becoming political. This morning, when I went before the Supreme Court, I did not face nine Justices, only eight. Antonin Scalia, who passed away a few weeks ago, created a vacancy that has not been filled. Why has the Senate failed to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court? Because within hours of the untimely death of Justice Scalia, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, who was here a few moments ago, announced publicly: We will not fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court. That is important to remember. It is the first time in the history of the United States of America--the first time in the history of the Senate--that the Senate is refusing a hearing for a Presidential nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has never happened before--never. Oh, the Republicans argue: Well, if the shoe were on the other foot, I am sure you Democrats would do exactly the same thing. I call their attention to the year 1988. Republican President Ronald Reagan, with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, submitted the name of Anthony Kennedy to the Senate. A Republican President was filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and he submitted the name of his nominee. The Senate, then controlled by the Democrats, gave Anthony Kennedy a hearing, a strong vote, and sent him over to the Supreme Court. So when the shoe was on the other foot, we did not play politics. But now we are. So I faced eight Justices over there as that argument was made this morning. I thought to myself: If they end up in a 4-to-4 tie--and that can happen--it will be chaos and confusion across America, with different courts and different districts having different interpretations of the same law. How did we get into this mess? Because the Republican majority in the Senate has decided: We are not going to appoint anyone to fill this vacancy. Their argument is this: Let the American people speak to filling this vacancy in the Presidential election. Let them decide whether it will be a Democrat or a Republican President filling this vacancy. There might be some value to that argument if President Obama, in the last election, when he was running for reelection in 2012, had been running for a term of 3 years. You can argue then that this fourth year he was not entitled to be President. But you know what. It turns out that he was running for a 4-year term. It turns out he won by 5 million votes. It turns out that when it comes to being Commander in Chief and President of the United States, he has all the powers vested in him by the Constitution, even in the fourth year. Isn't that amazing--4 years as the President? That is what the American people decided, but only to be overruled by the Republican majority in the Senate. Sorry, Mr. President, they say, you only get 3 years. Maybe we give you 3 years and 2 months, but you sure don't have the right to try and fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, even though the Constitution explicitly says in article II, section 2: The President shall appoint a nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Their argument is that you may think you are President when it comes to the Supreme Court, but the Senate Republican majority thinks otherwise. I sat down with Merrick Garland. He is the proposed nominee to fill this vacancy. He is chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, which is a high position in the judiciary. He was born in Illinois, so I come to his nomination with some prejudice, but he is an extraordinary person. People have said: Well, why didn't the President choose a woman? Why didn't the President choose an African American? Why didn't he choose a Hispanic? Why didn't he choose someone from India? Why did he choose this man? I think he chose him for an obvious reason: He is clearly qualified. Even Republican Senators have said nice things about him publicly. Many of them have said they refuse to even meet with him, will not even sit in the same room with him. Some have agreed to, but many have said no. Senator McConnell said: I won't meet with him because he is not going to get a hearing and he is not going to get a vote. It is time for us to fill that vacancy. It is time for us to accept our constitutional responsibility and show respect for the document we all swore to uphold and defend when we took the oath of office. It is time to fill that vacancy and put nine Justices on the Supreme Court to avoid the uncertainty, confusion, and chaos which might otherwise emerge. I wish to say a word about the case before the Court this morning. This was a case--United States v. Texas--a legal challenge, as I mentioned earlier, to the President's immigration policy, filed by 26 Republican Governors. I believe this lawsuit has no legal merit. It is driven by political hostility toward President Obama and his immigration policy. I was proud to join an amicus brief signed by 39 Senators on our side of the aisle and 186 House Democrats in support of the administration's decision [[Page S2113]] on immigration. The President is on very solid ground in this case. I am hoping and confident that the Supreme Court will rule in his favor. As an initial matter before the case proceeds, the States that filed this lawsuit have to show they will be harmed by the President's immigration policy. Otherwise, they really don't have any standing to sue. It turns out that exactly the opposite is true. The President's policy allowing people to work here on a temporary basis under his Executive orders will create a huge benefit to the American economy. Over the next 10 years, in the State of Texas alone--and they brought the lawsuit; at least started it--the President's immigration action would increase that State's gross domestic product by more than $38 billion and increase the earnings of all Texas residents by $17.5 billion. They argue that the President's immigration policy would cost the State of Texas money. It turns out that exactly the opposite is true. Even if the States have standing to sue, the Supreme Court repeatedly has held that the Federal Government has broad authority to decide questions of immigration. Justice Anthony Kennedy, appointed earlier, wrote the opinion for the Court striking down Arizona's controversial immigration law. Listen to what he said: A principal feature of the removal system-- Removal of people who are not eligible to be in the United States-- is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials. . . . Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime. This administration's immigration policy is not just legal, it is smart and realistic. The President has said simply: We should prioritize. We have limited resources. We can't deport all those who are here undocumented. If we are only going to deport some, let's pick those who are a danger to the United States. The President has focused on those who have been convicted of serious crimes or pose a threat to our security. And shouldn't he? As Commander in Chief, shouldn't that be his highest priority, to make sure anyone who is a danger to the United States is gone? He knows he can't deport all even if he wished to, so he focuses on those who may be a danger to the United States--prosecutorial discretion. The Department of Homeland Security only has enough funding to deport a small fraction of undocumented, so the President wants to focus the limited resources on those who could do us harm. That is just common sense. At the same time, the President said that we should not waste our resources on deporting young immigrant students who grow up in this country, such as Tereza Lee, whom I mentioned earlier, or tear apart families by deporting the parents of U.S. citizens. The President's policy is focused on deporting felons, not families--criminals, not children. In November of 2014, President Obama established this program, DAPA, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents. Under DAPA, undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for more than 5 years and have American children would be required to come forward, register with the government, pay a fee, go through a criminal background check and a national security background check, and pay their taxes. If the government determines these parents have not committed any serious crimes and don't pose any threat, this Executive order says: On a temporary, renewable basis, they will not be targeted for deportation. President Obama also expanded the DACA Program for children, as I mentioned earlier, at the same time. Why did he do that? Because for years Republicans in Congress have refused to consider legislation to fix our broken immigration system. On the floor of the Senate on June 27, 2013, I joined a group of seven other Senators--four Democrats and four Republicans in total. We had worked for months to construct a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill. We had to give a lot. There were things in that bill which I didn't like at all and things which some of the Republican Senators didn't like, but it is the nature of legislation and compromise that that happens. We brought the bill to the floor for a vote after a lengthy markup in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and dozens of amendments had been offered. The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation on June 27, 2013, 68 to 32--more than 2 to 1. That bill would have strengthened border security, protected American workers, and established a tough but fair path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who were then currently living in our country. What happened to the bill after it passed the Senate? I take you back to how laws are made and your civics course. It went across the Rotunda to the House of Representatives, which was under Republican control. The majority in the House of Representatives refused to call the bill, refused to even bring it to the floor for a debate, and refused to offer any substitute. They did nothing--nothing, despite our broken immigration system. In the face of this, the President was left with no choice. For the good of the American people, he used the authority given him as President to try to make some reforms to our immigration system. The Center for American Progress has studied what the President proposed, and they say that over the next 10 years, if these two programs--DACA and DAPA--were passed, the gross domestic product for my home State of Illinois would increase by $15 billion and the earnings of Illinois residents would increase by almost $8 billion. Could your State use that--more economic activity, more people paying taxes to the Federal Government and to your State? Virtually every State could use that. It is unfortunate that these bills have been blocked by the Senate, and now they are trying to block them in the Supreme Court. I see Senator Cornyn is on the floor, and I will close by telling a story about another DREAMer. I have done this quite a few times. My staff has done a lot of work on it. I thank them all for it. These stories really say a lot more than I ever could in a speech. They tell us what was at stake before the Supreme Court of the United States this morning. This attractive young woman is Vasthy Lamadrid. Her family came to the United States from Mexico. She was 5 years old. They came here with nothing. They moved into a home with four other families, so a lot of the kids slept in the same room. Despite their poverty, Vasthy felt safe and excelled in school. Math was her best subject. She had nearly perfect scores on standardized tests. English was tough, but then she discovered a series of books called ``Goosebumps.'' If you have kids or grandkids, I bet you have heard of that one. She became an avid reader and mastered the English language. By middle school, Vasthy was placed in the gifted program. That is where she discovered her love of engineering. She was a student in the Engineering Pathway at Bioscience High School, where she received the Young Entrepreneurs Award, made the principal's list every semester, and played tennis. She was an active volunteer, working with such groups as Girls For Change, CompuGirls, E-Tech, Hospice of the Valley, and St. Joseph's Hospital. Vasthy also helped younger kids in her neighborhood by tutoring them in math and tennis. Vasthy went on to attend Arizona State University. Because she is undocumented, she didn't qualify for a penny of government assistance, and she had to pay out-of-State tuition despite the fact that she had lived her entire life in the United States, in Arizona. Then something extraordinary happened. Counting on the generosity of the American people, Vasthy decided to crowdfund her college education. She shared her life story online and asked people to contribute to help her pay her tuition. Well, it worked. She is currently in her second year of college. In the first semester, she made the dean's list with a 3.79 GPA in the Ira Fulton School of Engineering. Thanks to DACA--the Presidential Executive order--she is able to support herself. She has also made time to continue to volunteer for a club called [[Page S2114]] STEM Academy mentoring young children. She volunteers with the Arizona Immigration Refugee Service as an English teacher. As a result of her volunteer work, she has decided she wants to become a science teacher. Can we use more science teachers in America? You bet. This is what she said in a letter she wrote: DACA signifies to me a chance to show that I belong here-- that inside I am an American. It represents an opportunity to show that my parents' sacrifice was worth it. I love this country and want to one day become a citizen and continue to give back to the community. I don't need that journey to become a citizen to be easily given to me, but I'd hope that the journey is fair. Vasthy and other DREAMers have so much they can give to America. I don't understand the Republican Party when it comes to the issue of immigration. We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country. I am a first-generation American and proud of it. It is my honor to serve and represent a great State like Illinois. I know what her journey was like. She was brought here at the age of 2 from Lithuania. I know what her early life was like as she struggled to try to make sure there was food on the table, first for her mom, sister, and brother, and then ultimately for her own family. That is my family's story, but it is a story that is repeated over and over again. There is something in the DNA of immigrants who are willing to risk everything in this world to go to a country where they don't even speak the language because they know they will have an opportunity here, and they bring something with them. That is why they light up the scoreboard in Silicon Valley with all of these new inventions and new corporations with thousands of employees that make us an economic success in many fields. That is why we should think twice about those who condemn immigrants in this Nation of immigrants. I am confident the Supreme Court will uphold the President's immigration actions. Then I hope, after they have done this, that the Republicans in Congress will finally decide to return to the table and work on a bipartisan basis for comprehensive immigration reform. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip is recognized. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am always impressed with the distinguished Democratic whip and his eloquence, but he is telling the American people that we have to choose between being a nation of immigrants or a nation of laws. The fact is, we don't have to make that choice; we can be both. But we can't do it when we have a President who simply believes he can do an end run around the U.S. Constitution. In fact, according to Pew, about 3.5 million people could claim the benefits of the President's unlawful Executive action, receiving work permits, driver's licenses, and Social Security numbers. While we are a compassionate country, we are a nation of immigrants, that is not the kind of decision the Constitution gives to a single political actor, even if he is the President of the United States. So there is a right way and a wrong way. And I realize the distinguished Democratic whip believes that just because they can't get what they want when they want it, the President can then resort to this end run, but thankfully that is not the view of the courts. The U.S. Federal district court in Brownsville, TX, issued an injunction against the President's Executive action. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that injunction, and now the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments in the case this afternoon. This is really more than just about immigration. This is whether, under the doctrine of separation of powers, the Constitution we have lived under for lo these many years gives the President unilateral authority without the approval of Congress, the elected representatives of the people, and in flagrant disregard for the laws that are already on the books. The heart of the case the Court heard today is about stopping a President who said: I have a pen and I have a phone. And even though the American people have given Republicans a majority in both Houses and obviously forced the President to deal with a Republican conference to come up with consensus legislation, the President said: Forget that. I am not about trying to achieve bipartisan consensus on anything. If I don't get what I want, I am going to jam it through the system and hope the courts don't stop me. So it is not just about immigration, it is about the Constitution itself. There are perhaps 22 different times, by my count, where the President of the United States acknowledged he didn't even have this authority. I remember in a speech he gave to La Raza, an interview he gave on Univision, the President denied he had the authority, which now, miraculously, our Democratic friends think is clear-cut under the law. How can that be? It cannot be. I remember specifically being at a meeting where the President invited the leadership of both the House and the Senate to the White House after the 2014 election. Many may recall that leading up to that point, there had been a lot of rumors about the President issuing an Executive action, but he had not done so. I remember specifically sitting there in the White House with some of my colleagues from the House and the Senate, where then-Speaker Boehner said to the President: Please, Mr. President, don't do this. Don't poison the well. Don't make it impossible, by such a polarizing action, for us to build consensus on the building blocks of immigration reform where we could actually agree. I remember Majority Leader McCarthy making the same comment. I joined in and reiterated the same point. The President, defiant, told us he was going to go ahead and do it. There are a lot of conversations people are having today across the United States. I had some of those earlier today during some visits with people who were just wondering how to explain the political environment in America today. What I tell them is that this seems unprecedented in my experience. People are so angry. People are so scared. People are frightened and worried about the next generation. And for the first time in my memory, parents are doubting whether their children will enjoy the same sorts of freedom and prosperity that we enjoy today. That is a tragedy. My parents were part of the ``greatest generation.'' My dad was a B- 17 pilot in the Army Air Corps, even before the Air Force came into being. On his 26th bombing mission over Nazi Germany, while he was flying in the 8th Air Force out of Molesworth, England, he was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war for 4 months. Fortunately, that was toward the tail end of the war. Even though he was injured in his parachute jump--not seriously, as it turned out, although he had some disability associated with that later in life--he managed to survive that and even survived an appendectomy by a fellow prisoner of war when he had appendicitis in a POW camp. It is amazing. I always thought my dad had nine lives. Even though he passed away at the very young age of 67, he survived countless occasions when surely he could have lost his life, including those occasions of jumping out of a burning B-17 plane over Germany and an appendectomy in a POW camp at the hands of a fellow prisoner of war. The reason my parents and all of our parents sacrificed so much and risked so much and worked so hard is that they believed in the promise of America--the promise that exists only when the law is respected, when people in high office are bound by and obligated to and held accountable to the same laws that govern the most humble among us. That is what America is all about--a country where people, if they work hard and play by the rules, can achieve their dreams. I think that is the reason America seems so polarized today. People have sort of jumped outside the usual paradigm of political calculation where you are a liberal or you are a conservative or you are somewhere in the middle. People have sort of jumped that track, and we are seeing something entirely different on the left and on the right. I think the reason is, in part, because of a President who believes he is not bound by the Constitution and laws of the United States. People are frightened because they have seen over the last 7 years-- even though the President was stopped legislatively after the Affordable Care Act [[Page S2115]] was passed and after Dodd-Frank was passed and then stopped by the electorate giving the Republicans a majority in the House and in 2014 a majority in Senate--that this President will not be stopped by the voters. That is the determination he made, and this Executive order is exhibit 1 because he said: I don't care what the voters think. I don't care what the American people think. I don't care what the Constitution says. I don't care that what Congress says should be the law of the land. I am going to do it the way I want to do it. Frankly, that is scary stuff when you are talking about the Commander in Chief, the leader of the free world, and the sort of power that goes along with that. Rather than heed the warning--or I would really call it the plea of leaders in the House and the Senate after the 2014 election--the President decided to go around Congress and try to essentially change the law, giving work permits to people who were illegally present in the country, giving them driver's licenses, even giving Social Security numbers to an estimated 3.5 million people. How can the President do this when Congress is deadlocked? Well, he did it. And that is a question the Supreme Court is going to have to decide. At the time, the President called it a middle-ground approach. He is a master of rhetoric. The problem is the facts belie his words. The fact of the matter is this was a constitutional scorched-earth tactic. And more than anything else, it eroded public confidence in Congress's ability, working with the White House, to get anything constructive done in the area of immigration. The Acting President pro tempore is, of course, from the great State of Oklahoma, and he went to school in Texas. He understands what I understand: We have a large Hispanic population in Texas--about 38 percent. But we are a very diverse State. Many people are surprised when I tell them the third most commonly spoken language in Texas today is Vietnamese--Vietnamese. Can you believe that? We also have a large Indian American population. We are a very diverse State, and the main reason for that is we still represent that land of opportunity that America used to be, where people can come, work hard--those of modest means, with little on their backs and maybe nothing in their pockets--and achieve something and live the American dream. So I resent, I really do resent, the distinguished Senator from Illinois trying to tell us the President was only trying to do something that was good for Texas. He doesn't have a clue. In fact, if we were to follow the policy choices of the leadership in Texas, the country would be a heck of a lot better off when it comes to taking advantage of our energy resources, when it comes to taxes, reasonable regulation, and a willingness to try to accommodate those who invest capital and create jobs. To me, that is the single biggest difference between where I live in Texas and what I see across our country and what is coming out of Washington, DC. There seems to be an attitude here in Washington of how many more obstacles, how many larger impediments can we place in the way of those who invest the capital and those who are creating the jobs and still expect the American dream to be alive. Believe me, we have tested it. The Obama administration has tested it, and what it has produced is disaster. It has produced a health care system that, rather than making health care more affordable, has made it more expensive, has caused people who liked their coverage to give up their coverage only to buy something that had a deductible that has, in essence, made them self-insured. It has created stagnant wages. It has created stagnant economic growth. There are not a lot of problems we have in this country that couldn't be mitigated, made better, if we just saw our economy growing again, instead of the sort of anemic and flatlined growth we have seen since 2008. My predecessor in the Senate, Mr. Phil Gramm, has a Ph.D. in economics from Texas A&M University. He has made the point that, historically, what you see after a recession like the one we saw following the fiscal crisis in 2008 is a V-shape recovery. In other words, you hit the bottom and you bounce up and you grow quickly because basically you have worked the problems out of the system. But what we have seen since 2008 is a U-shaped recovery, if you could even call it that. It is pretty close to flat, where the economy is growing at less than 2 percent, which is not fast enough to keep people fully employed. And we still have--although the unemployment rate has dropped down, we still have the smallest percentage of people participating in the workforce that we have had in the last 30 years. Many people have simply given up, retired early, or made other arrangements. This is a serious matter. The Supreme Court heard arguments today. We know there are currently eight members of the Supreme Court. I heard the distinguished Democratic whip complain about the fact that we have decided to allow the voters to choose in November the President who will make the choice to fill the Scalia vacancy. Well, the fact of the matter is, it is simply too important to allow President Obama, given his penchant for lawlessness and usurpation of constitutional authority--to give him the chance to stack the Supreme Court in favor of a Court that would likely rubberstamp his actions and those of future Presidents for the next 25 years. The hypocrisy is rich, listening to our Democratic colleagues. These are the folks who invented the judicial filibuster. They invented the judicial filibuster. They did that when President George W. Bush was President. As controversial as the nomination of Clarence Thomas was, I believe he was confirmed with 52 votes--not 60 votes but 52 because nobody dreamed back then that Senate rules would allow the minority party to insist on 60 votes to confirm a President's appointee. We know that after the election where the Democratic majority lost that majority, in a lameduck session they jammed a number of appointees onto the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in an effort to pack that court to match the ideological picture they wanted. Again, this is the second most important court in the Nation, which they believed would be more inclined to rubberstamp the overreaching by the Obama administration. We are all familiar with the Biden speech in 1992 when, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he suggested it would be perhaps inappropriate to confirm a Presidential nominee in the waning days of that President's term. We saw the Harry Reid speech in 2005, where he said it is the President's prerogative to appoint, but the Senate is not obligated to grant consent to that nomination. Actually, I agree with Senator Reid back then, but not today, when he has taken the exact opposite approach. Then there is Senator Schumer, the heir apparent to the Democratic leadership in the Senate, who said, in 2007, 18 months before George W. Bush left office: I think there ought to be a presumption against confirmation. To listen to my Democratic colleagues complain about the decision we have made to let the voters vote for the President who is going to fill that vacancy and to watch them--well, it looks like crocodile tears to me, and it smells like hypocrisy. As we have said, the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments today in a case brought by the State of Texas and other States that would otherwise be compelled to grant work permits, issue driver's licenses and Social Security numbers to people illegally present in the United States who did not comply with our laws. I am confident the Court will find that the States have suffered real harm from the standpoint of the constitutional notion of standing; in other words, you have to have standing before you can sue. Basically, it means you have to show real or potential harm if the Court doesn't act. I am confident the Court will find standing. But the Court will do one of two things. Either the Court will affirm by being split 4 to 4 or all eight Justices could write in favor of the Fifth Circuit decision to let the injunction stand or, if the Court deems that this issue needs to be held over until the Court has all nine members, after the first of the year, that is a decision the Court can make. This is a very important issue, and I am glad the Court is taking it up. We [[Page S2116]] need to know--we need to know whether we remain a nation of laws as well as a nation of immigrants. The whole idea our Democratic colleagues have foisted on us that somehow we have to choose between those two is a false choice. It is a false choice. We are both. We aren't one or the other. America has always been made better by people who have risked coming to the United States because they weren't satisfied with what they had or where they lived, but the day we begin rewarding people who do this in disregard of the laws is the day we begin to no longer be a nation of laws, and that is a legacy and a treasure we should not squander. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Nebraska. Tax Reform Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to discuss an issue of importance for Nebraskans and Americans all across this country; that is, the need for comprehensive tax reform. It is no secret the current Tax Code is overly complex and outdated. Any American can tell you how frustrating it is to file a tax return. Our Tax Code is riddled with deductions, exemptions, credits, exclusions, preferences, and loopholes that make it nearly impossible for anyone without a degree in tax law to understand. At the same time, we should recognize that some progress has been made. Thanks to the work of Chairman Hatch and members of the Senate Finance Committee, many important updates to the Tax Code were made permanent at the end of last year. In particular, increasing the deduction limit and making permanent section 179 of the Tax Code was an important step. This section allows small businesses to deduct from their taxes certain depreciable business assets. My constituents told me annual uncertainty about whether section 179 would be renewed made it very difficult for them to plan, to invest, and to grow their businesses. Making this provision permanent reduced the ambiguity that had plagued Nebraska's small business owners and operators. Although we have made some progress in reforming the Tax Code, there is more work to do for the American people. I believe tax reform should focus on several principles, including competitiveness, simplicity, and economic growth. At nearly 40 percent, the United States has the highest combined corporate tax rate in the developed world. This is stifling job growth, hurting families, and compelling businesses to move overseas. Any comprehensive plan should seek to lower this rate to a competitive level, one that will not only encourage current businesses to stay but also incentivize new businesses to set up shop. Another goal of comprehensive tax reform should be to simplify the Tax Code. Families and businesses spend billions of hours every year in completing their taxes. A disproportionate share of this burden is shouldered by many small businesses. Many of these are family businesses, and they don't have the resources to easily comply. Creating a tax system that is simple and efficient will reduce administrative and compliance costs. A simple tax system will also increase transparency, allowing Americans to fill out their taxes accurately while preventing fraud and lost revenue. Perhaps most importantly, any plan to reform the Tax Code--well, it must spur economic growth. Inaction on reforming the Tax Code is delaying needed growth in GDP, jobs, and investment. When I was first elected to the Senate, I thought my colleagues and I would immediately take up two issues to restart our economy, grow jobs, and help all American families: tax reform and reducing the overburden of government regulations. After all, it is pretty obvious these are two issues we can reform that would have a positive impact on our economy. We see regulations become ever more burdensome, and they continue to depress our economy, stifle innovation, and hurt our families. Major tax reform has not happened. We continue to chip away, but I believe now is the time we step up and be bolder. We must make the necessary reforms to our tax system to give Americans confidence in our future. We need to help put more money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans and allow them to spend money on the goods and services they choose and that they need. It is my hope my colleagues will join me in continuing this discussion and that this dialogue then will eventually result in action, in comprehensive tax reform that truly benefits Nebraskans and the American people. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. China's Aluminum Industry Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, over the last few decades, China has used market-distorting subsidies and industrial policies to repeatedly prop up their own industries and rip off American jobs. Steel, tires, solar panels--the story plays out again and again. Too often China's economy is not run by the markets; it is run by government committee. So even though its own State Council has called out the problem of severe excess capacities, China clings to the same old tired and destructive policies. Today I want to address what is happening now with China's huge overcapacity of aluminum. The amount of aluminum Chinese smelters are churning out has gone up by more than 1,200 percent in a decade and a half. In 2000, they produced 2.5 million metric tons. In 2015 China produced 32 million metric tons. When you create a glut of aluminum production the way China has, you send the markets into turmoil and you do enormous harm to American workers. I spoke last week at a public hearing held by the U.S. Trade Representative and the International Trade Commission about how the overproduction of steel in China is an urgent and immediate threat to steel jobs here in our country. While China's steel mills are churning out more steel than ever, American steel towns are suffering or worse. Thousands of jobs nationwide have been lost just in the last year. Even though one-third of all steel produced today has no buyer, China keeps adding and adding to the glut by producing more steel. The same story is played out in the case of primary aluminum. There is a huge overcapacity in China that, once again, is driven by market- distorting government policies. It has unleashed a chain of events that can end in economic devastation across this country. Global aluminum prices have already plummeted, undercutting our American companies. Between the start of 2011 and this upcoming June, the lights will have gone out at nearly two-thirds of the aluminum smelters in the United States. More than 6,500 jobs--good American jobs--will have been lost. You can bet that sooner or later the damage will ripple downstream through the entire aluminum industry, which employs three-quarters of a million Americans either directly or indirectly. In my judgment, the United States is badly in need of a safeguard against this economic tidal wave. That is why I have chosen to stand with my friend Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, and the steelworkers. They filed a petition for relief under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 today. Without an immediate economic bulwark, the United States is in danger of losing thousands of good family-wage jobs across our country. It is my view that the administration should act in this case as soon as possible to defend our workers and our businesses from economic ruin. The United States and our trading partners must ramp up the pressure on China to stop overproduction, and our trade enforcers have to take on the trade cheats and use every single trade tool in the toolbox, including the ENFORCE Act, the Leveling the Playing Field Act, and the other measures my colleagues and I on the Finance Committee fought to get signed into law over the last year. I firmly believe workers in Oregon and across this country can compete with anybody in the world, but the United States cannot afford to sit idly by and watch China's destructive policies cause our aluminum industry to be wiped out. As the steelworkers have pointed out repeatedly, enough is [[Page S2117]] enough. Leo Gerard and those steelworkers are standing up and fighting back, and I am honored to stand with them. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in a few moments, we will be voting on ending debate on H.R. 636, and that will allow us to proceed to a vote on the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016. I wish to urge my colleagues to support that motion to end debate. The legislation we are considering is not just any FAA reauthorization. This bill is the most pro-passenger and pro-security FAA reauthorization in recent history. Travelers are frustrated, and this bill contains commonsense reforms to make travel safe and secure and more passenger-friendly. For over 2 weeks on the Senate floor now and before that in the Commerce Committee, where I serve as chairman, we have been working hard to thoughtfully develop this bill and to allow for robust debate. For instance, there are drone safety provisions in the bill, including a pilot program to deploy technology to intercept drones near airports. These provisions are obviously intended to prevent accidents like the one that happened outside the Heathrow Airport this weekend, where a drone hit an approaching plane. We developed this provision and others in the bill through an open process that allowed every member of the committee to contribute and help write the bill. Last year, we held six hearings on topics that helped inform our bill, and at the committee markup last month alone, we accepted 57 amendments, 34 of which were sponsored by Democrats and 23 by Republicans. On the Senate floor, when it was reported out and taken up, we added 19 amendments, 10 from Democrats and 9 from Republican Senators. The resulting bill is one we can be proud of, and both sides of the aisle have commended us for our inclusive process. When there have been differences, we have been able to find ways to address or set those aside for later so the progress on the legislation could move forward. Even at this late hour, we have worked constructively to assemble a possible managers' package of more than two dozen additional amendments that we would like to adopt by voice vote prior to final passage. Yet, even if that is not possible, I commit to those Senators whose amendments we stand prepared to accept that I will work to address their concerns as we engage with our colleagues in the House of Representatives. Now it is time to conclude our work on the bipartisan FAA bill that I introduced a long ways back, along with my friend and ranking member, Senator Bill Nelson, and our Aviation Subcommittee leaders, Senators Kelly Ayotte and Maria Cantwell. The bill includes reforms benefiting the traveling public, and we shouldn't let them down. Let's vote yes on the motion to end debate and start moving these historic reforms forward. As I mentioned, I have a list of 26 amendments that we would like to clear--amendments offered by both sides. It is a package we could adopt. We have a couple of objections to doing that. If the Members who have put forward those objections would be willing to release those objections, we would be able to get another 26 amendments adopted, many of which have been offered by colleagues, as I said, on both sides and many of which contain measures that I think will make the bill even stronger and make it a product we can all be proud of as it moves over to the House of Representatives. There, I hope it will receive consideration and action and ultimately end up on the President's desk. The FAA bill is legislation we have to do on a fairly routine basis around here. This authorization will stand for about 18 months. There are a number of important considerations that need to be addressed that this bill not only acknowledges but addresses. As I mentioned, those considerations have to do with drone safety, which is an increasingly important issue in our economy and one where we need to make sure we have the right rules of the air, if you will, in place so that we preserve and ensure that safety is the No. 1 factor as we continue to see the increased research, development, and deployment of drone technologies in ways that have tremendous commercial application. As I said, it also includes a lot of passenger protections which are very consumer-friendly in terms of passengers who travel on a regular basis with the airlines. So those are things as well that we need to address in this legislation. We enhanced the bill by amendment when it came to the floor with a couple of safety provisions that we think are critically important, particularly in light of what has happened of late with the attack in Brussels and a number of other attacks we have seen, where we have had aviation insiders involved, if you will--particularly the Metrojet airliner that crashed not that long ago and killed 224 people. There are a number of safety provisions that help address some of those concerns. As I said, we expand the TSA precheck program to limit the number of people who are in areas outside secure areas--outside the perimeter, so to speak--where they are more vulnerable to these types of attacks. These are all included in this legislation. So from an aviation security standpoint, this bill includes the most comprehensive security measures we will have adopted in nearly a decade. As I said before, from a passenger-friendly standpoint, according to a columnist at the Washington Post, this is one of the most passenger-friendly FAA reauthorization bills we have seen literally in a generation. So these are reasons why this bill needs to move forward. I hope my colleagues here in the Senate, when the vote comes here in a few minutes, will cast a vote in support of ending debate and allow us to move forward to a vote on final passage, which will enable this legislation to move forward to the House of Representatives and I hope ultimately to the President so he can sign it into law and put many of these provisions in place that would be good for our country. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Immigration Enforcement Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today, I wish to pay tribute to Sarah Root, a young woman from Iowa who just graduated from college with perfect grades. She was devoted to her family and friends and had a bright future, but she was taken from this earth too soon. I want to express my sympathies to Sarah's parents and acknowledge Michelle Root, Sarah's mother, who is watching today. She will be testifying tomorrow before the House Committee on the Judiciary at a hearing titled, ``The Real Victims of a Reckless and Lawless Immigration Policy: Families and Survivors Speak Out on the Real Cost of This Administration's Policies.'' The hearing will focus on how the Obama administration's failed immigration policies allow thousands of criminal aliens to roam free. Michelle Root will share her personal story about the loss of her daughter and how someone in the country illegally was able to walk free and abscond from authorities after fatally hitting her daughter's vehicle on graduation night. Sarah was 21 years old and had just graduated from Bellevue University with an interest in pursuing a career in criminal justice. In the words of her family, ``she was full of life and ready to take on the world.'' According to a close friend of hers, Sarah was smart, outgoing, and dedicated to her friends and family. She embodied the words: ``live, laugh, love.'' The day Sarah graduated, she was struck by a drunk driver in the country illegally. The alleged drunk driver was Edwin Mejia, who had a blood alcohol [[Page S2118]] content of more than three times the legal limit. The driver was charged with felony motor vehicle homicide and operating a vehicle while intoxicated on February 3. Bail was set at $50,000, but he was only required to put up 10 percent. So, for a mere $5,000, the drunk driver walked out of jail and into the shadows. This case has shed light on the breakdown between the Federal Government and State and locals. It has also been a terrible example of why the President's policies don't work, and how they are having a dire effect on American families like the Root family. Under President Obama's Priority Enforcement Program, a person in the country illegally will only be detained or removed in a few limited circumstances. The administration hides behind these so-called ``priorities'' to ensure that a vast majority of people in the country are not removed. Some say that nearly 90,000 illegal immigrant criminals were released in 2015 because of this policy. The administration's polices result in tragedies like Sarah's. A smart young lady who had a bright future was struck by a drunk driver who entered the country illegally, and was turned over to a brother who was also in the country illegally, while awaiting his immigration court date. After the accident, local law enforcement apparently asked the Federal government--specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement--to take custody of the driver, but the Federal government declined. ICE refused to place a detainer on him. An ICE spokesman stated that the agency did not lodge a detainer on the man because his arrest for felony motor vehicle homicide ``did not meet ICE's enforcement priorities.'' The driver made bond and absconded, never showing up for his hearings and required drug tests. It is difficult for the family to have closure since the man is nowhere to be found. It is unknown if he is still in the United States or if he has fled to his home country of Honduras. Sarah Root is one of many victims who have been harmed or killed because of lax immigration enforcement and the notion that drunk driving isn't always a public safety threat. Even though this tragic accident happened in the heartland of America, this is a border security problem. The driver of the vehicle that killed Sarah entered the country illegally. Every day, people are illegally entering the country, being removed, entering again, and committing more crimes. Illegal re-entries are happening because there are no consequences. That is what happened in Kate Steinle's death. And, that is why we need to move on Kate's law. That bill would deter people from illegally re-entering by enhancing penalties and establishing new mandatory minimum sentences for certain individuals with previous felony convictions. The Obama administration cannot continue to turn a blind eye to drunk drivers, sanctuary communities, and people who ignore our laws, overstay their visas, or cross the border time and again. I am still waiting for answers from the Obama administration on this case, and many more. There are many unanswered questions. How many more people have to die? How many more women and young people are going to be taken from their family and friends? Things have got to change. The President must rethink his policies and must find a way to ensure that criminal immigrants are taken off the streets. The Obama administration should try enforcing the law, instead of its priorities, for the sake of the American people. I want to wish Michelle Root the best of luck while she is in Washington this week, and send my thoughts to her father who is trying to find justice back home. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Ohio. Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the sentiments shared by our senior Senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley. Tomorrow morning, one of my constituents, Michelle Root, will be testifying before the House Judiciary Committee about the loss of her beautiful young daughter, Sarah Root. As a mother of three daughters myself, I cannot begin to fathom the pain and anguish Mrs. Root is experiencing. Earlier this year, 21-year-old Sarah Root was killed by a drunk driver. That driver, Edwin Mejia, was allegedly drag racing with a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit when he crashed into the back of Sarah's vehicle. Edwin Mejia is also an illegal immigrant. After causing the death of an American citizen and being charged with motor vehicle homicide, one would think he would clearly meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's so-called enforcement priorities. But no, citing the administration's November 2014 memo on immigration enforcement priorities, ICE declined to lodge a detainer and take custody of Mejia. During a recent Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, ICE Director Sarah Saldana actually suggested that ICE neglected to issue a detainer because at the time they were contacted, Sarah Root was seriously injured, not dead. How twisted and convoluted has our immigration system become that an illegal immigrant who, while driving drunk and drag racing, hits and either seriously injures or kills an American citizen is not considered a priority for deportation? In fact, only after a floor speech, multiple letters, and hearing questions from Senators from Nebraska and Iowa, as well as media attention and concerns raised by the Root family, did ICE finally acknowledge that they should have taken Mejia into custody. It should not take all of those actions for ICE to determine that an illegal immigrant who kills an American citizen should be removed from our country. Tragically, after ICE declined to file a detainer against Mejia, he posted a $5,000 bond, was released, and has since disappeared. This is so despite the fact that he had a history of skipping court dates related to prior driving offenses. A few weeks ago, I spoke with Sarah's dad, who told me that before they could even lay their daughter to rest, Mejia was released. This is truly an injustice, and we must do everything we can to ensure that we get answers in this case and prevent a similar tragedy from being replicated elsewhere. While America has been and always will be a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. It is a privilege to live in this country, and anyone who comes here illegally and harms our citizens should without question constitute a priority for removal. For ICE to decide otherwise is baffling. In recognition of their clear mistake, they have since listed Mejia on their ``most wanted'' list and acknowledged they should have taken him into custody. The photograph of Sarah behind me was taken as she celebrated her graduation from Bellevue University with a 4.0 GPA and a bachelor's degree in criminal investigations and prepared to begin a bright future. The next day, she was killed. While nothing can bring Sarah back, her family and friends deserve clear answers as to why Mejia was allowed to flee. This tragedy further underscores the administration's failed immigration enforcement priorities and should serve to spur renewed discussion about their so- called priorities. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, there are a lot of people in this country who work very, very hard. We are known in this country as a people who work hard. Montanans are no exception. We have some of the hardest working folks I know who live in that great State. Whether it is a farmer preparing the spring crop or a fishing guide preparing for the upcoming tourist season, my constituents know what a long day's work looks like. In fact, many of my constituents work two jobs so they can put food on the table and a roof over their head and can save for their kid's college education. These folks don't wake up in the morning and say: Hey, I think I will take the year off and just sit it out. [[Page S2119]] That is why it is no surprise that when I went home for the March recess, Montanans were overwhelmingly disgusted with the majority's decision to refuse to do their job. Constituent after constituent asked me what the heck we were doing back here. Local editorial boards even chimed in. The Billings Gazette, my State's largest newspaper, tore the majority to shreds, saying that those who crow about making Washington work better are intentionally sabotaging the system, making it work worse. The Montana Standard, in ``Butte, America,'' accused Senators of ``shirking their constitutional responsibilities'' and denounced their tactics as ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.'' If that wasn't enough, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle described the crusade as ``nothing but an abdication of responsibility and another example of the kind of playground-level obstruction that has soured so many Americans on Congress and contributed to the divisive meltdown in the race to the GOP nomination for President.'' Now here we are. It has been 33 days since Judge Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court--33 days and counting. Yet there are no hearings in sight, no chance for the American people to have their voices heard through their elected representatives, no chance to ask tough questions of the nominee. This week we will hear the majority leader talk about regular order with respect to appropriations bills. But if regular order is good enough for appropriations bills, it is good enough for a Supreme Court nomination. The bottom line is this. The American people are as frustrated as I am. They are fed up with the obstructionism, and they want Congress to do its job. So let's have a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and then let's have a vote in the Senate. As the Montana Standard says, anything less than that is ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.'' I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in about 8 minutes we are going to start the vote on a motion for cloture, moving forward on the FAA bill. We have had a lot of debate about this. It passed with very little objection in the Commerce Committee. We have a package of 26 amendments, all of which have been cleared. We hope that can go as a separate amendment, almost like a managers' package. They are all noncontroversial. I am quite encouraged that we are making a number of reforms in the FAA that I have spoken about at length and that the chairman of the committee, Senator Thune, has spoken about at length. It is a good bill. Its previous adoption on a motion for cloture was something like 94 to 4. So you see where we are going. Then we will get into conference with the House, although it is my understanding they have not passed their bill. They passed it out of committee, but they have some controversial things. Hopefully, they will get it out, and we will be able to come to terms and get this reauthorization of the FAA, which we had to extend in a short-term reauthorization, because the clock is ticking. So I just wanted to share that with the Senate. Protecting the Manatee Now, Mr. President, since we have some time and no Senator is seeking recognition, I want to tell the Presiding Officer about a creature we have in Florida. We have lots of interesting creatures. There are things that come in that are like alien species, such as the Burmese python that they estimate--the Superintendent of Everglades National Park has estimated that there may be as many as 150,000. They got one 15-foot female, and she had 54 eggs in her. So you see how prolific they are. You cannot find them. The only way you can really find them is if there is a cold snap, because they will come out of the water, out of the river of grass where they are so exquisitely camouflaged. In a cold snap, they will come out of the water and up to the tree islands. Of course, you have seen some of those monsters--18 footers. Well, they had another critter that we have, because in Florida we do have alligators. Lo and behold, you may have seen this alligator. This alligator was 800 pounds and 15 feet long. He had been in a lake that was created in a cattle pasture, and he had been eating cows, so he had plenty of food. Well, this alligator, of course, is a critter that is native to Florida. It is the crocodile that is imported. You can tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile because the alligator has a rounded snout and the crocodile has a pointed one. All of this is to tell you we have another critter that is the most loveable critter, and we have had it on the endangered list. This is the animal called the manatee; some people call it a sea cow. These adorable creatures breathe air but live in the water. They have little flippers and a big body. Of course, they have these lovable faces. They have been endangered primarily because of boat propellers cutting them up. So we have had a serious effort at reducing the speeds of boats to a slow idle in manatee areas to protect them. They also get bothered by cold water. When there is a cold snap, they will migrate to warmer water. Pollution is another cause of the manatee being endangered. There has been a comeback. Around 20 years ago, there were only 1,200 of them in the world. That population has grown upward to 6,000. Here is the point: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to take them off the endangered list and put them into a lesser category. Those of us who want to protect these critters don't want them to come off the endangered list. If I had thought enough in advance, I would have brought a picture of a manatee. They are the most loveable critters. You can get in the water, you can swim with them, and you can feed them. When you feed them a pellet of food, they nibble like a horse nibbles sugar out of your hand--all of this under water. They are the most adorable critters. They love to be rubbed on their tummies. They love fresh water. In a brackish water system, where you can take a fresh water hose, they will come up and just drink the water, and then they will roll over so you can spray them underneath their flippers. Thank goodness they have rebounded, but there is a lot more to rebound. So, I wanted to share our crusade--our efforts to try to keep the manatee on the endangered list and to protect them. I yield the floor. Amendment No. 3680 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 3680 is agreed to. Amendment No. 3679, as Amended The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Texas Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Texas. This case is a challenge to President Obama's Executive actions to prioritize U.S. immigration enforcement. In 2012, the President used his legal authority to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA. DACA has given nearly 700,000 undocumented young people the opportunity to come out of the shadows to pursue their dreams through education and jobs. In 2014, again acting within existing legal authority, the President announced an expansion of the successful DACA Program. He also created a new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents Program, or DAPA. DAPA allows the undocumented parents of U.S.-born and legal permanent resident children, the majority of whom are U.S. citizens, to stay in this country with their families. Together, the expanded DACA and DAPA were expected to enable nearly 5 million people to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation. Unfortunately, Texas and 25 other States have challenged the President's authority to issue these Executive orders, resulting in the Supreme Court hearing today. Hundreds of DREAMers, Muslim students, and activists from California, New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere rallied on the Supreme Court steps this morning. I spoke with them and heard their stories and their hopes that the Supreme Court would make the right decision in support of the President and the millions of DACA and DAPA families. Many carried signs and stickers that read ``Keep families together.'' Keeping families together is at the crux of the President's Executive orders-- families like that of Gabriela Andrade, who, as a teenager, fled violence in Brazil and settled in Texas before coming to Hawaii. While Gabriela's sister and parents were granted visas through a lottery system, Gabriela fell through the cracks. Until President Obama announced the DACA Program, she lived in fear of being separated from her entire family. She said: DACA pulled me out of limbo and gave me a life again. It allowed me to go back to school to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science, to volunteer with several local organizations. Today, Gabriela is an advocate for DREAMers like herself. President Obama's DAPA and expanded DACA Programs would help thousands of families like Gabriela's who want to stay together and be contributing members of our communities without the daily fear of deportation. To tear undocumented parents away from their children and put these U.S.- born children in foster care is unconscionable. To deport people who were brought here when they were very young--to essentially tear them away from the United States, the only home and country they have known--is also unconscionable. These young people would be facing insurmountable odds, and I can certainly relate to some of the challenges they face. When I was almost 8 years old, my mother, brothers, and I legally immigrated to the United States. When we first arrived in Hawaii, we certainly struggled. I had to navigate the public school system without speaking a word of English. My mother worked low-paying jobs with no job security, and we struggled to make ends meet. But we took strength in being together as a family. However, in addition to facing the kind of challenges my whole family faced when we first arrived in this country, DACA and DAPA families live in constant fear that they will be ripped apart through deportation. These families and children have been living in limbo for over a year while the legal challenges work their way through the system, through the courts. In addition, United States v. Texas is also pushing DREAMers who are eligible for the original DACA Program, which is not being challenged, further into the shadows. Singai Masiya, who heads the Aloha DREAM Team in my home State and is a DREAMer himself, told my office that DACA-eligible people in Hawaii stopped applying for DACA. Why? They are afraid that if the Court rules against President Obama's Executive actions, their application information will be used to deport them. This is a real fear in our communities. United States v. Texas not only affects the lives of the more than 7,000 DACA- and DAPA-eligible Hawaii residents, it affects our economy. Over 10 years, DACA, DAPA, and expanded DACA are projected to provide a $276 million cumulative increase in Hawaii's State gross domestic product. The Center for American Progress also projects that, over 10 years, DACA, DAPA, and DACA expansion would provide a $136 million increase in the combined earnings of Hawaii's residents. However, in order to see these economic benefits, the Justices of the Supreme Court must rule on the side of DREAMers and the DAPA families. My hope is that the Supreme Court rules that the President is well within his legal authority in expanding DACA and DAPA and allows these Executive actions to be implemented. I note, however, that Executive actions, important as they are, are not enough. The President himself has called on Congress to fix our broken immigration system so that 11 million undocumented people in our country can come out of the shadows and live and work openly. It has been almost 3 years since the Senate passed bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform. I call upon Congress to do our jobs and enact fair, humane, and sensible immigration reform--recognizing that we are, indeed, a country of immigrants. That fact is at the very root of our strength as a nation. Mr. President, I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Order of Procedure Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, at 12 noon on Tuesday, April 19, the Senate vote on passage of H.R. 636, as amended; further, that following the disposition of H.R. 636, as amended, the Senate resume [[Page S2121]] consideration of S. 2012, the Energy Modernization Act, as under the previous order; that following disposition of S. 2012, as amended, if amended, but not prior to Wednesday, April 20, the cloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to H.R. 2028 be withdrawn and the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2028, the energy and water appropriations bill. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2110-S2121] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2015 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The minority whip. Immigration Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first thank the minority leader, Senator Reid, for his kind words about the DREAM Act, which I introduced 15 years ago. [[Page S2111]] This was a piece of legislation that came about because a mother called my office in Chicago. Here was her family story. She brought her two kids to America from Brazil. They actually started off in Korea, but they came through Brazil and came to Chicago--mother, father, and two kids. The father had the ambition of starting a church. There are a lot of Korean churches around Chicago and around the country, and his dream was to start a Korean-American Church. His dream never came true. He continued to pray and read the Bible, but he didn't work much. It was up to mom to go to work. She went to work in a dry-cleaning establishment in Chicago. If you have been around the great city I am honored to represent and go into a dry cleaners, most of the time Korean families are running them. They are working around-the-clock, and are the hardest working people imaginable. Mom went to work in the dry cleaners and the kids struggled because there wasn't much money coming in. One of their girls, Tereza, heard about a program in Chicago called the MERIT Music Program. It is a program that is available for low-income families of kids in public schools. The lady who left the money for it said to give them instruction in musical instruments and help them buy the instruments. Tereza Lee heard about this when she was a little girl and decided to sign up for it and to practice the piano. Well, guess what. She turned out to be a prodigy. She was amazing. For her the MERIT Music Program was like an opening to another part of the world she had never seen. She participated in recitals. Sometimes they told me they had to give her a key to the Merit music offices because she wanted to stay and practice until late at night. It was tough for her getting through high school. She tells the story, when she was interviewed in the local press, that sometimes she didn't have a lunch to take to school or any money to buy food. She would wait until the other kids left, and she would go through the wastebasket and look for food they had left behind. That is how tough it was. But because of her skill at playing the piano, she was given an opportunity. She was accepted into the Juilliard School for music in New York and at the Manhattan School of Music conservatory to pursue the piano. She was that good. When she and her mom started filling out the application, they reached that point where it said this: What is your nationality? What is your citizenship? Her mom said: Tereza, I don't know. We came here on a visitor's visa way back when you were 2 years old, but I never filed any papers for you. She said: Mom, what are we going to do? Her mom said: We are going to call Durbin's office. So they called the Senate office. We looked into it. The law in the United States was very clear for 17-year-old Tereza Lee. She had to leave the United States for 10 years and apply to come back in--leave for 10 years. She came here at the age of 2. She did not do anything wrong. She did everything right. She finished high school, against the odds. She developed a talent, against the odds. She was accepted at one of the best music schools in America, and our law very clearly said: Leave; we don't want you. If you want to try to come back in 10 years, that is your business. I don't think that is right. That is why 15 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act. It said: If you are one of those kids brought here under the age of 16, have finished high school, and have no serious criminal issues, we are going to give you a chance. Go to college or join the military and we will give you a path to ultimately getting to the back of the line but becoming a citizen of the United States--the DREAM Act. When I introduced this bill to solve Tereza Lee's problem, I used to give speeches about it all around Chicago. A funny thing would happen. When I would finish the speech and go back to my car, sometimes at night, there would be somebody waiting by my car. As I got closer, it turned out to be a very young girl, usually, maybe with her friend. They would wait to make sure no one was around. The young girl would say to me: Senator, I am one of those DREAMers. I am undocumented. My mom and dad are scared to death that they are going to be deported, and then I will be deported. I hope you can pass this. Well, time passed. We called the bill on the floor and called it in the House. We have never been able to make it the law of the land. Sadly, the reality is that there are probably 2.5 million young people living in America who would qualify under the DREAM Act to be given a chance to become legal--2.5 million. What happened to Tereza Lee? I have to finish that story. She ended up going to the Manhattan School of Music. Two families stepped forward--families that had befriended the Merit music program in Chicago. I know one of them well. They said: This girl is too good. We can't waste her talent. We will pay for her education. They did so out of pocket. She did not qualify for any Federal assistance because she is undocumented. So Tereza finished school and played in Carnegie Hall. Now she is about to complete her Ph.D. in music. She is living in Brooklyn, NY. She is a mom with a little girl. She married an American musician so she is legal--finally. That is her story. Thank goodness this determined young girl stuck with it. We have to stick with it too. The people who want to turn away these 2.5 million DREAMers ought to take a minute to meet them--just to meet them and to understand what it is to be a young person in America going through all the challenges of adolescence and all of the challenges that might be brought to you in your community or by our family and knowing in the back of your mind that at any moment, someone can knock on the door and tell you that you have to leave this country and that you are not here legally. They do it, and they fight every single day for a chance and a dream so that someday they will become part of the only country they have ever known. These are kids who, just like the Senate a few minutes ago, got up every day in the classroom and pledged allegiance to that flag, the only flag they have ever known. They do not view themselves as Mexican or Korean. They view themselves as Americans. The question is this: How do we view them? Do we view them as an asset to America or do we view them as a problem--a problem that should be thrown away and deported? You are listening to the Presidential campaign. We all are. I am not going to go into detail about some of the terrible things that have been said, but I just wish some of the haters, some of the people who want to turn on these young people, would meet them. Come and meet them. Hear their stories. I think even the hardest, coldest heart would be moved by them. Across the street--you can see it through the window--is the Supreme Court building. It was about 12 years ago that we decided to do something in the Senate that I thought was a great idea. Every 2 years, when there is a new class of Senators, we have a dinner with the Justices of the Supreme Court. We do it at their place. It is right across the street. We line up in the entryway there--the beautiful marble entryway. There are tables set up, each of us sits at a table with one of the Justices. I can remember one of the early times I went over there. I shared the table with another Senator, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a legendary Member of the Senate and former President pro tempore of the Senate. He served here for decades and carried the Constitution around in his breast pocket. In his great days he could recite poetry nonstop. He was a real believer in the Senate. He wrote the history of the Senate, one that probably will never be matched. I shared a table with him in the Supreme Court for one of these dinners. I said: Isn't this a beautiful building? He said: It sure is. I said: How often do you get over here, Senator Byrd? He said: This is my first time. I said: You have been in the Senate for 40-plus years, and this is your first time? Why? He said: Well, it is a separate branch of government. We must respect them. They had never asked me to come over. Well, I see it a little differently. I go across that street because, yes, it is a separate branch of government, but it [[Page S2112]] is one that we should understand and respect, as I hope they understand and respect Congress on this side of the street. So this morning I did. I went over for an argument before the Supreme Court. There was a huge mob out in front of the Supreme Court because the case that was being considered is one that affects millions of lives in America--Texas v. United States. The question is this: What are we going to do with people like Tereza Lee, whom I just described earlier. You see, what happened 6 years ago is that I joined with Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and wrote a letter to President Obama saying: If the Congress is not going to change the law to make it possible for these young people to stay in this country, would you issue an Executive order that allows them, at least on a temporary basis, to stay in the United States? Within a year or two, the President agreed to do it. He created what is known as the DACA Program. It basically says that young people like Tereza Lee, whom I described earlier, can step forward, identify themselves to our government, submit themselves for criminal investigation, and pay a filing fee of around $500, I believe it is. If they do, they will be given the right to stay in the United States on a temporary renewable basis for 2 years or 3 years. That is what DACA is all about--so that young people can pursue their lives at least with the understanding that for a few years, they don't have to worry about that knock on the door. Oh, if they get a job, they have to pay their taxes. If they go to college, they are not going to get a penny from this government. We don't help them pay for their college education. The President did it. I applauded him for doing it. So far, 700,000 young people just like Tereza Lee have signed up for protection under DACA. We estimate that the total universe of young people eligible is about 2.5 million. So the President attempted to extend the DACA Program. He said: We need to address the problem with their parents. Many of these parents have children who are U.S. citizens and legally in the United States, but they are undocumented and subject to deportation. So the President said, in what is known as DAPA: The parents of these kids can come forward, submit themselves to a criminal background check with fingerprints and all, pay a filing fee of around $500, and then they will be allowed, on a temporary, renewable basis, if they keep their noses clean, to work in this country. If they are going to work in this country, they have to pay their taxes. Well, that is what the President suggested. As soon as he made these two proposals to extend DACA and to create this other program for the parents, a lawsuit was filed. It was led by the State of Texas, and 25 other States, I believe, joined. That is the case before the Supreme Court today. Before I get into the details of that case--and I want to say a word about it on the floor this afternoon--let me say one other thing. What Senator Byrd told me about not going across the street was not only respect for that institution of the Supreme Court, but as a Senator he was basically saying that we need to respect their right to be above politics. We want to make certain that that branch of government is above politics, that they apply the law and interpret the Constitution in a nonpolitical way. Sometimes I read their decisions and think they have gone political on us. But the goal is to make sure they are preserved from becoming political. This morning, when I went before the Supreme Court, I did not face nine Justices, only eight. Antonin Scalia, who passed away a few weeks ago, created a vacancy that has not been filled. Why has the Senate failed to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court? Because within hours of the untimely death of Justice Scalia, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, who was here a few moments ago, announced publicly: We will not fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court. That is important to remember. It is the first time in the history of the United States of America--the first time in the history of the Senate--that the Senate is refusing a hearing for a Presidential nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has never happened before--never. Oh, the Republicans argue: Well, if the shoe were on the other foot, I am sure you Democrats would do exactly the same thing. I call their attention to the year 1988. Republican President Ronald Reagan, with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, submitted the name of Anthony Kennedy to the Senate. A Republican President was filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and he submitted the name of his nominee. The Senate, then controlled by the Democrats, gave Anthony Kennedy a hearing, a strong vote, and sent him over to the Supreme Court. So when the shoe was on the other foot, we did not play politics. But now we are. So I faced eight Justices over there as that argument was made this morning. I thought to myself: If they end up in a 4-to-4 tie--and that can happen--it will be chaos and confusion across America, with different courts and different districts having different interpretations of the same law. How did we get into this mess? Because the Republican majority in the Senate has decided: We are not going to appoint anyone to fill this vacancy. Their argument is this: Let the American people speak to filling this vacancy in the Presidential election. Let them decide whether it will be a Democrat or a Republican President filling this vacancy. There might be some value to that argument if President Obama, in the last election, when he was running for reelection in 2012, had been running for a term of 3 years. You can argue then that this fourth year he was not entitled to be President. But you know what. It turns out that he was running for a 4-year term. It turns out he won by 5 million votes. It turns out that when it comes to being Commander in Chief and President of the United States, he has all the powers vested in him by the Constitution, even in the fourth year. Isn't that amazing--4 years as the President? That is what the American people decided, but only to be overruled by the Republican majority in the Senate. Sorry, Mr. President, they say, you only get 3 years. Maybe we give you 3 years and 2 months, but you sure don't have the right to try and fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, even though the Constitution explicitly says in article II, section 2: The President shall appoint a nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Their argument is that you may think you are President when it comes to the Supreme Court, but the Senate Republican majority thinks otherwise. I sat down with Merrick Garland. He is the proposed nominee to fill this vacancy. He is chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, which is a high position in the judiciary. He was born in Illinois, so I come to his nomination with some prejudice, but he is an extraordinary person. People have said: Well, why didn't the President choose a woman? Why didn't the President choose an African American? Why didn't he choose a Hispanic? Why didn't he choose someone from India? Why did he choose this man? I think he chose him for an obvious reason: He is clearly qualified. Even Republican Senators have said nice things about him publicly. Many of them have said they refuse to even meet with him, will not even sit in the same room with him. Some have agreed to, but many have said no. Senator McConnell said: I won't meet with him because he is not going to get a hearing and he is not going to get a vote. It is time for us to fill that vacancy. It is time for us to accept our constitutional responsibility and show respect for the document we all swore to uphold and defend when we took the oath of office. It is time to fill that vacancy and put nine Justices on the Supreme Court to avoid the uncertainty, confusion, and chaos which might otherwise emerge. I wish to say a word about the case before the Court this morning. This was a case--United States v. Texas--a legal challenge, as I mentioned earlier, to the President's immigration policy, filed by 26 Republican Governors. I believe this lawsuit has no legal merit. It is driven by political hostility toward President Obama and his immigration policy. I was proud to join an amicus brief signed by 39 Senators on our side of the aisle and 186 House Democrats in support of the administration's decision [[Page S2113]] on immigration. The President is on very solid ground in this case. I am hoping and confident that the Supreme Court will rule in his favor. As an initial matter before the case proceeds, the States that filed this lawsuit have to show they will be harmed by the President's immigration policy. Otherwise, they really don't have any standing to sue. It turns out that exactly the opposite is true. The President's policy allowing people to work here on a temporary basis under his Executive orders will create a huge benefit to the American economy. Over the next 10 years, in the State of Texas alone--and they brought the lawsuit; at least started it--the President's immigration action would increase that State's gross domestic product by more than $38 billion and increase the earnings of all Texas residents by $17.5 billion. They argue that the President's immigration policy would cost the State of Texas money. It turns out that exactly the opposite is true. Even if the States have standing to sue, the Supreme Court repeatedly has held that the Federal Government has broad authority to decide questions of immigration. Justice Anthony Kennedy, appointed earlier, wrote the opinion for the Court striking down Arizona's controversial immigration law. Listen to what he said: A principal feature of the removal system-- Removal of people who are not eligible to be in the United States-- is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials. . . . Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime. This administration's immigration policy is not just legal, it is smart and realistic. The President has said simply: We should prioritize. We have limited resources. We can't deport all those who are here undocumented. If we are only going to deport some, let's pick those who are a danger to the United States. The President has focused on those who have been convicted of serious crimes or pose a threat to our security. And shouldn't he? As Commander in Chief, shouldn't that be his highest priority, to make sure anyone who is a danger to the United States is gone? He knows he can't deport all even if he wished to, so he focuses on those who may be a danger to the United States--prosecutorial discretion. The Department of Homeland Security only has enough funding to deport a small fraction of undocumented, so the President wants to focus the limited resources on those who could do us harm. That is just common sense. At the same time, the President said that we should not waste our resources on deporting young immigrant students who grow up in this country, such as Tereza Lee, whom I mentioned earlier, or tear apart families by deporting the parents of U.S. citizens. The President's policy is focused on deporting felons, not families--criminals, not children. In November of 2014, President Obama established this program, DAPA, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents. Under DAPA, undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for more than 5 years and have American children would be required to come forward, register with the government, pay a fee, go through a criminal background check and a national security background check, and pay their taxes. If the government determines these parents have not committed any serious crimes and don't pose any threat, this Executive order says: On a temporary, renewable basis, they will not be targeted for deportation. President Obama also expanded the DACA Program for children, as I mentioned earlier, at the same time. Why did he do that? Because for years Republicans in Congress have refused to consider legislation to fix our broken immigration system. On the floor of the Senate on June 27, 2013, I joined a group of seven other Senators--four Democrats and four Republicans in total. We had worked for months to construct a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill. We had to give a lot. There were things in that bill which I didn't like at all and things which some of the Republican Senators didn't like, but it is the nature of legislation and compromise that that happens. We brought the bill to the floor for a vote after a lengthy markup in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and dozens of amendments had been offered. The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation on June 27, 2013, 68 to 32--more than 2 to 1. That bill would have strengthened border security, protected American workers, and established a tough but fair path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who were then currently living in our country. What happened to the bill after it passed the Senate? I take you back to how laws are made and your civics course. It went across the Rotunda to the House of Representatives, which was under Republican control. The majority in the House of Representatives refused to call the bill, refused to even bring it to the floor for a debate, and refused to offer any substitute. They did nothing--nothing, despite our broken immigration system. In the face of this, the President was left with no choice. For the good of the American people, he used the authority given him as President to try to make some reforms to our immigration system. The Center for American Progress has studied what the President proposed, and they say that over the next 10 years, if these two programs--DACA and DAPA--were passed, the gross domestic product for my home State of Illinois would increase by $15 billion and the earnings of Illinois residents would increase by almost $8 billion. Could your State use that--more economic activity, more people paying taxes to the Federal Government and to your State? Virtually every State could use that. It is unfortunate that these bills have been blocked by the Senate, and now they are trying to block them in the Supreme Court. I see Senator Cornyn is on the floor, and I will close by telling a story about another DREAMer. I have done this quite a few times. My staff has done a lot of work on it. I thank them all for it. These stories really say a lot more than I ever could in a speech. They tell us what was at stake before the Supreme Court of the United States this morning. This attractive young woman is Vasthy Lamadrid. Her family came to the United States from Mexico. She was 5 years old. They came here with nothing. They moved into a home with four other families, so a lot of the kids slept in the same room. Despite their poverty, Vasthy felt safe and excelled in school. Math was her best subject. She had nearly perfect scores on standardized tests. English was tough, but then she discovered a series of books called ``Goosebumps.'' If you have kids or grandkids, I bet you have heard of that one. She became an avid reader and mastered the English language. By middle school, Vasthy was placed in the gifted program. That is where she discovered her love of engineering. She was a student in the Engineering Pathway at Bioscience High School, where she received the Young Entrepreneurs Award, made the principal's list every semester, and played tennis. She was an active volunteer, working with such groups as Girls For Change, CompuGirls, E-Tech, Hospice of the Valley, and St. Joseph's Hospital. Vasthy also helped younger kids in her neighborhood by tutoring them in math and tennis. Vasthy went on to attend Arizona State University. Because she is undocumented, she didn't qualify for a penny of government assistance, and she had to pay out-of-State tuition despite the fact that she had lived her entire life in the United States, in Arizona. Then something extraordinary happened. Counting on the generosity of the American people, Vasthy decided to crowdfund her college education. She shared her life story online and asked people to contribute to help her pay her tuition. Well, it worked. She is currently in her second year of college. In the first semester, she made the dean's list with a 3.79 GPA in the Ira Fulton School of Engineering. Thanks to DACA--the Presidential Executive order--she is able to support herself. She has also made time to continue to volunteer for a club called [[Page S2114]] STEM Academy mentoring young children. She volunteers with the Arizona Immigration Refugee Service as an English teacher. As a result of her volunteer work, she has decided she wants to become a science teacher. Can we use more science teachers in America? You bet. This is what she said in a letter she wrote: DACA signifies to me a chance to show that I belong here-- that inside I am an American. It represents an opportunity to show that my parents' sacrifice was worth it. I love this country and want to one day become a citizen and continue to give back to the community. I don't need that journey to become a citizen to be easily given to me, but I'd hope that the journey is fair. Vasthy and other DREAMers have so much they can give to America. I don't understand the Republican Party when it comes to the issue of immigration. We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country. I am a first-generation American and proud of it. It is my honor to serve and represent a great State like Illinois. I know what her journey was like. She was brought here at the age of 2 from Lithuania. I know what her early life was like as she struggled to try to make sure there was food on the table, first for her mom, sister, and brother, and then ultimately for her own family. That is my family's story, but it is a story that is repeated over and over again. There is something in the DNA of immigrants who are willing to risk everything in this world to go to a country where they don't even speak the language because they know they will have an opportunity here, and they bring something with them. That is why they light up the scoreboard in Silicon Valley with all of these new inventions and new corporations with thousands of employees that make us an economic success in many fields. That is why we should think twice about those who condemn immigrants in this Nation of immigrants. I am confident the Supreme Court will uphold the President's immigration actions. Then I hope, after they have done this, that the Republicans in Congress will finally decide to return to the table and work on a bipartisan basis for comprehensive immigration reform. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip is recognized. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am always impressed with the distinguished Democratic whip and his eloquence, but he is telling the American people that we have to choose between being a nation of immigrants or a nation of laws. The fact is, we don't have to make that choice; we can be both. But we can't do it when we have a President who simply believes he can do an end run around the U.S. Constitution. In fact, according to Pew, about 3.5 million people could claim the benefits of the President's unlawful Executive action, receiving work permits, driver's licenses, and Social Security numbers. While we are a compassionate country, we are a nation of immigrants, that is not the kind of decision the Constitution gives to a single political actor, even if he is the President of the United States. So there is a right way and a wrong way. And I realize the distinguished Democratic whip believes that just because they can't get what they want when they want it, the President can then resort to this end run, but thankfully that is not the view of the courts. The U.S. Federal district court in Brownsville, TX, issued an injunction against the President's Executive action. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that injunction, and now the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments in the case this afternoon. This is really more than just about immigration. This is whether, under the doctrine of separation of powers, the Constitution we have lived under for lo these many years gives the President unilateral authority without the approval of Congress, the elected representatives of the people, and in flagrant disregard for the laws that are already on the books. The heart of the case the Court heard today is about stopping a President who said: I have a pen and I have a phone. And even though the American people have given Republicans a majority in both Houses and obviously forced the President to deal with a Republican conference to come up with consensus legislation, the President said: Forget that. I am not about trying to achieve bipartisan consensus on anything. If I don't get what I want, I am going to jam it through the system and hope the courts don't stop me. So it is not just about immigration, it is about the Constitution itself. There are perhaps 22 different times, by my count, where the President of the United States acknowledged he didn't even have this authority. I remember in a speech he gave to La Raza, an interview he gave on Univision, the President denied he had the authority, which now, miraculously, our Democratic friends think is clear-cut under the law. How can that be? It cannot be. I remember specifically being at a meeting where the President invited the leadership of both the House and the Senate to the White House after the 2014 election. Many may recall that leading up to that point, there had been a lot of rumors about the President issuing an Executive action, but he had not done so. I remember specifically sitting there in the White House with some of my colleagues from the House and the Senate, where then-Speaker Boehner said to the President: Please, Mr. President, don't do this. Don't poison the well. Don't make it impossible, by such a polarizing action, for us to build consensus on the building blocks of immigration reform where we could actually agree. I remember Majority Leader McCarthy making the same comment. I joined in and reiterated the same point. The President, defiant, told us he was going to go ahead and do it. There are a lot of conversations people are having today across the United States. I had some of those earlier today during some visits with people who were just wondering how to explain the political environment in America today. What I tell them is that this seems unprecedented in my experience. People are so angry. People are so scared. People are frightened and worried about the next generation. And for the first time in my memory, parents are doubting whether their children will enjoy the same sorts of freedom and prosperity that we enjoy today. That is a tragedy. My parents were part of the ``greatest generation.'' My dad was a B- 17 pilot in the Army Air Corps, even before the Air Force came into being. On his 26th bombing mission over Nazi Germany, while he was flying in the 8th Air Force out of Molesworth, England, he was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war for 4 months. Fortunately, that was toward the tail end of the war. Even though he was injured in his parachute jump--not seriously, as it turned out, although he had some disability associated with that later in life--he managed to survive that and even survived an appendectomy by a fellow prisoner of war when he had appendicitis in a POW camp. It is amazing. I always thought my dad had nine lives. Even though he passed away at the very young age of 67, he survived countless occasions when surely he could have lost his life, including those occasions of jumping out of a burning B-17 plane over Germany and an appendectomy in a POW camp at the hands of a fellow prisoner of war. The reason my parents and all of our parents sacrificed so much and risked so much and worked so hard is that they believed in the promise of America--the promise that exists only when the law is respected, when people in high office are bound by and obligated to and held accountable to the same laws that govern the most humble among us. That is what America is all about--a country where people, if they work hard and play by the rules, can achieve their dreams. I think that is the reason America seems so polarized today. People have sort of jumped outside the usual paradigm of political calculation where you are a liberal or you are a conservative or you are somewhere in the middle. People have sort of jumped that track, and we are seeing something entirely different on the left and on the right. I think the reason is, in part, because of a President who believes he is not bound by the Constitution and laws of the United States. People are frightened because they have seen over the last 7 years-- even though the President was stopped legislatively after the Affordable Care Act [[Page S2115]] was passed and after Dodd-Frank was passed and then stopped by the electorate giving the Republicans a majority in the House and in 2014 a majority in Senate--that this President will not be stopped by the voters. That is the determination he made, and this Executive order is exhibit 1 because he said: I don't care what the voters think. I don't care what the American people think. I don't care what the Constitution says. I don't care that what Congress says should be the law of the land. I am going to do it the way I want to do it. Frankly, that is scary stuff when you are talking about the Commander in Chief, the leader of the free world, and the sort of power that goes along with that. Rather than heed the warning--or I would really call it the plea of leaders in the House and the Senate after the 2014 election--the President decided to go around Congress and try to essentially change the law, giving work permits to people who were illegally present in the country, giving them driver's licenses, even giving Social Security numbers to an estimated 3.5 million people. How can the President do this when Congress is deadlocked? Well, he did it. And that is a question the Supreme Court is going to have to decide. At the time, the President called it a middle-ground approach. He is a master of rhetoric. The problem is the facts belie his words. The fact of the matter is this was a constitutional scorched-earth tactic. And more than anything else, it eroded public confidence in Congress's ability, working with the White House, to get anything constructive done in the area of immigration. The Acting President pro tempore is, of course, from the great State of Oklahoma, and he went to school in Texas. He understands what I understand: We have a large Hispanic population in Texas--about 38 percent. But we are a very diverse State. Many people are surprised when I tell them the third most commonly spoken language in Texas today is Vietnamese--Vietnamese. Can you believe that? We also have a large Indian American population. We are a very diverse State, and the main reason for that is we still represent that land of opportunity that America used to be, where people can come, work hard--those of modest means, with little on their backs and maybe nothing in their pockets--and achieve something and live the American dream. So I resent, I really do resent, the distinguished Senator from Illinois trying to tell us the President was only trying to do something that was good for Texas. He doesn't have a clue. In fact, if we were to follow the policy choices of the leadership in Texas, the country would be a heck of a lot better off when it comes to taking advantage of our energy resources, when it comes to taxes, reasonable regulation, and a willingness to try to accommodate those who invest capital and create jobs. To me, that is the single biggest difference between where I live in Texas and what I see across our country and what is coming out of Washington, DC. There seems to be an attitude here in Washington of how many more obstacles, how many larger impediments can we place in the way of those who invest the capital and those who are creating the jobs and still expect the American dream to be alive. Believe me, we have tested it. The Obama administration has tested it, and what it has produced is disaster. It has produced a health care system that, rather than making health care more affordable, has made it more expensive, has caused people who liked their coverage to give up their coverage only to buy something that had a deductible that has, in essence, made them self-insured. It has created stagnant wages. It has created stagnant economic growth. There are not a lot of problems we have in this country that couldn't be mitigated, made better, if we just saw our economy growing again, instead of the sort of anemic and flatlined growth we have seen since 2008. My predecessor in the Senate, Mr. Phil Gramm, has a Ph.D. in economics from Texas A&M University. He has made the point that, historically, what you see after a recession like the one we saw following the fiscal crisis in 2008 is a V-shape recovery. In other words, you hit the bottom and you bounce up and you grow quickly because basically you have worked the problems out of the system. But what we have seen since 2008 is a U-shaped recovery, if you could even call it that. It is pretty close to flat, where the economy is growing at less than 2 percent, which is not fast enough to keep people fully employed. And we still have--although the unemployment rate has dropped down, we still have the smallest percentage of people participating in the workforce that we have had in the last 30 years. Many people have simply given up, retired early, or made other arrangements. This is a serious matter. The Supreme Court heard arguments today. We know there are currently eight members of the Supreme Court. I heard the distinguished Democratic whip complain about the fact that we have decided to allow the voters to choose in November the President who will make the choice to fill the Scalia vacancy. Well, the fact of the matter is, it is simply too important to allow President Obama, given his penchant for lawlessness and usurpation of constitutional authority--to give him the chance to stack the Supreme Court in favor of a Court that would likely rubberstamp his actions and those of future Presidents for the next 25 years. The hypocrisy is rich, listening to our Democratic colleagues. These are the folks who invented the judicial filibuster. They invented the judicial filibuster. They did that when President George W. Bush was President. As controversial as the nomination of Clarence Thomas was, I believe he was confirmed with 52 votes--not 60 votes but 52 because nobody dreamed back then that Senate rules would allow the minority party to insist on 60 votes to confirm a President's appointee. We know that after the election where the Democratic majority lost that majority, in a lameduck session they jammed a number of appointees onto the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in an effort to pack that court to match the ideological picture they wanted. Again, this is the second most important court in the Nation, which they believed would be more inclined to rubberstamp the overreaching by the Obama administration. We are all familiar with the Biden speech in 1992 when, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he suggested it would be perhaps inappropriate to confirm a Presidential nominee in the waning days of that President's term. We saw the Harry Reid speech in 2005, where he said it is the President's prerogative to appoint, but the Senate is not obligated to grant consent to that nomination. Actually, I agree with Senator Reid back then, but not today, when he has taken the exact opposite approach. Then there is Senator Schumer, the heir apparent to the Democratic leadership in the Senate, who said, in 2007, 18 months before George W. Bush left office: I think there ought to be a presumption against confirmation. To listen to my Democratic colleagues complain about the decision we have made to let the voters vote for the President who is going to fill that vacancy and to watch them--well, it looks like crocodile tears to me, and it smells like hypocrisy. As we have said, the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments today in a case brought by the State of Texas and other States that would otherwise be compelled to grant work permits, issue driver's licenses and Social Security numbers to people illegally present in the United States who did not comply with our laws. I am confident the Court will find that the States have suffered real harm from the standpoint of the constitutional notion of standing; in other words, you have to have standing before you can sue. Basically, it means you have to show real or potential harm if the Court doesn't act. I am confident the Court will find standing. But the Court will do one of two things. Either the Court will affirm by being split 4 to 4 or all eight Justices could write in favor of the Fifth Circuit decision to let the injunction stand or, if the Court deems that this issue needs to be held over until the Court has all nine members, after the first of the year, that is a decision the Court can make. This is a very important issue, and I am glad the Court is taking it up. We [[Page S2116]] need to know--we need to know whether we remain a nation of laws as well as a nation of immigrants. The whole idea our Democratic colleagues have foisted on us that somehow we have to choose between those two is a false choice. It is a false choice. We are both. We aren't one or the other. America has always been made better by people who have risked coming to the United States because they weren't satisfied with what they had or where they lived, but the day we begin rewarding people who do this in disregard of the laws is the day we begin to no longer be a nation of laws, and that is a legacy and a treasure we should not squander. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Nebraska. Tax Reform Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to discuss an issue of importance for Nebraskans and Americans all across this country; that is, the need for comprehensive tax reform. It is no secret the current Tax Code is overly complex and outdated. Any American can tell you how frustrating it is to file a tax return. Our Tax Code is riddled with deductions, exemptions, credits, exclusions, preferences, and loopholes that make it nearly impossible for anyone without a degree in tax law to understand. At the same time, we should recognize that some progress has been made. Thanks to the work of Chairman Hatch and members of the Senate Finance Committee, many important updates to the Tax Code were made permanent at the end of last year. In particular, increasing the deduction limit and making permanent section 179 of the Tax Code was an important step. This section allows small businesses to deduct from their taxes certain depreciable business assets. My constituents told me annual uncertainty about whether section 179 would be renewed made it very difficult for them to plan, to invest, and to grow their businesses. Making this provision permanent reduced the ambiguity that had plagued Nebraska's small business owners and operators. Although we have made some progress in reforming the Tax Code, there is more work to do for the American people. I believe tax reform should focus on several principles, including competitiveness, simplicity, and economic growth. At nearly 40 percent, the United States has the highest combined corporate tax rate in the developed world. This is stifling job growth, hurting families, and compelling businesses to move overseas. Any comprehensive plan should seek to lower this rate to a competitive level, one that will not only encourage current businesses to stay but also incentivize new businesses to set up shop. Another goal of comprehensive tax reform should be to simplify the Tax Code. Families and businesses spend billions of hours every year in completing their taxes. A disproportionate share of this burden is shouldered by many small businesses. Many of these are family businesses, and they don't have the resources to easily comply. Creating a tax system that is simple and efficient will reduce administrative and compliance costs. A simple tax system will also increase transparency, allowing Americans to fill out their taxes accurately while preventing fraud and lost revenue. Perhaps most importantly, any plan to reform the Tax Code--well, it must spur economic growth. Inaction on reforming the Tax Code is delaying needed growth in GDP, jobs, and investment. When I was first elected to the Senate, I thought my colleagues and I would immediately take up two issues to restart our economy, grow jobs, and help all American families: tax reform and reducing the overburden of government regulations. After all, it is pretty obvious these are two issues we can reform that would have a positive impact on our economy. We see regulations become ever more burdensome, and they continue to depress our economy, stifle innovation, and hurt our families. Major tax reform has not happened. We continue to chip away, but I believe now is the time we step up and be bolder. We must make the necessary reforms to our tax system to give Americans confidence in our future. We need to help put more money back in the pockets of hardworking Americans and allow them to spend money on the goods and services they choose and that they need. It is my hope my colleagues will join me in continuing this discussion and that this dialogue then will eventually result in action, in comprehensive tax reform that truly benefits Nebraskans and the American people. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. China's Aluminum Industry Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, over the last few decades, China has used market-distorting subsidies and industrial policies to repeatedly prop up their own industries and rip off American jobs. Steel, tires, solar panels--the story plays out again and again. Too often China's economy is not run by the markets; it is run by government committee. So even though its own State Council has called out the problem of severe excess capacities, China clings to the same old tired and destructive policies. Today I want to address what is happening now with China's huge overcapacity of aluminum. The amount of aluminum Chinese smelters are churning out has gone up by more than 1,200 percent in a decade and a half. In 2000, they produced 2.5 million metric tons. In 2015 China produced 32 million metric tons. When you create a glut of aluminum production the way China has, you send the markets into turmoil and you do enormous harm to American workers. I spoke last week at a public hearing held by the U.S. Trade Representative and the International Trade Commission about how the overproduction of steel in China is an urgent and immediate threat to steel jobs here in our country. While China's steel mills are churning out more steel than ever, American steel towns are suffering or worse. Thousands of jobs nationwide have been lost just in the last year. Even though one-third of all steel produced today has no buyer, China keeps adding and adding to the glut by producing more steel. The same story is played out in the case of primary aluminum. There is a huge overcapacity in China that, once again, is driven by market- distorting government policies. It has unleashed a chain of events that can end in economic devastation across this country. Global aluminum prices have already plummeted, undercutting our American companies. Between the start of 2011 and this upcoming June, the lights will have gone out at nearly two-thirds of the aluminum smelters in the United States. More than 6,500 jobs--good American jobs--will have been lost. You can bet that sooner or later the damage will ripple downstream through the entire aluminum industry, which employs three-quarters of a million Americans either directly or indirectly. In my judgment, the United States is badly in need of a safeguard against this economic tidal wave. That is why I have chosen to stand with my friend Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, and the steelworkers. They filed a petition for relief under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 today. Without an immediate economic bulwark, the United States is in danger of losing thousands of good family-wage jobs across our country. It is my view that the administration should act in this case as soon as possible to defend our workers and our businesses from economic ruin. The United States and our trading partners must ramp up the pressure on China to stop overproduction, and our trade enforcers have to take on the trade cheats and use every single trade tool in the toolbox, including the ENFORCE Act, the Leveling the Playing Field Act, and the other measures my colleagues and I on the Finance Committee fought to get signed into law over the last year. I firmly believe workers in Oregon and across this country can compete with anybody in the world, but the United States cannot afford to sit idly by and watch China's destructive policies cause our aluminum industry to be wiped out. As the steelworkers have pointed out repeatedly, enough is [[Page S2117]] enough. Leo Gerard and those steelworkers are standing up and fighting back, and I am honored to stand with them. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in a few moments, we will be voting on ending debate on H.R. 636, and that will allow us to proceed to a vote on the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016. I wish to urge my colleagues to support that motion to end debate. The legislation we are considering is not just any FAA reauthorization. This bill is the most pro-passenger and pro-security FAA reauthorization in recent history. Travelers are frustrated, and this bill contains commonsense reforms to make travel safe and secure and more passenger-friendly. For over 2 weeks on the Senate floor now and before that in the Commerce Committee, where I serve as chairman, we have been working hard to thoughtfully develop this bill and to allow for robust debate. For instance, there are drone safety provisions in the bill, including a pilot program to deploy technology to intercept drones near airports. These provisions are obviously intended to prevent accidents like the one that happened outside the Heathrow Airport this weekend, where a drone hit an approaching plane. We developed this provision and others in the bill through an open process that allowed every member of the committee to contribute and help write the bill. Last year, we held six hearings on topics that helped inform our bill, and at the committee markup last month alone, we accepted 57 amendments, 34 of which were sponsored by Democrats and 23 by Republicans. On the Senate floor, when it was reported out and taken up, we added 19 amendments, 10 from Democrats and 9 from Republican Senators. The resulting bill is one we can be proud of, and both sides of the aisle have commended us for our inclusive process. When there have been differences, we have been able to find ways to address or set those aside for later so the progress on the legislation could move forward. Even at this late hour, we have worked constructively to assemble a possible managers' package of more than two dozen additional amendments that we would like to adopt by voice vote prior to final passage. Yet, even if that is not possible, I commit to those Senators whose amendments we stand prepared to accept that I will work to address their concerns as we engage with our colleagues in the House of Representatives. Now it is time to conclude our work on the bipartisan FAA bill that I introduced a long ways back, along with my friend and ranking member, Senator Bill Nelson, and our Aviation Subcommittee leaders, Senators Kelly Ayotte and Maria Cantwell. The bill includes reforms benefiting the traveling public, and we shouldn't let them down. Let's vote yes on the motion to end debate and start moving these historic reforms forward. As I mentioned, I have a list of 26 amendments that we would like to clear--amendments offered by both sides. It is a package we could adopt. We have a couple of objections to doing that. If the Members who have put forward those objections would be willing to release those objections, we would be able to get another 26 amendments adopted, many of which have been offered by colleagues, as I said, on both sides and many of which contain measures that I think will make the bill even stronger and make it a product we can all be proud of as it moves over to the House of Representatives. There, I hope it will receive consideration and action and ultimately end up on the President's desk. The FAA bill is legislation we have to do on a fairly routine basis around here. This authorization will stand for about 18 months. There are a number of important considerations that need to be addressed that this bill not only acknowledges but addresses. As I mentioned, those considerations have to do with drone safety, which is an increasingly important issue in our economy and one where we need to make sure we have the right rules of the air, if you will, in place so that we preserve and ensure that safety is the No. 1 factor as we continue to see the increased research, development, and deployment of drone technologies in ways that have tremendous commercial application. As I said, it also includes a lot of passenger protections which are very consumer-friendly in terms of passengers who travel on a regular basis with the airlines. So those are things as well that we need to address in this legislation. We enhanced the bill by amendment when it came to the floor with a couple of safety provisions that we think are critically important, particularly in light of what has happened of late with the attack in Brussels and a number of other attacks we have seen, where we have had aviation insiders involved, if you will--particularly the Metrojet airliner that crashed not that long ago and killed 224 people. There are a number of safety provisions that help address some of those concerns. As I said, we expand the TSA precheck program to limit the number of people who are in areas outside secure areas--outside the perimeter, so to speak--where they are more vulnerable to these types of attacks. These are all included in this legislation. So from an aviation security standpoint, this bill includes the most comprehensive security measures we will have adopted in nearly a decade. As I said before, from a passenger-friendly standpoint, according to a columnist at the Washington Post, this is one of the most passenger-friendly FAA reauthorization bills we have seen literally in a generation. So these are reasons why this bill needs to move forward. I hope my colleagues here in the Senate, when the vote comes here in a few minutes, will cast a vote in support of ending debate and allow us to move forward to a vote on final passage, which will enable this legislation to move forward to the House of Representatives and I hope ultimately to the President so he can sign it into law and put many of these provisions in place that would be good for our country. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Immigration Enforcement Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today, I wish to pay tribute to Sarah Root, a young woman from Iowa who just graduated from college with perfect grades. She was devoted to her family and friends and had a bright future, but she was taken from this earth too soon. I want to express my sympathies to Sarah's parents and acknowledge Michelle Root, Sarah's mother, who is watching today. She will be testifying tomorrow before the House Committee on the Judiciary at a hearing titled, ``The Real Victims of a Reckless and Lawless Immigration Policy: Families and Survivors Speak Out on the Real Cost of This Administration's Policies.'' The hearing will focus on how the Obama administration's failed immigration policies allow thousands of criminal aliens to roam free. Michelle Root will share her personal story about the loss of her daughter and how someone in the country illegally was able to walk free and abscond from authorities after fatally hitting her daughter's vehicle on graduation night. Sarah was 21 years old and had just graduated from Bellevue University with an interest in pursuing a career in criminal justice. In the words of her family, ``she was full of life and ready to take on the world.'' According to a close friend of hers, Sarah was smart, outgoing, and dedicated to her friends and family. She embodied the words: ``live, laugh, love.'' The day Sarah graduated, she was struck by a drunk driver in the country illegally. The alleged drunk driver was Edwin Mejia, who had a blood alcohol [[Page S2118]] content of more than three times the legal limit. The driver was charged with felony motor vehicle homicide and operating a vehicle while intoxicated on February 3. Bail was set at $50,000, but he was only required to put up 10 percent. So, for a mere $5,000, the drunk driver walked out of jail and into the shadows. This case has shed light on the breakdown between the Federal Government and State and locals. It has also been a terrible example of why the President's policies don't work, and how they are having a dire effect on American families like the Root family. Under President Obama's Priority Enforcement Program, a person in the country illegally will only be detained or removed in a few limited circumstances. The administration hides behind these so-called ``priorities'' to ensure that a vast majority of people in the country are not removed. Some say that nearly 90,000 illegal immigrant criminals were released in 2015 because of this policy. The administration's polices result in tragedies like Sarah's. A smart young lady who had a bright future was struck by a drunk driver who entered the country illegally, and was turned over to a brother who was also in the country illegally, while awaiting his immigration court date. After the accident, local law enforcement apparently asked the Federal government--specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement--to take custody of the driver, but the Federal government declined. ICE refused to place a detainer on him. An ICE spokesman stated that the agency did not lodge a detainer on the man because his arrest for felony motor vehicle homicide ``did not meet ICE's enforcement priorities.'' The driver made bond and absconded, never showing up for his hearings and required drug tests. It is difficult for the family to have closure since the man is nowhere to be found. It is unknown if he is still in the United States or if he has fled to his home country of Honduras. Sarah Root is one of many victims who have been harmed or killed because of lax immigration enforcement and the notion that drunk driving isn't always a public safety threat. Even though this tragic accident happened in the heartland of America, this is a border security problem. The driver of the vehicle that killed Sarah entered the country illegally. Every day, people are illegally entering the country, being removed, entering again, and committing more crimes. Illegal re-entries are happening because there are no consequences. That is what happened in Kate Steinle's death. And, that is why we need to move on Kate's law. That bill would deter people from illegally re-entering by enhancing penalties and establishing new mandatory minimum sentences for certain individuals with previous felony convictions. The Obama administration cannot continue to turn a blind eye to drunk drivers, sanctuary communities, and people who ignore our laws, overstay their visas, or cross the border time and again. I am still waiting for answers from the Obama administration on this case, and many more. There are many unanswered questions. How many more people have to die? How many more women and young people are going to be taken from their family and friends? Things have got to change. The President must rethink his policies and must find a way to ensure that criminal immigrants are taken off the streets. The Obama administration should try enforcing the law, instead of its priorities, for the sake of the American people. I want to wish Michelle Root the best of luck while she is in Washington this week, and send my thoughts to her father who is trying to find justice back home. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Ohio. Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the sentiments shared by our senior Senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley. Tomorrow morning, one of my constituents, Michelle Root, will be testifying before the House Judiciary Committee about the loss of her beautiful young daughter, Sarah Root. As a mother of three daughters myself, I cannot begin to fathom the pain and anguish Mrs. Root is experiencing. Earlier this year, 21-year-old Sarah Root was killed by a drunk driver. That driver, Edwin Mejia, was allegedly drag racing with a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit when he crashed into the back of Sarah's vehicle. Edwin Mejia is also an illegal immigrant. After causing the death of an American citizen and being charged with motor vehicle homicide, one would think he would clearly meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's so-called enforcement priorities. But no, citing the administration's November 2014 memo on immigration enforcement priorities, ICE declined to lodge a detainer and take custody of Mejia. During a recent Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, ICE Director Sarah Saldana actually suggested that ICE neglected to issue a detainer because at the time they were contacted, Sarah Root was seriously injured, not dead. How twisted and convoluted has our immigration system become that an illegal immigrant who, while driving drunk and drag racing, hits and either seriously injures or kills an American citizen is not considered a priority for deportation? In fact, only after a floor speech, multiple letters, and hearing questions from Senators from Nebraska and Iowa, as well as media attention and concerns raised by the Root family, did ICE finally acknowledge that they should have taken Mejia into custody. It should not take all of those actions for ICE to determine that an illegal immigrant who kills an American citizen should be removed from our country. Tragically, after ICE declined to file a detainer against Mejia, he posted a $5,000 bond, was released, and has since disappeared. This is so despite the fact that he had a history of skipping court dates related to prior driving offenses. A few weeks ago, I spoke with Sarah's dad, who told me that before they could even lay their daughter to rest, Mejia was released. This is truly an injustice, and we must do everything we can to ensure that we get answers in this case and prevent a similar tragedy from being replicated elsewhere. While America has been and always will be a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. It is a privilege to live in this country, and anyone who comes here illegally and harms our citizens should without question constitute a priority for removal. For ICE to decide otherwise is baffling. In recognition of their clear mistake, they have since listed Mejia on their ``most wanted'' list and acknowledged they should have taken him into custody. The photograph of Sarah behind me was taken as she celebrated her graduation from Bellevue University with a 4.0 GPA and a bachelor's degree in criminal investigations and prepared to begin a bright future. The next day, she was killed. While nothing can bring Sarah back, her family and friends deserve clear answers as to why Mejia was allowed to flee. This tragedy further underscores the administration's failed immigration enforcement priorities and should serve to spur renewed discussion about their so- called priorities. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, there are a lot of people in this country who work very, very hard. We are known in this country as a people who work hard. Montanans are no exception. We have some of the hardest working folks I know who live in that great State. Whether it is a farmer preparing the spring crop or a fishing guide preparing for the upcoming tourist season, my constituents know what a long day's work looks like. In fact, many of my constituents work two jobs so they can put food on the table and a roof over their head and can save for their kid's college education. These folks don't wake up in the morning and say: Hey, I think I will take the year off and just sit it out. [[Page S2119]] That is why it is no surprise that when I went home for the March recess, Montanans were overwhelmingly disgusted with the majority's decision to refuse to do their job. Constituent after constituent asked me what the heck we were doing back here. Local editorial boards even chimed in. The Billings Gazette, my State's largest newspaper, tore the majority to shreds, saying that those who crow about making Washington work better are intentionally sabotaging the system, making it work worse. The Montana Standard, in ``Butte, America,'' accused Senators of ``shirking their constitutional responsibilities'' and denounced their tactics as ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.'' If that wasn't enough, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle described the crusade as ``nothing but an abdication of responsibility and another example of the kind of playground-level obstruction that has soured so many Americans on Congress and contributed to the divisive meltdown in the race to the GOP nomination for President.'' Now here we are. It has been 33 days since Judge Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court--33 days and counting. Yet there are no hearings in sight, no chance for the American people to have their voices heard through their elected representatives, no chance to ask tough questions of the nominee. This week we will hear the majority leader talk about regular order with respect to appropriations bills. But if regular order is good enough for appropriations bills, it is good enough for a Supreme Court nomination. The bottom line is this. The American people are as frustrated as I am. They are fed up with the obstructionism, and they want Congress to do its job. So let's have a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and then let's have a vote in the Senate. As the Montana Standard says, anything less than that is ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.'' I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in about 8 minutes we are going to start the vote on a motion for cloture, moving forward on the FAA bill. We have had a lot of debate about this. It passed with very little objection in the Commerce Committee. We have a package of 26 amendments, all of which have been cleared. We hope that can go as a separate amendment, almost like a managers' package. They are all noncontroversial. I am quite encouraged that we are making a number of reforms in the FAA that I have spoken about at length and that the chairman of the committee, Senator Thune, has spoken about at length. It is a good bill. Its previous adoption on a motion for cloture was something like 94 to 4. So you see where we are going. Then we will get into conference with the House, although it is my understanding they have not passed their bill. They passed it out of committee, but they have some controversial things. Hopefully, they will get it out, and we will be able to come to terms and get this reauthorization of the FAA, which we had to extend in a short-term reauthorization, because the clock is ticking. So I just wanted to share that with the Senate. Protecting the Manatee Now, Mr. President, since we have some time and no Senator is seeking recognition, I want to tell the Presiding Officer about a creature we have in Florida. We have lots of interesting creatures. There are things that come in that are like alien species, such as the Burmese python that they estimate--the Superintendent of Everglades National Park has estimated that there may be as many as 150,000. They got one 15-foot female, and she had 54 eggs in her. So you see how prolific they are. You cannot find them. The only way you can really find them is if there is a cold snap, because they will come out of the water, out of the river of grass where they are so exquisitely camouflaged. In a cold snap, they will come out of the water and up to the tree islands. Of course, you have seen some of those monsters--18 footers. Well, they had another critter that we have, because in Florida we do have alligators. Lo and behold, you may have seen this alligator. This alligator was 800 pounds and 15 feet long. He had been in a lake that was created in a cattle pasture, and he had been eating cows, so he had plenty of food. Well, this alligator, of course, is a critter that is native to Florida. It is the crocodile that is imported. You can tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile because the alligator has a rounded snout and the crocodile has a pointed one. All of this is to tell you we have another critter that is the most loveable critter, and we have had it on the endangered list. This is the animal called the manatee; some people call it a sea cow. These adorable creatures breathe air but live in the water. They have little flippers and a big body. Of course, they have these lovable faces. They have been endangered primarily because of boat propellers cutting them up. So we have had a serious effort at reducing the speeds of boats to a slow idle in manatee areas to protect them. They also get bothered by cold water. When there is a cold snap, they will migrate to warmer water. Pollution is another cause of the manatee being endangered. There has been a comeback. Around 20 years ago, there were only 1,200 of them in the world. That population has grown upward to 6,000. Here is the point: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to take them off the endangered list and put them into a lesser category. Those of us who want to protect these critters don't want them to come off the endangered list. If I had thought enough in advance, I would have brought a picture of a manatee. They are the most loveable critters. You can get in the water, you can swim with them, and you can feed them. When you feed them a pellet of food, they nibble like a horse nibbles sugar out of your hand--all of this under water. They are the most adorable critters. They love to be rubbed on their tummies. They love fresh water. In a brackish water system, where you can take a fresh water hose, they will come up and just drink the water, and then they will roll over so you can spray them underneath their flippers. Thank goodness they have rebounded, but there is a lot more to rebound. So, I wanted to share our crusade--our efforts to try to keep the manatee on the endangered list and to protect them. I yield the floor. Amendment No. 3680 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 3680 is agreed to. Amendment No. 3679, as Amended The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays are 5. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Hawaii. United States v. Texas Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Texas. This case is a challenge to President Obama's Executive actions to prioritize U.S. immigration enforcement. In 2012, the President used his legal authority to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA. DACA has given nearly 700,000 undocumented young people the opportunity to come out of the shadows to pursue their dreams through education and jobs. In 2014, again acting within existing legal authority, the President announced an expansion of the successful DACA Program. He also created a new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents Program, or DAPA. DAPA allows the undocumented parents of U.S.-born and legal permanent resident children, the majority of whom are U.S. citizens, to stay in this country with their families. Together, the expanded DACA and DAPA were expected to enable nearly 5 million people to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation. Unfortunately, Texas and 25 other States have challenged the President's authority to issue these Executive orders, resulting in the Supreme Court hearing today. Hundreds of DREAMers, Muslim students, and activists from California, New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere rallied on the Supreme Court steps this morning. I spoke with them and heard their stories and their hopes that the Supreme Court would make the right decision in support of the President and the millions of DACA and DAPA families. Many carried signs and stickers that read ``Keep families together.'' Keeping families together is at the crux of the President's Executive orders-- families like that of Gabriela Andrade, who, as a teenager, fled violence in Brazil and settled in Texas before coming to Hawaii. While Gabriela's sister and parents were granted visas through a lottery system, Gabriela fell through the cracks. Until President Obama announced the DACA Program, she lived in fear of being separated from her entire family. She said: DACA pulled me out of limbo and gave me a life again. It allowed me to go back to school to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science, to volunteer with several local organizations. Today, Gabriela is an advocate for DREAMers like herself. President Obama's DAPA and expanded DACA Programs would help thousands of families like Gabriela's who want to stay together and be contributing members of our communities without the daily fear of deportation. To tear undocumented parents away from their children and put these U.S.- born children in foster care is unconscionable. To deport people who were brought here when they were very young--to essentially tear them away from the United States, the only home and country they have known--is also unconscionable. These young people would be facing insurmountable odds, and I can certainly relate to some of the challenges they face. When I was almost 8 years old, my mother, brothers, and I legally immigrated to the United States. When we first arrived in Hawaii, we certainly struggled. I had to navigate the public school system without speaking a word of English. My mother worked low-paying jobs with no job security, and we struggled to make ends meet. But we took strength in being together as a family. However, in addition to facing the kind of challenges my whole family faced when we first arrived in this country, DACA and DAPA families live in constant fear that they will be ripped apart through deportation. These families and children have been living in limbo for over a year while the legal challenges work their way through the system, through the courts. In addition, United States v. Texas is also pushing DREAMers who are eligible for the original DACA Program, which is not being challenged, further into the shadows. Singai Masiya, who heads the Aloha DREAM Team in my home State and is a DREAMer himself, told my office that DACA-eligible people in Hawaii stopped applying for DACA. Why? They are afraid that if the Court rules against President Obama's Executive actions, their application information will be used to deport them. This is a real fear in our communities. United States v. Texas not only affects the lives of the more than 7,000 DACA- and DAPA-eligible Hawaii residents, it affects our economy. Over 10 years, DACA, DAPA, and expanded DACA are projected to provide a $276 million cumulative increase in Hawaii's State gross domestic product. The Center for American Progress also projects that, over 10 years, DACA, DAPA, and DACA expansion would provide a $136 million increase in the combined earnings of Hawaii's residents. However, in order to see these economic benefits, the Justices of the Supreme Court must rule on the side of DREAMers and the DAPA families. My hope is that the Supreme Court rules that the President is well within his legal authority in expanding DACA and DAPA and allows these Executive actions to be implemented. I note, however, that Executive actions, important as they are, are not enough. The President himself has called on Congress to fix our broken immigration system so that 11 million undocumented people in our country can come out of the shadows and live and work openly. It has been almost 3 years since the Senate passed bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform. I call upon Congress to do our jobs and enact fair, humane, and sensible immigration reform--recognizing that we are, indeed, a country of immigrants. That fact is at the very root of our strength as a nation. Mr. President, I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Order of Procedure Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, at 12 noon on Tuesday, April 19, the Senate vote on passage of H.R. 636, as amended; further, that following the disposition of H.R. 636, as amended, the Senate resume [[Page S2121]] consideration of S. 2012, the Energy Modernization Act, as under the previous order; that following disposition of S. 2012, as amended, if amended, but not prior to Wednesday, April 20, the cloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to H.R. 2028 be withdrawn and the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2028, the energy and water appropriations bill. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,83848,83848,83915,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2110-s2121] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] america's small business tax relief act of 2015 the acting president pro tempore. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of h.r. 636, which the clerk will report. the legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (h.r. 636) to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, and for other purposes. pending: mcconnell (for thune/nelson) amendment no. 3679, in the nature of a substitute. thune amendment no. 3680 (to amendment no. 3679), of a perfecting nature. the acting president pro tempore. the minority whip. immigration mr. durbin. mr. president, let me first thank the minority leader, senator reid, for his kind words about the dream act, which i introduced 15 years ago. [[page s2111]] this was a piece of legislation that came about because a mother called my office in chicago. here was her family story. she brought her two kids to america from brazil. they actually started off in korea, but they came through brazil and came to chicago--mother, father, and two kids. the father had the ambition of starting a church. there are a lot of korean churches around chicago and around the country, and his dream was to start a korean-american church. his dream never came true. he continued to pray and read the bible, but he didn't work much. it was up to mom to go to work. she went to work in a dry-cleaning establishment in chicago. if you have been around the great city i am honored to represent and go into a dry cleaners, most of the time korean families are running them. they are working around-the-clock, and are the hardest working people imaginable. mom went to work in the dry cleaners and the kids struggled because there wasn't much money coming in. one of their girls, tereza, heard about a program in chicago called the merit music program. it is a program that is available for low-income families of kids in public schools. the lady who left the money for it said to give them instruction in musical instruments and help them buy the instruments. tereza lee heard about this when she was a little girl and decided to sign up for it and to practice the piano. well, guess what. she turned out to be a prodigy. she was amazing. for her the merit music program was like an opening to another part of the world she had never seen. she participated in recitals. sometimes they told me they had to give her a key to the merit music offices because she wanted to stay and practice until late at night. it was tough for her getting through high school. she tells the story, when she was interviewed in the local press, that sometimes she didn't have a lunch to take to school or any money to buy food. she would wait until the other kids left, and she would go through the wastebasket and look for food they had left behind. that is how tough it was. but because of her skill at playing the piano, she was given an opportunity. she was accepted into the juilliard school for music in new york and at the manhattan school of music conservatory to pursue the piano. she was that good. when she and her mom started filling out the application, they reached that point where it said this: what is your nationality? what is your citizenship? her mom said: tereza, i don't know. we came here on a visitor's visa way back when you were 2 years old, but i never filed any papers for you. she said: mom, what are we going to do? her mom said: we are going to call durbin's office. so they called the senate office. we looked into it. the law in the united states was very clear for 17-year-old tereza lee. she had to leave the united states for 10 years and apply to come back in--leave for 10 years. she came here at the age of 2. she did not do anything wrong. she did everything right. she finished high school, against the odds. she developed a talent, against the odds. she was accepted at one of the best music schools in america, and our law very clearly said: leave; we don't want you. if you want to try to come back in 10 years, that is your business. i don't think that is right. that is why 15 years ago i introduced the dream act. it said: if you are one of those kids brought here under the age of 16, have finished high school, and have no serious criminal issues, we are going to give you a chance. go to college or join the military and we will give you a path to ultimately getting to the back of the line but becoming a citizen of the united states--the dream act. when i introduced this bill to solve tereza lee's problem, i used to give speeches about it all around chicago. a funny thing would happen. when i would finish the speech and go back to my car, sometimes at night, there would be somebody waiting by my car. as i got closer, it turned out to be a very young girl, usually, maybe with her friend. they would wait to make sure no one was around. the young girl would say to me: senator, i am one of those dreamers. i am undocumented. my mom and dad are scared to death that they are going to be deported, and then i will be deported. i hope you can pass this. well, time passed. we called the bill on the floor and called it in the house. we have never been able to make it the law of the land. sadly, the reality is that there are probably 2.5 million young people living in america who would qualify under the dream act to be given a chance to become legal--2.5 million. what happened to tereza lee? i have to finish that story. she ended up going to the manhattan school of music. two families stepped forward--families that had befriended the merit music program in chicago. i know one of them well. they said: this girl is too good. we can't waste her talent. we will pay for her education. they did so out of pocket. she did not qualify for any federal assistance because she is undocumented. so tereza finished school and played in carnegie hall. now she is about to complete her ph.d. in music. she is living in brooklyn, ny. she is a mom with a little girl. she married an american musician so she is legal--finally. that is her story. thank goodness this determined young girl stuck with it. we have to stick with it too. the people who want to turn away these 2.5 million dreamers ought to take a minute to meet them--just to meet them and to understand what it is to be a young person in america going through all the challenges of adolescence and all of the challenges that might be brought to you in your community or by our family and knowing in the back of your mind that at any moment, someone can knock on the door and tell you that you have to leave this country and that you are not here legally. they do it, and they fight every single day for a chance and a dream so that someday they will become part of the only country they have ever known. these are kids who, just like the senate a few minutes ago, got up every day in the classroom and pledged allegiance to that flag, the only flag they have ever known. they do not view themselves as mexican or korean. they view themselves as americans. the question is this: how do we view them? do we view them as an asset to america or do we view them as a problem--a problem that should be thrown away and deported? you are listening to the presidential campaign. we all are. i am not going to go into detail about some of the terrible things that have been said, but i just wish some of the haters, some of the people who want to turn on these young people, would meet them. come and meet them. hear their stories. i think even the hardest, coldest heart would be moved by them. across the street--you can see it through the window--is the supreme court building. it was about 12 years ago that we decided to do something in the senate that i thought was a great idea. every 2 years, when there is a new class of senators, we have a dinner with the justices of the supreme court. we do it at their place. it is right across the street. we line up in the entryway there--the beautiful marble entryway. there are tables set up, each of us sits at a table with one of the justices. i can remember one of the early times i went over there. i shared the table with another senator, robert c. byrd of west virginia, a legendary member of the senate and former president pro tempore of the senate. he served here for decades and carried the constitution around in his breast pocket. in his great days he could recite poetry nonstop. he was a real believer in the senate. he wrote the history of the senate, one that probably will never be matched. i shared a table with him in the supreme court for one of these dinners. i said: isn't this a beautiful building? he said: it sure is. i said: how often do you get over here, senator byrd? he said: this is my first time. i said: you have been in the senate for 40-plus years, and this is your first time? why? he said: well, it is a separate branch of government. we must respect them. they had never asked me to come over. well, i see it a little differently. i go across that street because, yes, it is a separate branch of government, but it [[page s2112]] is one that we should understand and respect, as i hope they understand and respect congress on this side of the street. so this morning i did. i went over for an argument before the supreme court. there was a huge mob out in front of the supreme court because the case that was being considered is one that affects millions of lives in america--texas v. united states. the question is this: what are we going to do with people like tereza lee, whom i just described earlier. you see, what happened 6 years ago is that i joined with republican senator richard lugar of indiana and wrote a letter to president obama saying: if the congress is not going to change the law to make it possible for these young people to stay in this country, would you issue an executive order that allows them, at least on a temporary basis, to stay in the united states? within a year or two, the president agreed to do it. he created what is known as the daca program. it basically says that young people like tereza lee, whom i described earlier, can step forward, identify themselves to our government, submit themselves for criminal investigation, and pay a filing fee of around $500, i believe it is. if they do, they will be given the right to stay in the united states on a temporary renewable basis for 2 years or 3 years. that is what daca is all about--so that young people can pursue their lives at least with the understanding that for a few years, they don't have to worry about that knock on the door. oh, if they get a job, they have to pay their taxes. if they go to college, they are not going to get a penny from this government. we don't help them pay for their college education. the president did it. i applauded him for doing it. so far, 700,000 young people just like tereza lee have signed up for protection under daca. we estimate that the total universe of young people eligible is about 2.5 million. so the president attempted to extend the daca program. he said: we need to address the problem with their parents. many of these parents have children who are u.s. citizens and legally in the united states, but they are undocumented and subject to deportation. so the president said, in what is known as dapa: the parents of these kids can come forward, submit themselves to a criminal background check with fingerprints and all, pay a filing fee of around $500, and then they will be allowed, on a temporary, renewable basis, if they keep their noses clean, to work in this country. if they are going to work in this country, they have to pay their taxes. well, that is what the president suggested. as soon as he made these two proposals to extend daca and to create this other program for the parents, a lawsuit was filed. it was led by the state of texas, and 25 other states, i believe, joined. that is the case before the supreme court today. before i get into the details of that case--and i want to say a word about it on the floor this afternoon--let me say one other thing. what senator byrd told me about not going across the street was not only respect for that institution of the supreme court, but as a senator he was basically saying that we need to respect their right to be above politics. we want to make certain that that branch of government is above politics, that they apply the law and interpret the constitution in a nonpolitical way. sometimes i read their decisions and think they have gone political on us. but the goal is to make sure they are preserved from becoming political. this morning, when i went before the supreme court, i did not face nine justices, only eight. antonin scalia, who passed away a few weeks ago, created a vacancy that has not been filled. why has the senate failed to fill this vacancy on the supreme court? because within hours of the untimely death of justice scalia, the republican leader, senator mcconnell, who was here a few moments ago, announced publicly: we will not fill this vacancy on the supreme court. that is important to remember. it is the first time in the history of the united states of america--the first time in the history of the senate--that the senate is refusing a hearing for a presidential nominee to fill a vacancy on the supreme court. it has never happened before--never. oh, the republicans argue: well, if the shoe were on the other foot, i am sure you democrats would do exactly the same thing. i call their attention to the year 1988. republican president ronald reagan, with a vacancy on the supreme court, submitted the name of anthony kennedy to the senate. a republican president was filling a vacancy on the supreme court, and he submitted the name of his nominee. the senate, then controlled by the democrats, gave anthony kennedy a hearing, a strong vote, and sent him over to the supreme court. so when the shoe was on the other foot, we did not play politics. but now we are. so i faced eight justices over there as that argument was made this morning. i thought to myself: if they end up in a 4-to-4 tie--and that can happen--it will be chaos and confusion across america, with different courts and different districts having different interpretations of the same law. how did we get into this mess? because the republican majority in the senate has decided: we are not going to appoint anyone to fill this vacancy. their argument is this: let the american people speak to filling this vacancy in the presidential election. let them decide whether it will be a democrat or a republican president filling this vacancy. there might be some value to that argument if president obama, in the last election, when he was running for reelection in 2012, had been running for a term of 3 years. you can argue then that this fourth year he was not entitled to be president. but you know what. it turns out that he was running for a 4-year term. it turns out he won by 5 million votes. it turns out that when it comes to being commander in chief and president of the united states, he has all the powers vested in him by the constitution, even in the fourth year. isn't that amazing--4 years as the president? that is what the american people decided, but only to be overruled by the republican majority in the senate. sorry, mr. president, they say, you only get 3 years. maybe we give you 3 years and 2 months, but you sure don't have the right to try and fill a vacancy on the supreme court, even though the constitution explicitly says in article ii, section 2: the president shall appoint a nominee to fill a vacancy on the supreme court. their argument is that you may think you are president when it comes to the supreme court, but the senate republican majority thinks otherwise. i sat down with merrick garland. he is the proposed nominee to fill this vacancy. he is chief judge of the d.c. circuit court, which is a high position in the judiciary. he was born in illinois, so i come to his nomination with some prejudice, but he is an extraordinary person. people have said: well, why didn't the president choose a woman? why didn't the president choose an african american? why didn't he choose a hispanic? why didn't he choose someone from india? why did he choose this man? i think he chose him for an obvious reason: he is clearly qualified. even republican senators have said nice things about him publicly. many of them have said they refuse to even meet with him, will not even sit in the same room with him. some have agreed to, but many have said no. senator mcconnell said: i won't meet with him because he is not going to get a hearing and he is not going to get a vote. it is time for us to fill that vacancy. it is time for us to accept our constitutional responsibility and show respect for the document we all swore to uphold and defend when we took the oath of office. it is time to fill that vacancy and put nine justices on the supreme court to avoid the uncertainty, confusion, and chaos which might otherwise emerge. i wish to say a word about the case before the court this morning. this was a case--united states v. texas--a legal challenge, as i mentioned earlier, to the president's immigration policy, filed by 26 republican governors. i believe this lawsuit has no legal merit. it is driven by political hostility toward president obama and his immigration policy. i was proud to join an amicus brief signed by 39 senators on our side of the aisle and 186 house democrats in support of the administration's decision [[page s2113]] on immigration. the president is on very solid ground in this case. i am hoping and confident that the supreme court will rule in his favor. as an initial matter before the case proceeds, the states that filed this lawsuit have to show they will be harmed by the president's immigration policy. otherwise, they really don't have any standing to sue. it turns out that exactly the opposite is true. the president's policy allowing people to work here on a temporary basis under his executive orders will create a huge benefit to the american economy. over the next 10 years, in the state of texas alone--and they brought the lawsuit; at least started it--the president's immigration action would increase that state's gross domestic product by more than $38 billion and increase the earnings of all texas residents by $17.5 billion. they argue that the president's immigration policy would cost the state of texas money. it turns out that exactly the opposite is true. even if the states have standing to sue, the supreme court repeatedly has held that the federal government has broad authority to decide questions of immigration. justice anthony kennedy, appointed earlier, wrote the opinion for the court striking down arizona's controversial immigration law. listen to what he said: a principal feature of the removal system-- removal of people who are not eligible to be in the united states-- is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials. . . . discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces immediate human concerns. unauthorized workers trying to support their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime. this administration's immigration policy is not just legal, it is smart and realistic. the president has said simply: we should prioritize. we have limited resources. we can't deport all those who are here undocumented. if we are only going to deport some, let's pick those who are a danger to the united states. the president has focused on those who have been convicted of serious crimes or pose a threat to our security. and shouldn't he? as commander in chief, shouldn't that be his highest priority, to make sure anyone who is a danger to the united states is gone? he knows he can't deport all even if he wished to, so he focuses on those who may be a danger to the united states--prosecutorial discretion. the department of homeland security only has enough funding to deport a small fraction of undocumented, so the president wants to focus the limited resources on those who could do us harm. that is just common sense. at the same time, the president said that we should not waste our resources on deporting young immigrant students who grow up in this country, such as tereza lee, whom i mentioned earlier, or tear apart families by deporting the parents of u.s. citizens. the president's policy is focused on deporting felons, not families--criminals, not children. in november of 2014, president obama established this program, dapa, deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents. under dapa, undocumented immigrants who have lived in the united states for more than 5 years and have american children would be required to come forward, register with the government, pay a fee, go through a criminal background check and a national security background check, and pay their taxes. if the government determines these parents have not committed any serious crimes and don't pose any threat, this executive order says: on a temporary, renewable basis, they will not be targeted for deportation. president obama also expanded the daca program for children, as i mentioned earlier, at the same time. why did he do that? because for years republicans in congress have refused to consider legislation to fix our broken immigration system. on the floor of the senate on june 27, 2013, i joined a group of seven other senators--four democrats and four republicans in total. we had worked for months to construct a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill. we had to give a lot. there were things in that bill which i didn't like at all and things which some of the republican senators didn't like, but it is the nature of legislation and compromise that that happens. we brought the bill to the floor for a vote after a lengthy markup in the senate judiciary committee, and dozens of amendments had been offered. the senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation on june 27, 2013, 68 to 32--more than 2 to 1. that bill would have strengthened border security, protected american workers, and established a tough but fair path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who were then currently living in our country. what happened to the bill after it passed the senate? i take you back to how laws are made and your civics course. it went across the rotunda to the house of representatives, which was under republican control. the majority in the house of representatives refused to call the bill, refused to even bring it to the floor for a debate, and refused to offer any substitute. they did nothing--nothing, despite our broken immigration system. in the face of this, the president was left with no choice. for the good of the american people, he used the authority given him as president to try to make some reforms to our immigration system. the center for american progress has studied what the president proposed, and they say that over the next 10 years, if these two programs--daca and dapa--were passed, the gross domestic product for my home state of illinois would increase by $15 billion and the earnings of illinois residents would increase by almost $8 billion. could your state use that--more economic activity, more people paying taxes to the federal government and to your state? virtually every state could use that. it is unfortunate that these bills have been blocked by the senate, and now they are trying to block them in the supreme court. i see senator cornyn is on the floor, and i will close by telling a story about another dreamer. i have done this quite a few times. my staff has done a lot of work on it. i thank them all for it. these stories really say a lot more than i ever could in a speech. they tell us what was at stake before the supreme court of the united states this morning. this attractive young woman is vasthy lamadrid. her family came to the united states from mexico. she was 5 years old. they came here with nothing. they moved into a home with four other families, so a lot of the kids slept in the same room. despite their poverty, vasthy felt safe and excelled in school. math was her best subject. she had nearly perfect scores on standardized tests. english was tough, but then she discovered a series of books called ``goosebumps.'' if you have kids or grandkids, i bet you have heard of that one. she became an avid reader and mastered the english language. by middle school, vasthy was placed in the gifted program. that is where she discovered her love of engineering. she was a student in the engineering pathway at bioscience high school, where she received the young entrepreneurs award, made the principal's list every semester, and played tennis. she was an active volunteer, working with such groups as girls for change, compugirls, e-tech, hospice of the valley, and st. joseph's hospital. vasthy also helped younger kids in her neighborhood by tutoring them in math and tennis. vasthy went on to attend arizona state university. because she is undocumented, she didn't qualify for a penny of government assistance, and she had to pay out-of-state tuition despite the fact that she had lived her entire life in the united states, in arizona. then something extraordinary happened. counting on the generosity of the american people, vasthy decided to crowdfund her college education. she shared her life story online and asked people to contribute to help her pay her tuition. well, it worked. she is currently in her second year of college. in the first semester, she made the dean's list with a 3.79 gpa in the ira fulton school of engineering. thanks to daca--the presidential executive order--she is able to support herself. she has also made time to continue to volunteer for a club called [[page s2114]] stem academy mentoring young children. she volunteers with the arizona immigration refugee service as an english teacher. as a result of her volunteer work, she has decided she wants to become a science teacher. can we use more science teachers in america? you bet. this is what she said in a letter she wrote: daca signifies to me a chance to show that i belong here-- that inside i am an american. it represents an opportunity to show that my parents' sacrifice was worth it. i love this country and want to one day become a citizen and continue to give back to the community. i don't need that journey to become a citizen to be easily given to me, but i'd hope that the journey is fair. vasthy and other dreamers have so much they can give to america. i don't understand the republican party when it comes to the issue of immigration. we are a nation of immigrants. my mother was an immigrant to this country. i am a first-generation american and proud of it. it is my honor to serve and represent a great state like illinois. i know what her journey was like. she was brought here at the age of 2 from lithuania. i know what her early life was like as she struggled to try to make sure there was food on the table, first for her mom, sister, and brother, and then ultimately for her own family. that is my family's story, but it is a story that is repeated over and over again. there is something in the dna of immigrants who are willing to risk everything in this world to go to a country where they don't even speak the language because they know they will have an opportunity here, and they bring something with them. that is why they light up the scoreboard in silicon valley with all of these new inventions and new corporations with thousands of employees that make us an economic success in many fields. that is why we should think twice about those who condemn immigrants in this nation of immigrants. i am confident the supreme court will uphold the president's immigration actions. then i hope, after they have done this, that the republicans in congress will finally decide to return to the table and work on a bipartisan basis for comprehensive immigration reform. i yield the floor. the acting president pro tempore. the majority whip is recognized. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i am always impressed with the distinguished democratic whip and his eloquence, but he is telling the american people that we have to choose between being a nation of immigrants or a nation of laws. the fact is, we don't have to make that choice; we can be both. but we can't do it when we have a president who simply believes he can do an end run around the u.s. constitution. in fact, according to pew, about 3.5 million people could claim the benefits of the president's unlawful executive action, receiving work permits, driver's licenses, and social security numbers. while we are a compassionate country, we are a nation of immigrants, that is not the kind of decision the constitution gives to a single political actor, even if he is the president of the united states. so there is a right way and a wrong way. and i realize the distinguished democratic whip believes that just because they can't get what they want when they want it, the president can then resort to this end run, but thankfully that is not the view of the courts. the u.s. federal district court in brownsville, tx, issued an injunction against the president's executive action. the fifth circuit court of appeals affirmed that injunction, and now the supreme court of the united states heard arguments in the case this afternoon. this is really more than just about immigration. this is whether, under the doctrine of separation of powers, the constitution we have lived under for lo these many years gives the president unilateral authority without the approval of congress, the elected representatives of the people, and in flagrant disregard for the laws that are already on the books. the heart of the case the court heard today is about stopping a president who said: i have a pen and i have a phone. and even though the american people have given republicans a majority in both houses and obviously forced the president to deal with a republican conference to come up with consensus legislation, the president said: forget that. i am not about trying to achieve bipartisan consensus on anything. if i don't get what i want, i am going to jam it through the system and hope the courts don't stop me. so it is not just about immigration, it is about the constitution itself. there are perhaps 22 different times, by my count, where the president of the united states acknowledged he didn't even have this authority. i remember in a speech he gave to la raza, an interview he gave on univision, the president denied he had the authority, which now, miraculously, our democratic friends think is clear-cut under the law. how can that be? it cannot be. i remember specifically being at a meeting where the president invited the leadership of both the house and the senate to the white house after the 2014 election. many may recall that leading up to that point, there had been a lot of rumors about the president issuing an executive action, but he had not done so. i remember specifically sitting there in the white house with some of my colleagues from the house and the senate, where then-speaker boehner said to the president: please, mr. president, don't do this. don't poison the well. don't make it impossible, by such a polarizing action, for us to build consensus on the building blocks of immigration reform where we could actually agree. i remember majority leader mccarthy making the same comment. i joined in and reiterated the same point. the president, defiant, told us he was going to go ahead and do it. there are a lot of conversations people are having today across the united states. i had some of those earlier today during some visits with people who were just wondering how to explain the political environment in america today. what i tell them is that this seems unprecedented in my experience. people are so angry. people are so scared. people are frightened and worried about the next generation. and for the first time in my memory, parents are doubting whether their children will enjoy the same sorts of freedom and prosperity that we enjoy today. that is a tragedy. my parents were part of the ``greatest generation.'' my dad was a b- 17 pilot in the army air corps, even before the air force came into being. on his 26th bombing mission over nazi germany, while he was flying in the 8th air force out of molesworth, england, he was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war for 4 months. fortunately, that was toward the tail end of the war. even though he was injured in his parachute jump--not seriously, as it turned out, although he had some disability associated with that later in life--he managed to survive that and even survived an appendectomy by a fellow prisoner of war when he had appendicitis in a pow camp. it is amazing. i always thought my dad had nine lives. even though he passed away at the very young age of 67, he survived countless occasions when surely he could have lost his life, including those occasions of jumping out of a burning b-17 plane over germany and an appendectomy in a pow camp at the hands of a fellow prisoner of war. the reason my parents and all of our parents sacrificed so much and risked so much and worked so hard is that they believed in the promise of america--the promise that exists only when the law is respected, when people in high office are bound by and obligated to and held accountable to the same laws that govern the most humble among us. that is what america is all about--a country where people, if they work hard and play by the rules, can achieve their dreams. i think that is the reason america seems so polarized today. people have sort of jumped outside the usual paradigm of political calculation where you are a liberal or you are a conservative or you are somewhere in the middle. people have sort of jumped that track, and we are seeing something entirely different on the left and on the right. i think the reason is, in part, because of a president who believes he is not bound by the constitution and laws of the united states. people are frightened because they have seen over the last 7 years-- even though the president was stopped legislatively after the affordable care act [[page s2115]] was passed and after dodd-frank was passed and then stopped by the electorate giving the republicans a majority in the house and in 2014 a majority in senate--that this president will not be stopped by the voters. that is the determination he made, and this executive order is exhibit 1 because he said: i don't care what the voters think. i don't care what the american people think. i don't care what the constitution says. i don't care that what congress says should be the law of the land. i am going to do it the way i want to do it. frankly, that is scary stuff when you are talking about the commander in chief, the leader of the free world, and the sort of power that goes along with that. rather than heed the warning--or i would really call it the plea of leaders in the house and the senate after the 2014 election--the president decided to go around congress and try to essentially change the law, giving work permits to people who were illegally present in the country, giving them driver's licenses, even giving social security numbers to an estimated 3.5 million people. how can the president do this when congress is deadlocked? well, he did it. and that is a question the supreme court is going to have to decide. at the time, the president called it a middle-ground approach. he is a master of rhetoric. the problem is the facts belie his words. the fact of the matter is this was a constitutional scorched-earth tactic. and more than anything else, it eroded public confidence in congress's ability, working with the white house, to get anything constructive done in the area of immigration. the acting president pro tempore is, of course, from the great state of oklahoma, and he went to school in texas. he understands what i understand: we have a large hispanic population in texas--about 38 percent. but we are a very diverse state. many people are surprised when i tell them the third most commonly spoken language in texas today is vietnamese--vietnamese. can you believe that? we also have a large indian american population. we are a very diverse state, and the main reason for that is we still represent that land of opportunity that america used to be, where people can come, work hard--those of modest means, with little on their backs and maybe nothing in their pockets--and achieve something and live the american dream. so i resent, i really do resent, the distinguished senator from illinois trying to tell us the president was only trying to do something that was good for texas. he doesn't have a clue. in fact, if we were to follow the policy choices of the leadership in texas, the country would be a heck of a lot better off when it comes to taking advantage of our energy resources, when it comes to taxes, reasonable regulation, and a willingness to try to accommodate those who invest capital and create jobs. to me, that is the single biggest difference between where i live in texas and what i see across our country and what is coming out of washington, dc. there seems to be an attitude here in washington of how many more obstacles, how many larger impediments can we place in the way of those who invest the capital and those who are creating the jobs and still expect the american dream to be alive. believe me, we have tested it. the obama administration has tested it, and what it has produced is disaster. it has produced a health care system that, rather than making health care more affordable, has made it more expensive, has caused people who liked their coverage to give up their coverage only to buy something that had a deductible that has, in essence, made them self-insured. it has created stagnant wages. it has created stagnant economic growth. there are not a lot of problems we have in this country that couldn't be mitigated, made better, if we just saw our economy growing again, instead of the sort of anemic and flatlined growth we have seen since 2008. my predecessor in the senate, mr. phil gramm, has a ph.d. in economics from texas a&m university. he has made the point that, historically, what you see after a recession like the one we saw following the fiscal crisis in 2008 is a v-shape recovery. in other words, you hit the bottom and you bounce up and you grow quickly because basically you have worked the problems out of the system. but what we have seen since 2008 is a u-shaped recovery, if you could even call it that. it is pretty close to flat, where the economy is growing at less than 2 percent, which is not fast enough to keep people fully employed. and we still have--although the unemployment rate has dropped down, we still have the smallest percentage of people participating in the workforce that we have had in the last 30 years. many people have simply given up, retired early, or made other arrangements. this is a serious matter. the supreme court heard arguments today. we know there are currently eight members of the supreme court. i heard the distinguished democratic whip complain about the fact that we have decided to allow the voters to choose in november the president who will make the choice to fill the scalia vacancy. well, the fact of the matter is, it is simply too important to allow president obama, given his penchant for lawlessness and usurpation of constitutional authority--to give him the chance to stack the supreme court in favor of a court that would likely rubberstamp his actions and those of future presidents for the next 25 years. the hypocrisy is rich, listening to our democratic colleagues. these are the folks who invented the judicial filibuster. they invented the judicial filibuster. they did that when president george w. bush was president. as controversial as the nomination of clarence thomas was, i believe he was confirmed with 52 votes--not 60 votes but 52 because nobody dreamed back then that senate rules would allow the minority party to insist on 60 votes to confirm a president's appointee. we know that after the election where the democratic majority lost that majority, in a lameduck session they jammed a number of appointees onto the d.c. circuit court of appeals in an effort to pack that court to match the ideological picture they wanted. again, this is the second most important court in the nation, which they believed would be more inclined to rubberstamp the overreaching by the obama administration. we are all familiar with the biden speech in 1992 when, as chairman of the senate judiciary committee, he suggested it would be perhaps inappropriate to confirm a presidential nominee in the waning days of that president's term. we saw the harry reid speech in 2005, where he said it is the president's prerogative to appoint, but the senate is not obligated to grant consent to that nomination. actually, i agree with senator reid back then, but not today, when he has taken the exact opposite approach. then there is senator schumer, the heir apparent to the democratic leadership in the senate, who said, in 2007, 18 months before george w. bush left office: i think there ought to be a presumption against confirmation. to listen to my democratic colleagues complain about the decision we have made to let the voters vote for the president who is going to fill that vacancy and to watch them--well, it looks like crocodile tears to me, and it smells like hypocrisy. as we have said, the supreme court of the united states heard arguments today in a case brought by the state of texas and other states that would otherwise be compelled to grant work permits, issue driver's licenses and social security numbers to people illegally present in the united states who did not comply with our laws. i am confident the court will find that the states have suffered real harm from the standpoint of the constitutional notion of standing; in other words, you have to have standing before you can sue. basically, it means you have to show real or potential harm if the court doesn't act. i am confident the court will find standing. but the court will do one of two things. either the court will affirm by being split 4 to 4 or all eight justices could write in favor of the fifth circuit decision to let the injunction stand or, if the court deems that this issue needs to be held over until the court has all nine members, after the first of the year, that is a decision the court can make. this is a very important issue, and i am glad the court is taking it up. we [[page s2116]] need to know--we need to know whether we remain a nation of laws as well as a nation of immigrants. the whole idea our democratic colleagues have foisted on us that somehow we have to choose between those two is a false choice. it is a false choice. we are both. we aren't one or the other. america has always been made better by people who have risked coming to the united states because they weren't satisfied with what they had or where they lived, but the day we begin rewarding people who do this in disregard of the laws is the day we begin to no longer be a nation of laws, and that is a legacy and a treasure we should not squander. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mrs. ernst). the senator from nebraska. tax reform mrs. fischer. madam president, i rise to discuss an issue of importance for nebraskans and americans all across this country; that is, the need for comprehensive tax reform. it is no secret the current tax code is overly complex and outdated. any american can tell you how frustrating it is to file a tax return. our tax code is riddled with deductions, exemptions, credits, exclusions, preferences, and loopholes that make it nearly impossible for anyone without a degree in tax law to understand. at the same time, we should recognize that some progress has been made. thanks to the work of chairman hatch and members of the senate finance committee, many important updates to the tax code were made permanent at the end of last year. in particular, increasing the deduction limit and making permanent section 179 of the tax code was an important step. this section allows small businesses to deduct from their taxes certain depreciable business assets. my constituents told me annual uncertainty about whether section 179 would be renewed made it very difficult for them to plan, to invest, and to grow their businesses. making this provision permanent reduced the ambiguity that had plagued nebraska's small business owners and operators. although we have made some progress in reforming the tax code, there is more work to do for the american people. i believe tax reform should focus on several principles, including competitiveness, simplicity, and economic growth. at nearly 40 percent, the united states has the highest combined corporate tax rate in the developed world. this is stifling job growth, hurting families, and compelling businesses to move overseas. any comprehensive plan should seek to lower this rate to a competitive level, one that will not only encourage current businesses to stay but also incentivize new businesses to set up shop. another goal of comprehensive tax reform should be to simplify the tax code. families and businesses spend billions of hours every year in completing their taxes. a disproportionate share of this burden is shouldered by many small businesses. many of these are family businesses, and they don't have the resources to easily comply. creating a tax system that is simple and efficient will reduce administrative and compliance costs. a simple tax system will also increase transparency, allowing americans to fill out their taxes accurately while preventing fraud and lost revenue. perhaps most importantly, any plan to reform the tax code--well, it must spur economic growth. inaction on reforming the tax code is delaying needed growth in gdp, jobs, and investment. when i was first elected to the senate, i thought my colleagues and i would immediately take up two issues to restart our economy, grow jobs, and help all american families: tax reform and reducing the overburden of government regulations. after all, it is pretty obvious these are two issues we can reform that would have a positive impact on our economy. we see regulations become ever more burdensome, and they continue to depress our economy, stifle innovation, and hurt our families. major tax reform has not happened. we continue to chip away, but i believe now is the time we step up and be bolder. we must make the necessary reforms to our tax system to give americans confidence in our future. we need to help put more money back in the pockets of hardworking americans and allow them to spend money on the goods and services they choose and that they need. it is my hope my colleagues will join me in continuing this discussion and that this dialogue then will eventually result in action, in comprehensive tax reform that truly benefits nebraskans and the american people. madam president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. wyden. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. china's aluminum industry mr. wyden. madam president, over the last few decades, china has used market-distorting subsidies and industrial policies to repeatedly prop up their own industries and rip off american jobs. steel, tires, solar panels--the story plays out again and again. too often china's economy is not run by the markets; it is run by government committee. so even though its own state council has called out the problem of severe excess capacities, china clings to the same old tired and destructive policies. today i want to address what is happening now with china's huge overcapacity of aluminum. the amount of aluminum chinese smelters are churning out has gone up by more than 1,200 percent in a decade and a half. in 2000, they produced 2.5 million metric tons. in 2015 china produced 32 million metric tons. when you create a glut of aluminum production the way china has, you send the markets into turmoil and you do enormous harm to american workers. i spoke last week at a public hearing held by the u.s. trade representative and the international trade commission about how the overproduction of steel in china is an urgent and immediate threat to steel jobs here in our country. while china's steel mills are churning out more steel than ever, american steel towns are suffering or worse. thousands of jobs nationwide have been lost just in the last year. even though one-third of all steel produced today has no buyer, china keeps adding and adding to the glut by producing more steel. the same story is played out in the case of primary aluminum. there is a huge overcapacity in china that, once again, is driven by market- distorting government policies. it has unleashed a chain of events that can end in economic devastation across this country. global aluminum prices have already plummeted, undercutting our american companies. between the start of 2011 and this upcoming june, the lights will have gone out at nearly two-thirds of the aluminum smelters in the united states. more than 6,500 jobs--good american jobs--will have been lost. you can bet that sooner or later the damage will ripple downstream through the entire aluminum industry, which employs three-quarters of a million americans either directly or indirectly. in my judgment, the united states is badly in need of a safeguard against this economic tidal wave. that is why i have chosen to stand with my friend leo gerard, president of the united steelworkers, and the steelworkers. they filed a petition for relief under section 201 of the trade act of 1974 today. without an immediate economic bulwark, the united states is in danger of losing thousands of good family-wage jobs across our country. it is my view that the administration should act in this case as soon as possible to defend our workers and our businesses from economic ruin. the united states and our trading partners must ramp up the pressure on china to stop overproduction, and our trade enforcers have to take on the trade cheats and use every single trade tool in the toolbox, including the enforce act, the leveling the playing field act, and the other measures my colleagues and i on the finance committee fought to get signed into law over the last year. i firmly believe workers in oregon and across this country can compete with anybody in the world, but the united states cannot afford to sit idly by and watch china's destructive policies cause our aluminum industry to be wiped out. as the steelworkers have pointed out repeatedly, enough is [[page s2117]] enough. leo gerard and those steelworkers are standing up and fighting back, and i am honored to stand with them. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. thune. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. thune. madam president, in a few moments, we will be voting on ending debate on h.r. 636, and that will allow us to proceed to a vote on the bipartisan federal aviation administration reauthorization act of 2016. i wish to urge my colleagues to support that motion to end debate. the legislation we are considering is not just any faa reauthorization. this bill is the most pro-passenger and pro-security faa reauthorization in recent history. travelers are frustrated, and this bill contains commonsense reforms to make travel safe and secure and more passenger-friendly. for over 2 weeks on the senate floor now and before that in the commerce committee, where i serve as chairman, we have been working hard to thoughtfully develop this bill and to allow for robust debate. for instance, there are drone safety provisions in the bill, including a pilot program to deploy technology to intercept drones near airports. these provisions are obviously intended to prevent accidents like the one that happened outside the heathrow airport this weekend, where a drone hit an approaching plane. we developed this provision and others in the bill through an open process that allowed every member of the committee to contribute and help write the bill. last year, we held six hearings on topics that helped inform our bill, and at the committee markup last month alone, we accepted 57 amendments, 34 of which were sponsored by democrats and 23 by republicans. on the senate floor, when it was reported out and taken up, we added 19 amendments, 10 from democrats and 9 from republican senators. the resulting bill is one we can be proud of, and both sides of the aisle have commended us for our inclusive process. when there have been differences, we have been able to find ways to address or set those aside for later so the progress on the legislation could move forward. even at this late hour, we have worked constructively to assemble a possible managers' package of more than two dozen additional amendments that we would like to adopt by voice vote prior to final passage. yet, even if that is not possible, i commit to those senators whose amendments we stand prepared to accept that i will work to address their concerns as we engage with our colleagues in the house of representatives. now it is time to conclude our work on the bipartisan faa bill that i introduced a long ways back, along with my friend and ranking member, senator bill nelson, and our aviation subcommittee leaders, senators kelly ayotte and maria cantwell. the bill includes reforms benefiting the traveling public, and we shouldn't let them down. let's vote yes on the motion to end debate and start moving these historic reforms forward. as i mentioned, i have a list of 26 amendments that we would like to clear--amendments offered by both sides. it is a package we could adopt. we have a couple of objections to doing that. if the members who have put forward those objections would be willing to release those objections, we would be able to get another 26 amendments adopted, many of which have been offered by colleagues, as i said, on both sides and many of which contain measures that i think will make the bill even stronger and make it a product we can all be proud of as it moves over to the house of representatives. there, i hope it will receive consideration and action and ultimately end up on the president's desk. the faa bill is legislation we have to do on a fairly routine basis around here. this authorization will stand for about 18 months. there are a number of important considerations that need to be addressed that this bill not only acknowledges but addresses. as i mentioned, those considerations have to do with drone safety, which is an increasingly important issue in our economy and one where we need to make sure we have the right rules of the air, if you will, in place so that we preserve and ensure that safety is the no. 1 factor as we continue to see the increased research, development, and deployment of drone technologies in ways that have tremendous commercial application. as i said, it also includes a lot of passenger protections which are very consumer-friendly in terms of passengers who travel on a regular basis with the airlines. so those are things as well that we need to address in this legislation. we enhanced the bill by amendment when it came to the floor with a couple of safety provisions that we think are critically important, particularly in light of what has happened of late with the attack in brussels and a number of other attacks we have seen, where we have had aviation insiders involved, if you will--particularly the metrojet airliner that crashed not that long ago and killed 224 people. there are a number of safety provisions that help address some of those concerns. as i said, we expand the tsa precheck program to limit the number of people who are in areas outside secure areas--outside the perimeter, so to speak--where they are more vulnerable to these types of attacks. these are all included in this legislation. so from an aviation security standpoint, this bill includes the most comprehensive security measures we will have adopted in nearly a decade. as i said before, from a passenger-friendly standpoint, according to a columnist at the washington post, this is one of the most passenger-friendly faa reauthorization bills we have seen literally in a generation. so these are reasons why this bill needs to move forward. i hope my colleagues here in the senate, when the vote comes here in a few minutes, will cast a vote in support of ending debate and allow us to move forward to a vote on final passage, which will enable this legislation to move forward to the house of representatives and i hope ultimately to the president so he can sign it into law and put many of these provisions in place that would be good for our country. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. grassley. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. immigration enforcement mr. grassley. madam president, today, i wish to pay tribute to sarah root, a young woman from iowa who just graduated from college with perfect grades. she was devoted to her family and friends and had a bright future, but she was taken from this earth too soon. i want to express my sympathies to sarah's parents and acknowledge michelle root, sarah's mother, who is watching today. she will be testifying tomorrow before the house committee on the judiciary at a hearing titled, ``the real victims of a reckless and lawless immigration policy: families and survivors speak out on the real cost of this administration's policies.'' the hearing will focus on how the obama administration's failed immigration policies allow thousands of criminal aliens to roam free. michelle root will share her personal story about the loss of her daughter and how someone in the country illegally was able to walk free and abscond from authorities after fatally hitting her daughter's vehicle on graduation night. sarah was 21 years old and had just graduated from bellevue university with an interest in pursuing a career in criminal justice. in the words of her family, ``she was full of life and ready to take on the world.'' according to a close friend of hers, sarah was smart, outgoing, and dedicated to her friends and family. she embodied the words: ``live, laugh, love.'' the day sarah graduated, she was struck by a drunk driver in the country illegally. the alleged drunk driver was edwin mejia, who had a blood alcohol [[page s2118]] content of more than three times the legal limit. the driver was charged with felony motor vehicle homicide and operating a vehicle while intoxicated on february 3. bail was set at $50,000, but he was only required to put up 10 percent. so, for a mere $5,000, the drunk driver walked out of jail and into the shadows. this case has shed light on the breakdown between the federal government and state and locals. it has also been a terrible example of why the president's policies don't work, and how they are having a dire effect on american families like the root family. under president obama's priority enforcement program, a person in the country illegally will only be detained or removed in a few limited circumstances. the administration hides behind these so-called ``priorities'' to ensure that a vast majority of people in the country are not removed. some say that nearly 90,000 illegal immigrant criminals were released in 2015 because of this policy. the administration's polices result in tragedies like sarah's. a smart young lady who had a bright future was struck by a drunk driver who entered the country illegally, and was turned over to a brother who was also in the country illegally, while awaiting his immigration court date. after the accident, local law enforcement apparently asked the federal government--specifically u.s. immigration and customs enforcement--to take custody of the driver, but the federal government declined. ice refused to place a detainer on him. an ice spokesman stated that the agency did not lodge a detainer on the man because his arrest for felony motor vehicle homicide ``did not meet ice's enforcement priorities.'' the driver made bond and absconded, never showing up for his hearings and required drug tests. it is difficult for the family to have closure since the man is nowhere to be found. it is unknown if he is still in the united states or if he has fled to his home country of honduras. sarah root is one of many victims who have been harmed or killed because of lax immigration enforcement and the notion that drunk driving isn't always a public safety threat. even though this tragic accident happened in the heartland of america, this is a border security problem. the driver of the vehicle that killed sarah entered the country illegally. every day, people are illegally entering the country, being removed, entering again, and committing more crimes. illegal re-entries are happening because there are no consequences. that is what happened in kate steinle's death. and, that is why we need to move on kate's law. that bill would deter people from illegally re-entering by enhancing penalties and establishing new mandatory minimum sentences for certain individuals with previous felony convictions. the obama administration cannot continue to turn a blind eye to drunk drivers, sanctuary communities, and people who ignore our laws, overstay their visas, or cross the border time and again. i am still waiting for answers from the obama administration on this case, and many more. there are many unanswered questions. how many more people have to die? how many more women and young people are going to be taken from their family and friends? things have got to change. the president must rethink his policies and must find a way to ensure that criminal immigrants are taken off the streets. the obama administration should try enforcing the law, instead of its priorities, for the sake of the american people. i want to wish michelle root the best of luck while she is in washington this week, and send my thoughts to her father who is trying to find justice back home. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. coats). the senator from ohio. mrs. ernst. mr. president, i rise today to echo the sentiments shared by our senior senator from iowa, chuck grassley. tomorrow morning, one of my constituents, michelle root, will be testifying before the house judiciary committee about the loss of her beautiful young daughter, sarah root. as a mother of three daughters myself, i cannot begin to fathom the pain and anguish mrs. root is experiencing. earlier this year, 21-year-old sarah root was killed by a drunk driver. that driver, edwin mejia, was allegedly drag racing with a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit when he crashed into the back of sarah's vehicle. edwin mejia is also an illegal immigrant. after causing the death of an american citizen and being charged with motor vehicle homicide, one would think he would clearly meet u.s. immigration and customs enforcement's so-called enforcement priorities. but no, citing the administration's november 2014 memo on immigration enforcement priorities, ice declined to lodge a detainer and take custody of mejia. during a recent homeland security and governmental affairs committee hearing, ice director sarah saldana actually suggested that ice neglected to issue a detainer because at the time they were contacted, sarah root was seriously injured, not dead. how twisted and convoluted has our immigration system become that an illegal immigrant who, while driving drunk and drag racing, hits and either seriously injures or kills an american citizen is not considered a priority for deportation? in fact, only after a floor speech, multiple letters, and hearing questions from senators from nebraska and iowa, as well as media attention and concerns raised by the root family, did ice finally acknowledge that they should have taken mejia into custody. it should not take all of those actions for ice to determine that an illegal immigrant who kills an american citizen should be removed from our country. tragically, after ice declined to file a detainer against mejia, he posted a $5,000 bond, was released, and has since disappeared. this is so despite the fact that he had a history of skipping court dates related to prior driving offenses. a few weeks ago, i spoke with sarah's dad, who told me that before they could even lay their daughter to rest, mejia was released. this is truly an injustice, and we must do everything we can to ensure that we get answers in this case and prevent a similar tragedy from being replicated elsewhere. while america has been and always will be a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. it is a privilege to live in this country, and anyone who comes here illegally and harms our citizens should without question constitute a priority for removal. for ice to decide otherwise is baffling. in recognition of their clear mistake, they have since listed mejia on their ``most wanted'' list and acknowledged they should have taken him into custody. the photograph of sarah behind me was taken as she celebrated her graduation from bellevue university with a 4.0 gpa and a bachelor's degree in criminal investigations and prepared to begin a bright future. the next day, she was killed. while nothing can bring sarah back, her family and friends deserve clear answers as to why mejia was allowed to flee. this tragedy further underscores the administration's failed immigration enforcement priorities and should serve to spur renewed discussion about their so- called priorities. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from montana. filling the supreme court vacancy mr. tester. mr. president, there are a lot of people in this country who work very, very hard. we are known in this country as a people who work hard. montanans are no exception. we have some of the hardest working folks i know who live in that great state. whether it is a farmer preparing the spring crop or a fishing guide preparing for the upcoming tourist season, my constituents know what a long day's work looks like. in fact, many of my constituents work two jobs so they can put food on the table and a roof over their head and can save for their kid's college education. these folks don't wake up in the morning and say: hey, i think i will take the year off and just sit it out. [[page s2119]] that is why it is no surprise that when i went home for the march recess, montanans were overwhelmingly disgusted with the majority's decision to refuse to do their job. constituent after constituent asked me what the heck we were doing back here. local editorial boards even chimed in. the billings gazette, my state's largest newspaper, tore the majority to shreds, saying that those who crow about making washington work better are intentionally sabotaging the system, making it work worse. the montana standard, in ``butte, america,'' accused senators of ``shirking their constitutional responsibilities'' and denounced their tactics as ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.'' if that wasn't enough, the bozeman daily chronicle described the crusade as ``nothing but an abdication of responsibility and another example of the kind of playground-level obstruction that has soured so many americans on congress and contributed to the divisive meltdown in the race to the gop nomination for president.'' now here we are. it has been 33 days since judge garland was nominated to the supreme court--33 days and counting. yet there are no hearings in sight, no chance for the american people to have their voices heard through their elected representatives, no chance to ask tough questions of the nominee. this week we will hear the majority leader talk about regular order with respect to appropriations bills. but if regular order is good enough for appropriations bills, it is good enough for a supreme court nomination. the bottom line is this. the american people are as frustrated as i am. they are fed up with the obstructionism, and they want congress to do its job. so let's have a hearing in the senate judiciary committee, and then let's have a vote in the senate. as the montana standard says, anything less than that is ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.'' i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. nelson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. nelson. mr. president, in about 8 minutes we are going to start the vote on a motion for cloture, moving forward on the faa bill. we have had a lot of debate about this. it passed with very little objection in the commerce committee. we have a package of 26 amendments, all of which have been cleared. we hope that can go as a separate amendment, almost like a managers' package. they are all noncontroversial. i am quite encouraged that we are making a number of reforms in the faa that i have spoken about at length and that the chairman of the committee, senator thune, has spoken about at length. it is a good bill. its previous adoption on a motion for cloture was something like 94 to 4. so you see where we are going. then we will get into conference with the house, although it is my understanding they have not passed their bill. they passed it out of committee, but they have some controversial things. hopefully, they will get it out, and we will be able to come to terms and get this reauthorization of the faa, which we had to extend in a short-term reauthorization, because the clock is ticking. so i just wanted to share that with the senate. protecting the manatee now, mr. president, since we have some time and no senator is seeking recognition, i want to tell the presiding officer about a creature we have in florida. we have lots of interesting creatures. there are things that come in that are like alien species, such as the burmese python that they estimate--the superintendent of everglades national park has estimated that there may be as many as 150,000. they got one 15-foot female, and she had 54 eggs in her. so you see how prolific they are. you cannot find them. the only way you can really find them is if there is a cold snap, because they will come out of the water, out of the river of grass where they are so exquisitely camouflaged. in a cold snap, they will come out of the water and up to the tree islands. of course, you have seen some of those monsters--18 footers. well, they had another critter that we have, because in florida we do have alligators. lo and behold, you may have seen this alligator. this alligator was 800 pounds and 15 feet long. he had been in a lake that was created in a cattle pasture, and he had been eating cows, so he had plenty of food. well, this alligator, of course, is a critter that is native to florida. it is the crocodile that is imported. you can tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile because the alligator has a rounded snout and the crocodile has a pointed one. all of this is to tell you we have another critter that is the most loveable critter, and we have had it on the endangered list. this is the animal called the manatee; some people call it a sea cow. these adorable creatures breathe air but live in the water. they have little flippers and a big body. of course, they have these lovable faces. they have been endangered primarily because of boat propellers cutting them up. so we have had a serious effort at reducing the speeds of boats to a slow idle in manatee areas to protect them. they also get bothered by cold water. when there is a cold snap, they will migrate to warmer water. pollution is another cause of the manatee being endangered. there has been a comeback. around 20 years ago, there were only 1,200 of them in the world. that population has grown upward to 6,000. here is the point: the u.s. fish and wildlife service wants to take them off the endangered list and put them into a lesser category. those of us who want to protect these critters don't want them to come off the endangered list. if i had thought enough in advance, i would have brought a picture of a manatee. they are the most loveable critters. you can get in the water, you can swim with them, and you can feed them. when you feed them a pellet of food, they nibble like a horse nibbles sugar out of your hand--all of this under water. they are the most adorable critters. they love to be rubbed on their tummies. they love fresh water. in a brackish water system, where you can take a fresh water hose, they will come up and just drink the water, and then they will roll over so you can spray them underneath their flippers. thank goodness they have rebounded, but there is a lot more to rebound. so, i wanted to share our crusade--our efforts to try to keep the manatee on the endangered list and to protect them. i yield the floor. amendment no. 3680 the presiding officer. under the previous order, amendment no. 3680 is

states v. texas. this case is a challenge to president obama's executive actions to prioritize u.s. immigration enforcement. in 2012, the president used his legal authority to establish the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, or daca. daca has given nearly 700,000 undocumented young people the opportunity to come out of the shadows to pursue their dreams through education and jobs. in 2014, again acting within existing legal authority, the president announced an expansion of the successful daca program. he also created a new deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents program, or dapa. dapa allows the undocumented parents of u.s.-born and legal permanent resident children, the majority of whom are u.s. citizens, to stay in this country with their families. together, the expanded daca and dapa were expected to enable nearly 5 million people to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation. unfortunately, texas and 25 other states have challenged the president's authority to issue these executive orders, resulting in the supreme court hearing today. hundreds of dreamers, muslim students, and activists from california, new york, new jersey, and elsewhere rallied on the supreme court steps this morning. i spoke with them and heard their stories and their hopes that the supreme court would make the right decision in support of the president and the millions of daca and dapa families. many carried signs and stickers that read ``keep families together.'' keeping families together is at the crux of the president's executive orders-- families like that of gabriela andrade, who, as a teenager, fled violence in brazil and settled in texas before coming to hawaii. while gabriela's sister and parents were granted visas through a lottery system, gabriela fell through the cracks. until president obama announced the daca program, she lived in fear of being separated from her entire family. she said: daca pulled me out of limbo and gave me a life again. it allowed me to go back to school to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science, to volunteer with several local organizations. today, gabriela is an advocate for dreamers like herself. president obama's dapa and expanded daca programs would help thousands of families like gabriela's who want to stay together and be contributing members of our communities without the daily fear of deportation. to tear undocumented parents away from their children and put these u.s.- born children in foster care is unconscionable. to deport people who were brought here when they were very young--to essentially tear them away from the united states, the only home and country they have known--is also unconscionable. these young people would be facing insurmountable odds, and i can certainly relate to some of the challenges they face. when i was almost 8 years old, my mother, brothers, and i legally immigrated to the united states. when we first arrived in hawaii, we certainly struggled. i had to navigate the public school system without speaking a word of english. my mother worked low-paying jobs with no job security, and we struggled to make ends meet. but we took strength in being together as a family. however, in addition to facing the kind of challenges my whole family faced when we first arrived in this country, daca and dapa families live in constant fear that they will be ripped apart through deportation. these families and children have been living in limbo for over a year while the legal challenges work their way through the system, through the courts. in addition, united states v. texas is also pushing dreamers who are eligible for the original daca program, which is not being challenged, further into the shadows. singai masiya, who heads the aloha dream team in my home state and is a dreamer himself, told my office that daca-eligible people in hawaii stopped applying for daca. why? they are afraid that if the court rules against president obama's executive actions, their application information will be used to deport them. this is a real fear in our communities. united states v. texas not only affects the lives of the more than 7,000 daca- and dapa-eligible hawaii residents, it affects our economy. over 10 years, daca, dapa, and expanded daca are projected to provide a $276 million cumulative increase in hawaii's state gross domestic product. the center for american progress also projects that, over 10 years, daca, dapa, and daca expansion would provide a $136 million increase in the combined earnings of hawaii's residents. however, in order to see these economic benefits, the justices of the supreme court must rule on the side of dreamers and the dapa families. my hope is that the supreme court rules that the president is well within his legal authority in expanding daca and dapa and allows these executive actions to be implemented. i note, however, that executive actions, important as they are, are not enough. the president himself has called on congress to fix our broken immigration system so that 11 million undocumented people in our country can come out of the shadows and live and work openly. it has been almost 3 years since the senate passed bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform. i call upon congress to do our jobs and enact fair, humane, and sensible immigration reform--recognizing that we are, indeed, a country of immigrants. that fact is at the very root of our strength as a nation. mr. president, i yield back. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the acting president pro tempore. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the acting president pro tempore. without objection, it is so ordered. order of procedure mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule xxii, at 12 noon on tuesday, april 19, the senate vote on passage of h.r. 636, as amended; further, that following the disposition of h.r. 636, as amended, the senate resume [[page s2121]]

Mr. President, today I wish to bring renewed attention to the continued violence perpetrated by Boko Haram against women and children. It has now been 2 years since the horrific kidnapping of 279 school girls in Nigeria. In the aftermath of this brazen attack, Senator Mikulski and I, joined by the other women in the Senate, strongly advocated for the imposition of sanctions on Boko Haram, and the international community responded by doing just that. We were grateful for Secretary Kerry's swift action to get this done at the United Nations, and Boko Haram is now subject to a complete asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo. In addition, the Senate unanimously passed legislation that I authored to require a comprehensive, 5-year strategy to combat Boko Haram at the end of last year. Next week, I am sending a letter signed by many of the cosponsors of this legislation to our colleagues in the House of Representatives, urging them to take up this important measure. Nevertheless, Boko Haram has continued to wage its relentless war on innocent civilians in Nigeria and throughout the Lake Chad Basin since it declared its allegiance to ISIS last year. More women and more girls have been kidnapped. Although some of the [[Page S2122]] captives have escaped, most are still lost, likely subjected to forced marriages, religious conversions, sexual trafficking, slavery, and possibly forced to carry out suicide bombings on behalf of Boko Haram. According to UNICEF, 39 out of 89 Boko Haram suicide bombings in 2015 were carried out by women, and the number of children involved in suicide bombings increased tenfold in just one year. The fact that children are being used as weapons in Boko Haram's terror campaign speaks to the inhumanity and total disregard for life that is at the core of this terrorist group's perverse ideology. As Boko Haram increasingly relies upon women and children to carry out its attacks, survivors who have lived through such unimaginable ordeals are often met with suspicion when they return to their communities. Such marginalization extends their suffering. In a letter to Nigeria's bishops, Pope Francis wrote: ``Do not grow tired of doing what is right.'' He urged: ``Go forward on the way of peace. Accompany the victims! Come to the aid of the poor! Teach the youth!'' I could not agree more. We must keep fighting to ensure that all Nigerians can live in peace and that young girls everywhere can pursue an education without fear of violence or intimidation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2121-S2122] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALLING FOR RENEWED ATTENTION TO BOKO HARAM Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Public Law 114-74, included an instruction to the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to file allocations, aggregates, and budgetary levels in the Senate after April 15, 2016.

Mr. President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Public Law 114-74, included an instruction to the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to file allocations, aggregates, and budgetary levels in the Senate after April 15, 2016. Today, I wish to submit the required filing found in that act. Specifically, section 102 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 requires the chairman to file: No. 1, an allocation for fiscal year 2017 for the Committee on Appropriations; No. 2, an allocation for fiscal years 2017, 2017 through 2021, and 2017 through 2026 for committees other than the Committee on Appropriations; No. 3, aggregate spending levels for fiscal year 2017; No. 4, aggregate revenue levels for fiscal years 2017, 2017 through 2021, and 2017 through 2026; and No. 5, aggregate levels of outlays and revenue for fiscal years 2017, 2017 through 2021, and 2017 through 2026 for Social Security. The figures included in this filing are consistent with the discretionary spending limits set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and the most recent baseline from the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. CBO's last baseline was released on March 24, 2016. In addition to the update for enforceable limits above, section 102(c) of the act allows for the matter contained in subtitles A and B of title IV of S. Con. Res. 11, the fiscal year 2016 congressional budget resolution, to be updated by 1 fiscal year. Pursuant to this authority, all reserve funds available to the Senate in title IV of last year's budget resolution are updated and available for use. For purposes of enforcing the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule, which is found in section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 congressional budget resolution, I am resetting the Senate's scorecard to zero for all fiscal years. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables detailing enforcement in the Senate be printed in the Record.

CREC-2016-04-18-pt1-PgS2122,CREC-2016-04-18,114,NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DECISIONS DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2122] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DECISIONS DAY Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize that Saturday, April 16, 2016, was National Healthcare Decisions Day. National Healthcare Decisions Day exists to inspire, educate, and empower the public and providers about the importance of advance care planning. Started by a Richmond attorney as a local grassroots initiative in Virginia, NHDD became an annual event in 2008, and today it is recognized across all 50 States. Faith-based groups, doctors and nurses, hospitals, patients, and caregivers alike are engaged in these efforts. NHDD is an opportunity for all Americans to discuss their preferences and goals with family and friends--and this starts with filling out an advance directive. In the last year, we have made real progress in giving Americans access to the clear, consistent, and concise information they need to make critical health care decisions, and there is a growing awareness of the need to transform advanced care, both among providers and families. In my own State of Virginia, the general assembly recently designated April as Advance Care Planning Month. Around the Commonwealth, Virginians are innovating and creating new models of care to provide patients with the tools and support to make their own advanced care decisions. For example, the Richmond Academy of Medicine's Honoring Choices Initiative is a partnership with three major health care systems working to adopt nationally recognized best practices and adapting them to the needs of patients, families, doctors, and hospitals in central Virginia. On the ground, Virginians are holding dozens of events this month to encourage individuals to fill out an advance directive. This year has been a significant one at the national level as well. For the first time, Medicare providers are being compensated for spending time with their patients to discuss their health care decisions. And I am pleased that the bipartisan Care Planning Act, which I introduced again this last year with Senator Isakson, has gained more support than ever, including from nearly 90 health and senior advocacy groups. The purpose of the Care Planning Act is to align the care people want with the level of care they get. It doesn't limit choices; it works to make sure people are made fully aware of the broad range of choices they have. The growing support for this legislation demonstrates just how far the conversation around advance care planning has come. While physician reimbursement is an important first step, the Care Planning Act provides a strong, bipartisan foundation for Congress as we consider how to further empower patients to make informed choices about their own care. I am working to advance this conversation wherever I can. For example, Senator Isakson and I are cochairs of the Finance Committee's bipartisan chronic care working group, and we are looking at a broad range of policies so that chronically ill patients receive the highest quality care at all stages of illness, especially towards the end of life. We are not going to pass the Care Planning Act in full as a part of that process, but I see this process as a real way to move the ball forward. While this process remains a work in progress, I am hopeful that we will be able to get some of these bipartisan provisions done. I know how important this is not just from my time serving as a Governor and as a Senator but through the eyes of a loved one who struggled with these issues. My own mother suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years, and for 9 of those years, she couldn't speak. My father, sister, and I found grappling with the challenges of caring for her difficult.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize that Saturday, April 16, 2016, was National Healthcare Decisions Day. National Healthcare Decisions Day exists to inspire, educate, and empower the public and providers about the importance of advance care planning. Started by a Richmond attorney as a local grassroots initiative in Virginia, NHDD became an annual event in 2008, and today it is recognized across all 50 States. Faith-based groups, doctors and nurses, hospitals, patients, and caregivers alike are engaged in these efforts. NHDD is an opportunity for all Americans to discuss their preferences and goals with family and friends--and this starts with filling out an advance directive. In the last year, we have made real progress in giving Americans access to the clear, consistent, and concise information they need to make critical health care decisions, and there is a growing awareness of the need to transform advanced care, both among providers and families. In my own State of Virginia, the general assembly recently designated April as Advance Care Planning Month. Around the Commonwealth, Virginians are innovating and creating new models of care to provide patients with the tools and support to make their own advanced care decisions. For example, the Richmond Academy of Medicine's Honoring Choices Initiative is a partnership with three major health care systems working to adopt nationally recognized best practices and adapting them to the needs of patients, families, doctors, and hospitals in central Virginia. On the ground, Virginians are holding dozens of events this month to encourage individuals to fill out an advance directive. This year has been a significant one at the national level as well. For the first time, Medicare providers are being compensated for spending time with their patients to discuss their health care decisions. And I am pleased that the bipartisan Care Planning Act, which I introduced again this last year with Senator Isakson, has gained more support than ever, including from nearly 90 health and senior advocacy groups. The purpose of the Care Planning Act is to align the care people want with the level of care they get. It doesn't limit choices; it works to make sure people are made fully aware of the broad range of choices they have. The growing support for this legislation demonstrates just how far the conversation around advance care planning has come. While physician reimbursement is an important first step, the Care Planning Act provides a strong, bipartisan foundation for Congress as we consider how to further empower patients to make informed choices about their own care. I am working to advance this conversation wherever I can. For example, Senator Isakson and I are cochairs of the Finance Committee's bipartisan chronic care working group, and we are looking at a broad range of policies so that chronically ill patients receive the highest quality care at all stages of illness, especially towards the end of life. We are not going to pass the Care Planning Act in full as a part of that process, but I see this process as a real way to move the ball forward. While this process remains a work in progress, I am hopeful that we will be able to get some of these bipartisan provisions done. I know how important this is not just from my time serving as a Governor and as a Senator but through the eyes of a loved one who struggled with these issues. My own mother suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years, and for 9 of those years, she couldn't speak. My father, sister, and I found grappling with the challenges of caring for her difficult. The difficulty was greater because, when she was first diagnosed, my family didn't take the opportunity to talk in an honest and fully informed way with her and her health care providers about the full array of health care options available or about what her priorities would be during the final years of her life.

I feel I would be remiss if I did not mark some of his achievements at Emory here in the Record, as the success of Emory University and its students has made a difference to our Nation. Emory University's reputation as a private research university that has led in academic, research, and health care eminence extends far beyond its beautiful campus, which is headquartered in the beautiful Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta, GA. President Wagner has enhanced the school's reputation, recruiting a world-class and diverse community of scholars and researchers who have secured an increased number of appointments to national academies and an increased amount of external research funding that added up to more than $570 million in 2015. President Wagner guided the Emory community in developing the university's first vision statement, which established the foundation for a 10-year strategic plan focused on strengthening faculty distinction, ensuring the highest student quality, enhancing the student experience, and exploring new frontiers in science and technology. President Wagner also led a fundraising campaign that resulted in the investment of $1.7 billion in support of the university's initiatives in teaching, research, scholarship, patient care, and social action. In short, President Wagner has advanced all aspects of the university's mission through the innovative design and construction of a number of new facilities to support health sciences research, science education, residential life, library resources, and patient care. I hope that President Wagner and I will remain in touch wherever his next step takes him, and I wish him and his wife, Debbie, the very best. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Page S2122] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO JAMES WAGNER Mr. ISAKSON.

A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas urging the federal government to require the use of sound science in evaluating crop protection chemistries and nutrients; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. House Resolution No. 6045 Whereas, Agriculture is crucial to the continued production of food, feed, fiber and energy to meet both domestic and global demand; and Whereas, In the United States, the agriculture and value- added industries and businesses utilize precision farming equipment, crop protection chemistries, genetic engineering or enhancement, agricultural nutrients and other modern technologies. Such advanced practices protect the safety of the public and reduce environmental and natural resource impacts, while increasing yields, improving profitability and ensuring an abundant, affordable and wholesome food supply; and Whereas, Agricultural production systems and crop protection are among the most studied and highly regulated of all industries, at both the state and federal levels. The use of sound science should be the bedrock of our nation's regulatory scheme for the agriculture and food production industries, as these industries are critical to the economic vitality of Kansas and the United States: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas: That we support the use of sound science to study and regulate modern agricultural technologies such as crop protection chemistries and genetically engineered or enhanced traits and nutrients; and be it further Resolved, That we oppose legislative or regulatory action at any level that may result in unnecessary restrictions on the use of modern agricultural technologies. ____ POM-148. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas urging the President of the United States to obey the United States Constitution and declare that the detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay will remain; to the Committee on Armed Services. House Concurrent Resolution No. 5024 Whereas, The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has threatened to move the terrorist detainees currently held at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to Fort Leavenworth without regard to the wishes or the safety of the people of Kansas; and Whereas, The President has threatened to close the detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay; and Whereas, The threat of the transfer has been underscored by visits to Fort Leavenworth by officials of his Administration, preparing for the threatened transfer; and Whereas, Many detainees that have been released have continued to fight against this country and its allies; and Whereas, This President and others have insisted that the mere existence of the detention facility at Guantanamo has inflamed terrorists around the world and aided in their recruitments; and Whereas, Transferring the detainees to Fort Leavenworth will only transfer the ire of terrorists worldwide from Guantanamo to Fort Leavenworth; and Whereas, This President has a demonstrated willingness to violate American law; and Whereas, This President has said that he will go around the Congress to accomplish his agenda; and Whereas, Closing the Naval Station at Guantanamo has been high on this President's agenda since before he was first elected; and Whereas, The President has continually sought to weaken our standing in the world; and Whereas, The terrorists have demonstrated an ability and willingness to conduct attacks in America, in furtherance of their savage war against America; and Whereas, Detonating large bombs in civilian communities in the vicinity of Fort Leavenworth would be exactly the sort of demonstration that the terrorists would try; and Whereas, Fort Leavenworth does not have the necessary facilities to hold and care for the detainees and would, for example, be forced to transport them through the city of Leavenworth to access medical care, thereby presenting additional soft, tempting targets for attacks; and Whereas, The surrounding community does not have the law enforcement, emergency response resources or the physical capability to harden potential civilian targets in the surrounding area. Transferring detainees to Fort Leavenworth represents a predictable, direct and unnecessarily high risk to American citizens in the vicinity of Fort Leavenworth; and Whereas, The Naval Station at Guantanamo is a high security facility designed to both house high risk detainees and be secure from attack by external forces. This facility has not been the object of an external terrorist attack and, if it had been attacked, it would not have represented a threat to American civilians or communities; and Whereas, The intentional placement of detainees on American soil, physically within an American community, would unnecessarily and intentionally put American citizens at much greater risk. It follows that any move by the President or other members of the Federal, State or local government to move the detainees to Fort Leavenworth would mean intentionally and knowingly placing American citizens at greater risk, in violation of the government's sworn oath to support and defend them against enemies, foreign or domestic; and Whereas, Officers from over one hundred countries attend classes at Fort Leavenworth; and Whereas, Many of these officers would not bring their families nor be permitted by their countries to attend, if the detainees were transferred to Fort Leavenworth, thereby hurting the local economy; and Whereas, These officers and their families represent an important bond and link among our nations. Their loss will not just affect the local economy, but would potentially have grave impacts on our future ability to effectively and successfully find peaceful solutions to international problems: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Legislature of the State of Kansas urges the President of the United States to obey the Constitution of the United States and the laws of this country, the people of which have placed him in a position of great trust and responsibility and depend upon him to ensure that the laws be upheld and that their security be maintained; and be it further Resolved, That the President must declare that the detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay will remain, and that the detainees will continue to be held there, until said detainees are given proper, lawful disposition, in accordance with the Laws of War and the best interests of the safety of the people of the United States and their allies. ____ POM-149. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urging the United States Congress to modernize the federal cap on the locally set Passenger Facility Charges user fee by setting it at $8.50 and adjusting it periodically to offset the impacts of inflation; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Senate Resolution No. 261 Whereas, In 2010, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's public use airports supported approximately 304,000 jobs, generated $9.2 billion in annual payroll and produced $23.6 billion in annual economic activities; and Whereas, In 1990, the Congress of the United States authorized Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs), local user fees collected for every boarded passenger, to help airports of all sizes meet their capital needs to finance Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved projects such as terminals, parking and multimodal projects that enhance safety, security, capacity, noise reduction or increase air carrier competition; and Whereas, PFCs are locally determined fees collected at the point of sale, which do not affect Federal expenditures; and Whereas, The PFC cap was last raised in 2000 when Congress set it at $4.50; and Whereas, Inflation has eroded the buying power of PFCs by approximately one-half since then due to rising construction costs; and Whereas, There is a growing recognition of the need for infrastructure finance and funding to keep pace with inflation and action for doing so such as the act of November 25, 2014 (P.L. 974, No. 89) in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and Whereas, Modernizing the PFC cap to $8.50 now and indexing it for inflation would restore its original purchasing power and provide local communities with the ability to set their individual PFC user fees based on locally determined needs for ensuring the safety and security of their airports; and Whereas, Over the next five years, airports will require more than $75 billion to improve infrastructure to prevent passenger delays and congestion; and Whereas, Direct Federal funding through the FAA Airport Improvement Program has declined 10% over the past six years and covers only a fraction of the total infrastructure projects required to upgrade and maintain the world-class aviation system: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United States to modernize the Federal cap on the locally set PFC user fee by setting it at $8.50 and adjusting it periodically to offset the impacts of inflation; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution to be sent to the President of the United States, the presiding officers of each house of [[Page S2126]] Congress and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania. ____ POM-150. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to ensure the continued appropriation of watercraft inspection station funding in the fiscal year 2017 budget to significantly enhance aquatic invasive species prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Joint Memorial No. 104 Whereas, maintaining a healthy suite of economic, environmental and social ecosystem services in aquatic systems is integral to the quality of life in the State of Idaho; and Whereas, healthy aquatic habitats provide clean drinking water, flood control, transportation, recreation, purification of human and industrial wastes, power generation, habitat for native plants and animals, production of fish and other foods, marketable goods and cultural benefits; and Whereas, Dreissenid mussels, specifically quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), are aquatic invasive species that cause irreparable ecological damage to many waters in the United States; and Whereas, Dreissenids have not yet been detected in the Pacific Northwest. The estimated annual cost to address established populations of Dreissenids in the Pacific Northwest Economic Region is almost $0.5 billion annually; and Whereas, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act was signed in June 2014. Section 1039 of the act authorizes $20 million for Columbia River Basin watercraft inspection stations to prevent introduction of Dreissenid mussels and other aquatic invasive species through the Secretary of the Army; and Whereas, the fiscal year 2016 budget for the United States Army Corps of Engineers includes $4 million in funding for watercraft inspection stations as authorized by the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, and the State of Idaho and Pacific Northwest Economic Region are grateful for the Corps' recognition of the severity of the threat of aquatic invasive species to the region and dedication to assist the region in enhancing prevention efforts: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the members of the Second Regular Session of the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that we respectfully request that Congress ensure the continued appropriation of these funds in the fiscal year 2017 budget to significantly enhance aquatic invasive species prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States. ____ POM-151. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Ohio encouraging the President of the United States, the United States Congress, and the United States Office of Management and Budget to support plans to upgrade the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and encourage the United States Army Corps of Engineers to take expeditious action in preparing an Economic Reevaluation Report; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. House Resolution Number 263 Whereas, The Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, are of the utmost importance to Ohio and play a critical role in the nation's economy and security. Each year, approximately 10,000 Great Lakes vessels, carrying 80 million tons of iron ore, coal, grain, and other cargo, safely and efficiently traverse the locks; and Whereas, Nearly 80% of all domestic iron ore, the primary material used to manufacture steel, travels from mines in Minnesota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula through the Soo Locks to steel producers in Ohio; and Whereas, Only one of the four Soo Locks, the Poe Lock, is large enough to accommodate the modem vessels that commonly traverse the Great Lakes. 70% of cargo is carried on these large ships that can only pass through the Poe Lock, and the remaining cargo must pass through the smaller MacArthur Lock. The 100-year-old Davis and Sabin Locks are rarely used as they are the smallest locks and cannot accommodate large modem vessels; and Whereas, The continued reliance on only the Poe Lock poses a serious risk to national security and the economies of not only the State of Ohio, but also the entire country. A long- term outage of the Poe Lock due to lock failure or a terrorist attack could cripple the economy and disrupt steel production in the United States. It is estimated that a 30- day outage of the Poe Lock would result in economic losses of $160 million; and Whereas, Upgrades to the Soo Locks are needed to ensure national security and unfettered commerce through the Great Lakes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers acknowledges that the Soo Locks are a single point of failure for the Great Lakes Navigation System; and Whereas, The United States Congress has authorized the construction of a second Poe-sized lock, but a study that contains crucial errors is preventing the construction from proceeding: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of the 131st General Assembly of the State of Ohio, encourage the President and the Congress of the United States and the United States Office of Management and Budget to support plans to upgrade the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan; and be it further Resolved, That we encourage the United States Army Corps of Engineers to take expeditious action in acknowledging the national security need for maintaining the Great Lakes Navigation System in addition to properly accounting for the limitation of transportation resources if a lock outage occurs in the preparation of an Economic Reevaluation Report; and be it further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the members of the Ohio congressional delegation, the Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. ____ POM-152. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Wyoming urging the United States Congress to seek removal of the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations from listing under the Endangered Species Act and to assist in funding programs and services for gray wolf and grizzly bear management; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. House Joint Resolution 4 Whereas, gray wolf and grizzly bear predation on livestock and big game species is resulting in economic losses in the state of Wyoming; and Whereas, the cost to manage gray wolves and grizzly bears and to compensate individuals and entities for damage caused by these species is significantly greater than can be sustained through existing budgets of the responsible state and federal agencies; and Whereas, gray wolf and grizzly bear populations are recovered and these species should therefore be removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming in order for the state to effectively manage these species; and Whereas, federal funding is essential to assist the state in compensating individuals and entities for losses caused by gray wolves and grizzly bears now and after the date these species are removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming; and Whereas, such federal support in compensating individuals and entities for losses will increase acceptance of these wildlife species in Wyoming and continue the healthy and self-sustaining populations of gray wolves and grizzly bears in the state: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, by the Members of the Legislature of the State of Wyoming: Section 1. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress and the United States Fish and Wildlife Services to speedily seek removal of the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming, by all means available. Section 2. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress to immediately and fully fund all necessary programs and services for gray wolf and grizzly bear management, particularly programs and services to compensate individuals and entities for losses caused by these wildlife species. Section 3. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress to assist in funding the necessary programs and services indicated in section 2 of this resolution after the date the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations are removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species of threatened species in Wyoming. Section 4. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, to the Wyoming Congressional Delegation and to the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. ____ POM-153. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of Michigan supporting the recommendations of the Chicago Area Waterway System Advisory Committee to prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Resolution No. 12 Whereas, The Chicago Area Waterway System serves as a pathway for aquatic invasive species to move between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins. Zebra mussels and other species spread from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River and its tributaries through this man-made connection. Now, Asian carp are on the brink of using this same route to invade the Great Lakes from the Mississippi River basin; and [[Page S2127]] Whereas, Asian carp continue to migrate upstream and are now within a day's swim of Lake Michigan. In the last year, juvenile Asian carp have moved 66 miles closer to Lake Michigan, leaving them only 76 miles from the Great Lakes. While electrical barriers currently stand in their way, new research indicates that those barriers may not be effective at stopping small fish; and Whereas, The impacts of Asian carp to the ecosystems and economies of the Great Lakes states and local communities will be catastrophic. Invasive species established in the Great Lakes already cost the region more than $100 million per year. Asian carp could add dramatically to this cost if they move through the Chicago area into the Great Lakes. These carp are voracious filter feeders and could out-compete the native fish of the Great Lakes, threatening a $7 billion sport and commercial fishery. History has demonstrated that, once established, aquatic invasive species like Asian carp are nearly impossible to eradicate; and Whereas, The Chicago Area Waterway System Advisory Committee was formed in May 2014 with the goal of reaching consensus on a set of recommendations for elected and appointed local, state, and federal officials and the public on short- and long-term measures to prevent Asian carp and other aquatic invasive species from moving between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins through the Chicago Area Waterway System; and Whereas. The diverse, 32-member advisory committee reached consensus in a letter to the President of the United States on a specific system of control points to prevent the two-way interbasin transfer of aquatic invasive species. It also reached consensus on supporting immediate actions at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illinois, to prevent the risk of Asian carp from migrating upstream while the system of control points is evaluated as a long-term solution for all aquatic invasive species; and Whereas, The best long-term solution will prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes while preserving as much as possible the current uses of the Chicago area waterways. Options that would change shipping on these waterways should only be pursued after all other options have been exhausted; and Whereas, The costs of preventing Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes are substantially lower than the costs to the ecosystems and economies of the Great Lakes states if Asian carp were to become established: now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate, That we support the Chicago Area Waterway System Advisory Committee recommendations to implement immediate control technologies at Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illinois, and to further investigate the specific system of control points for long-term movement of aquatic invasive species into and out of the Great Lakes; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional delegation, and the Commanding General and Chief of Engineers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. ____ POM-154. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the United States Congress to take actions necessary to help families enduring mental health crisis; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. House Resolution No. 169 Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mental illness is defined as ``health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired function.'' The National Institute of Mental Health states, ``while mental disorders are common in the United States, the burden of illness is particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to serious mental illness (SMI)''; and Whereas, Laws, regulations, and misinterpretations frequently shut out families attempting to get effective and appropriate treatment for their loved ones in a mental health crisis. In a given year, approximately ten million Americans endure serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder. Approximately four million Americans battle with serious mental illness do not receive treatment in a given year; and Whereas, Families struggling with mental illness must also grapple with the likelihood that their loved one will end up in jail or prison where there is virtually no mental health treatment. There are ten times more individuals with serious mental illness in jails and prisons than in state psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, federal laws and billing policies restrict the ability of persons on Medicaid to receive high- quality inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment; and Whereas, Current spending needs to be more focused on the most effective services and most severe mental illnesses. Passage of federal legislation like the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015 (H.R. 2646), sponsored by United States Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, would be a positive first step. The bill would create a new Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders to coordinate funding between agencies, collect increased data on treatment outcomes, and drive evidence- based care: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, by the House of Representatives, That we memorialize the Congress of the United States to take actions necessary to help families enduring mental health crisis; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. ____ POM-155. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to restructure the United States Postal Service in a way that would reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the nation and provide acceptable delivery times; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Senate Joint Memorial No. 105 Whereas, the mail processing function of the post office in Pocatello, Idaho, was closed on or about April 19, 2015; and Whereas, Brian Sperry, the regional spokesman for the United States Postal Service (USPS) stated that the impacts would be that stamped ``First-Class Mail'' would take between two and three days to reach its destination; and Whereas, mail delivery in eastern Idaho is now significantly delayed, with delays ranging from a few days up to a few weeks; and Whereas, USPS has already closed or suspended services in many locations nationwide, including in Twin Falls, Idaho, and is considering closing more; and Whereas, USPS can provide better delivery times while still cutting substantive costs by restructuring its pre-funding for retirement benefits: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the members of the Second Regular Session of the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that Congress should pass legislation that would direct USPS to restructure their budget priorities, rethink their administrative model, make appropriate budget cuts if necessary, focus on customer service and acceptable delivery times, and reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the United States; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of this Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2125-S2127] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-147.

Section 1039 of the act authorizes $20 million for Columbia River Basin watercraft inspection stations to prevent introduction of Dreissenid mussels and other aquatic invasive species through the Secretary of the Army; and Whereas, the fiscal year 2016 budget for the United States Army Corps of Engineers includes $4 million in funding for watercraft inspection stations as authorized by the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, and the State of Idaho and Pacific Northwest Economic Region are grateful for the Corps' recognition of the severity of the threat of aquatic invasive species to the region and dedication to assist the region in enhancing prevention efforts: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the members of the Second Regular Session of the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that we respectfully request that Congress ensure the continued appropriation of these funds in the fiscal year 2017 budget to significantly enhance aquatic invasive species prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States. ____ POM-151. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Ohio encouraging the President of the United States, the United States Congress, and the United States Office of Management and Budget to support plans to upgrade the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and encourage the United States Army Corps of Engineers to take expeditious action in preparing an Economic Reevaluation Report; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. House Resolution Number 263 Whereas, The Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, are of the utmost importance to Ohio and play a critical role in the nation's economy and security. Each year, approximately 10,000 Great Lakes vessels, carrying 80 million tons of iron ore, coal, grain, and other cargo, safely and efficiently traverse the locks; and Whereas, Nearly 80% of all domestic iron ore, the primary material used to manufacture steel, travels from mines in Minnesota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula through the Soo Locks to steel producers in Ohio; and Whereas, Only one of the four Soo Locks, the Poe Lock, is large enough to accommodate the modem vessels that commonly traverse the Great Lakes. 70% of cargo is carried on these large ships that can only pass through the Poe Lock, and the remaining cargo must pass through the smaller MacArthur Lock. The 100-year-old Davis and Sabin Locks are rarely used as they are the smallest locks and cannot accommodate large modem vessels; and Whereas, The continued reliance on only the Poe Lock poses a serious risk to national security and the economies of not only the State of Ohio, but also the entire country. A long- term outage of the Poe Lock due to lock failure or a terrorist attack could cripple the economy and disrupt steel production in the United States. It is estimated that a 30- day outage of the Poe Lock would result in economic losses of $160 million; and Whereas, Upgrades to the Soo Locks are needed to ensure national security and unfettered commerce through the Great Lakes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers acknowledges that the Soo Locks are a single point of failure for the Great Lakes Navigation System; and Whereas, The United States Congress has authorized the construction of a second Poe-sized lock, but a study that contains crucial errors is preventing the construction from proceeding: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of the 131st General Assembly of the State of Ohio, encourage the President and the Congress of the United States and the United States Office of Management and Budget to support plans to upgrade the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan; and be it further Resolved, That we encourage the United States Army Corps of Engineers to take expeditious action in acknowledging the national security need for maintaining the Great Lakes Navigation System in addition to properly accounting for the limitation of transportation resources if a lock outage occurs in the preparation of an Economic Reevaluation Report; and be it further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the members of the Ohio congressional delegation, the Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. ____ POM-152. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Wyoming urging the United States Congress to seek removal of the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations from listing under the Endangered Species Act and to assist in funding programs and services for gray wolf and grizzly bear management; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. House Joint Resolution 4 Whereas, gray wolf and grizzly bear predation on livestock and big game species is resulting in economic losses in the state of Wyoming; and Whereas, the cost to manage gray wolves and grizzly bears and to compensate individuals and entities for damage caused by these species is significantly greater than can be sustained through existing budgets of the responsible state and federal agencies; and Whereas, gray wolf and grizzly bear populations are recovered and these species should therefore be removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming in order for the state to effectively manage these species; and Whereas, federal funding is essential to assist the state in compensating individuals and entities for losses caused by gray wolves and grizzly bears now and after the date these species are removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming; and Whereas, such federal support in compensating individuals and entities for losses will increase acceptance of these wildlife species in Wyoming and continue the healthy and self-sustaining populations of gray wolves and grizzly bears in the state: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, by the Members of the Legislature of the State of Wyoming: Section 1. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress and the United States Fish and Wildlife Services to speedily seek removal of the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming, by all means available. Section 2. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress to immediately and fully fund all necessary programs and services for gray wolf and grizzly bear management, particularly programs and services to compensate individuals and entities for losses caused by these wildlife species. Section 3. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress to assist in funding the necessary programs and services indicated in section 2 of this resolution after the date the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations are removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species of threatened species in Wyoming. Section 4. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, to the Wyoming Congressional Delegation and to the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. ____ POM-153. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of Michigan supporting the recommendations of the Chicago Area Waterway System Advisory Committee to prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Resolution No. 12 Whereas, The Chicago Area Waterway System serves as a pathway for aquatic invasive species to move between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins. Zebra mussels and other species spread from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River and its tributaries through this man-made connection. Now, Asian carp are on the brink of using this same route to invade the Great Lakes from the Mississippi River basin; and [[Page S2127]] Whereas, Asian carp continue to migrate upstream and are now within a day's swim of Lake Michigan. In the last year, juvenile Asian carp have moved 66 miles closer to Lake Michigan, leaving them only 76 miles from the Great Lakes. While electrical barriers currently stand in their way, new research indicates that those barriers may not be effective at stopping small fish; and Whereas, The impacts of Asian carp to the ecosystems and economies of the Great Lakes states and local communities will be catastrophic. Invasive species established in the Great Lakes already cost the region more than $100 million per year. Asian carp could add dramatically to this cost if they move through the Chicago area into the Great Lakes. These carp are voracious filter feeders and could out-compete the native fish of the Great Lakes, threatening a $7 billion sport and commercial fishery. History has demonstrated that, once established, aquatic invasive species like Asian carp are nearly impossible to eradicate; and Whereas, The Chicago Area Waterway System Advisory Committee was formed in May 2014 with the goal of reaching consensus on a set of recommendations for elected and appointed local, state, and federal officials and the public on short- and long-term measures to prevent Asian carp and other aquatic invasive species from moving between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins through the Chicago Area Waterway System; and Whereas. The diverse, 32-member advisory committee reached consensus in a letter to the President of the United States on a specific system of control points to prevent the two-way interbasin transfer of aquatic invasive species. It also reached consensus on supporting immediate actions at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illinois, to prevent the risk of Asian carp from migrating upstream while the system of control points is evaluated as a long-term solution for all aquatic invasive species; and Whereas, The best long-term solution will prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes while preserving as much as possible the current uses of the Chicago area waterways. Options that would change shipping on these waterways should only be pursued after all other options have been exhausted; and Whereas, The costs of preventing Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes are substantially lower than the costs to the ecosystems and economies of the Great Lakes states if Asian carp were to become established: now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate, That we support the Chicago Area Waterway System Advisory Committee recommendations to implement immediate control technologies at Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illinois, and to further investigate the specific system of control points for long-term movement of aquatic invasive species into and out of the Great Lakes; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional delegation, and the Commanding General and Chief of Engineers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. ____ POM-154. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the United States Congress to take actions necessary to help families enduring mental health crisis; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. House Resolution No. 169 Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mental illness is defined as ``health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired function.'' The National Institute of Mental Health states, ``while mental disorders are common in the United States, the burden of illness is particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to serious mental illness (SMI)''; and Whereas, Laws, regulations, and misinterpretations frequently shut out families attempting to get effective and appropriate treatment for their loved ones in a mental health crisis. In a given year, approximately ten million Americans endure serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder. Approximately four million Americans battle with serious mental illness do not receive treatment in a given year; and Whereas, Families struggling with mental illness must also grapple with the likelihood that their loved one will end up in jail or prison where there is virtually no mental health treatment. There are ten times more individuals with serious mental illness in jails and prisons than in state psychiatric hospitals. Moreover, federal laws and billing policies restrict the ability of persons on Medicaid to receive high- quality inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment; and Whereas, Current spending needs to be more focused on the most effective services and most severe mental illnesses. Passage of federal legislation like the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015 (H.R. 2646), sponsored by United States Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, would be a positive first step. The bill would create a new Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders to coordinate funding between agencies, collect increased data on treatment outcomes, and drive evidence- based care: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, by the House of Representatives, That we memorialize the Congress of the United States to take actions necessary to help families enduring mental health crisis; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. ____ POM-155. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to restructure the United States Postal Service in a way that would reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the nation and provide acceptable delivery times; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Senate Joint Memorial No. 105 Whereas, the mail processing function of the post office in Pocatello, Idaho, was closed on or about April 19, 2015; and Whereas, Brian Sperry, the regional spokesman for the United States Postal Service (USPS) stated that the impacts would be that stamped ``First-Class Mail'' would take between two and three days to reach its destination; and Whereas, mail delivery in eastern Idaho is now significantly delayed, with delays ranging from a few days up to a few weeks; and Whereas, USPS has already closed or suspended services in many locations nationwide, including in Twin Falls, Idaho, and is considering closing more; and Whereas, USPS can provide better delivery times while still cutting substantive costs by restructuring its pre-funding for retirement benefits: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the members of the Second Regular Session of the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that Congress should pass legislation that would direct USPS to restructure their budget priorities, rethink their administrative model, make appropriate budget cuts if necessary, focus on customer service and acceptable delivery times, and reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the United States; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of this Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Senate] [Pages S2125-S2127] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-147. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas urging the federal government to require the use of sound science in evaluating crop protection chemistries and nutrients; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. House Resolution No. 6045 Whereas, Agriculture is crucial to the continued production of food, feed, fiber and energy to meet both domestic and global demand; and Whereas, In the United States, the agriculture and value- added industries and businesses utilize precision farming equipment, crop protection chemistries, genetic engineering or enhancement, agricultural nutrients and other modern technologies. Such advanced practices protect the safety of the public and reduce environmental and natural resource impacts, while increasing yields, improving profitability and ensuring an abundant, affordable and wholesome food supply; and Whereas, Agricultural production systems and crop protection are among the most studied and highly regulated of all industries, at both the state and federal levels. The use of sound science should be the bedrock of our nation's regulatory scheme for the agriculture and food production industries, as these industries are critical to the economic vitality of Kansas and the United States: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas: That we support the use of sound science to study and regulate modern agricultural technologies such as crop protection chemistries and genetically engineered or enhanced traits and nutrients; and be it further Resolved, That we oppose legislative or regulatory action at any level that may result in unnecessary restrictions on the use of modern agricultural technologies. ____ POM-148. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas urging the President of the United States to obey the United States Constitution and declare that the detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay will remain; to the Committee on Armed Services. House Concurrent Resolution No. 5024 Whereas, The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has threatened to move the terrorist detainees currently held at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to Fort Leavenworth without regard to the wishes or the safety of the people of Kansas; and Whereas, The President has threatened to close the detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay; and Whereas, The threat of the transfer has been underscored by visits to Fort Leavenworth by officials of his Administration, preparing for the threatened transfer; and Whereas, Many detainees that have been released have continued to fight against this country and its allies; and Whereas, This President and others have insisted that the mere existence of the detention facility at Guantanamo has inflamed terrorists around the world and aided in their recruitments; and Whereas, Transferring the detainees to Fort Leavenworth will only transfer the ire of terrorists worldwide from Guantanamo to Fort Leavenworth; and Whereas, This President has a demonstrated willingness to violate American law; and Whereas, This President has said that he will go around the Congress to accomplish his agenda; and Whereas, Closing the Naval Station at Guantanamo has been high on this President's agenda since before he was first elected; and Whereas, The President has continually sought to weaken our standing in the world; and Whereas, The terrorists have demonstrated an ability and willingness to conduct attacks in America, in furtherance of their savage war against America; and Whereas, Detonating large bombs in civilian communities in the vicinity of Fort Leavenworth would be exactly the sort of demonstration that the terrorists would try; and Whereas, Fort Leavenworth does not have the necessary facilities to hold and care for the detainees and would, for example, be forced to transport them through the city of Leavenworth to access medical care, thereby presenting additional soft, tempting targets for attacks; and Whereas, The surrounding community does not have the law enforcement, emergency response resources or the physical capability to harden potential civilian targets in the surrounding area. Transferring detainees to Fort Leavenworth represents a predictable, direct and unnecessarily high risk to American citizens in the vicinity of Fort Leavenworth; and Whereas, The Naval Station at Guantanamo is a high security facility designed to both house high risk detainees and be secure from attack by external forces. This facility has not been the object of an external terrorist attack and, if it had been attacked, it would not have represented a threat to American civilians or communities; and Whereas, The intentional placement of detainees on American soil, physically within an American community, would unnecessarily and intentionally put American citizens at much greater risk. It follows that any move by the President or other members of the Federal, State or local government to move the detainees to Fort Leavenworth would mean intentionally and knowingly placing American citizens at greater risk, in violation of the government's sworn oath to support and defend them against enemies, foreign or domestic; and Whereas, Officers from over one hundred countries attend classes at Fort Leavenworth; and Whereas, Many of these officers would not bring their families nor be permitted by their countries to attend, if the detainees were transferred to Fort Leavenworth, thereby hurting the local economy; and Whereas, These officers and their families represent an important bond and link among our nations. Their loss will not just affect the local economy, but would potentially have grave impacts on our future ability to effectively and successfully find peaceful solutions to international problems: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Legislature of the State of Kansas urges the President of the United States to obey the Constitution of the United States and the laws of this country, the people of which have placed him in a position of great trust and responsibility and depend upon him to ensure that the laws be upheld and that their security be maintained; and be it further Resolved, That the President must declare that the detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay will remain, and that the detainees will continue to be held there, until said detainees are given proper, lawful disposition, in accordance with the Laws of War and the best interests of the safety of the people of the United States and their allies. ____ POM-149. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urging the United States Congress to modernize the federal cap on the locally set Passenger Facility Charges user fee by setting it at $8.50 and adjusting it periodically to offset the impacts of inflation; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Senate Resolution No. 261 Whereas, In 2010, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's public use airports supported approximately 304,000 jobs, generated $9.2 billion in annual payroll and produced $23.6 billion in annual economic activities; and Whereas, In 1990, the Congress of the United States authorized Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs), local user fees collected for every boarded passenger, to help airports of all sizes meet their capital needs to finance Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved projects such as terminals, parking and multimodal projects that enhance safety, security, capacity, noise reduction or increase air carrier competition; and Whereas, PFCs are locally determined fees collected at the point of sale, which do not affect Federal expenditures; and Whereas, The PFC cap was last raised in 2000 when Congress set it at $4.50; and Whereas, Inflation has eroded the buying power of PFCs by approximately one-half since then due to rising construction costs; and Whereas, There is a growing recognition of the need for infrastructure finance and funding to keep pace with inflation and action for doing so such as the act of November 25, 2014 (P.L. 974, No. 89) in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and Whereas, Modernizing the PFC cap to $8.50 now and indexing it for inflation would restore its original purchasing power and provide local communities with the ability to set their individual PFC user fees based on locally determined needs for ensuring the safety and security of their airports; and Whereas, Over the next five years, airports will require more than $75 billion to improve infrastructure to prevent passenger delays and congestion; and Whereas, Direct Federal funding through the FAA Airport Improvement Program has declined 10% over the past six years and covers only a fraction of the total infrastructure projects required to upgrade and maintain the world-class aviation system: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United States to modernize the Federal cap on the locally set PFC user fee by setting it at $8.50 and adjusting it periodically to offset the impacts of inflation; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution to be sent to the President of the United States, the presiding officers of each house of [[Page S2126]] Congress and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania. ____ POM-150. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to ensure the continued appropriation of watercraft inspection station funding in the fiscal year 2017 budget to significantly enhance aquatic invasive species prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Joint Memorial No. 104 Whereas, maintaining a healthy suite of economic, environmental and social ecosystem services in aquatic systems is integral to the quality of life in the State of Idaho; and Whereas, healthy aquatic habitats provide clean drinking water, flood control, transportation, recreation, purification of human and industrial wastes, power generation, habitat for native plants and animals, production of fish and other foods, marketable goods and cultural benefits; and Whereas, Dreissenid mussels, specifically quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), are aquatic invasive species that cause irreparable ecological damage to many waters in the United States; and Whereas, Dreissenids have not yet been detected in the Pacific Northwest.

Moreover, federal laws and billing policies restrict the ability of persons on Medicaid to receive high- quality inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment; and Whereas, Current spending needs to be more focused on the most effective services and most severe mental illnesses. Passage of federal legislation like the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015 (H.R. 2646), sponsored by United States Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, would be a positive first step. The bill would create a new Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders to coordinate funding between agencies, collect increased data on treatment outcomes, and drive evidence- based care: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, by the House of Representatives, That we memorialize the Congress of the United States to take actions necessary to help families enduring mental health crisis; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. ____ POM-155. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to restructure the United States Postal Service in a way that would reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the nation and provide acceptable delivery times; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Senate Joint Memorial No. 105 Whereas, the mail processing function of the post office in Pocatello, Idaho, was closed on or about April 19, 2015; and Whereas, Brian Sperry, the regional spokesman for the United States Postal Service (USPS) stated that the impacts would be that stamped ``First-Class Mail'' would take between two and three days to reach its destination; and Whereas, mail delivery in eastern Idaho is now significantly delayed, with delays ranging from a few days up to a few weeks; and Whereas, USPS has already closed or suspended services in many locations nationwide, including in Twin Falls, Idaho, and is considering closing more; and Whereas, USPS can provide better delivery times while still cutting substantive costs by restructuring its pre-funding for retirement benefits: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the members of the Second Regular Session of the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that Congress should pass legislation that would direct USPS to restructure their budget priorities, rethink their administrative model, make appropriate budget cuts if necessary, focus on customer service and acceptable delivery times, and reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the United States; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of this Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States. ____________________",package_114_165.csv,27980,27980,28047,"[congressional record volume 162, number 59 (monday, april 18, 2016)] [senate] [pages s2125-s2127] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] petitions and memorials the following petitions and memorials were laid before the senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: pom-147. a resolution adopted by the house of representatives of the state of kansas urging the federal government to require the use of sound science in evaluating crop protection chemistries and nutrients; to the committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry. house resolution no. 6045 whereas, agriculture is crucial to the continued production of food, feed, fiber and energy to meet both domestic and global demand; and whereas, in the united states, the agriculture and value- added industries and businesses utilize precision farming equipment, crop protection chemistries, genetic engineering or enhancement, agricultural nutrients and other modern technologies. such advanced practices protect the safety of the public and reduce environmental and natural resource impacts, while increasing yields, improving profitability and ensuring an abundant, affordable and wholesome food supply; and whereas, agricultural production systems and crop protection are among the most studied and highly regulated of all industries, at both the state and federal levels. the use of sound science should be the bedrock of our nation's regulatory scheme for the agriculture and food production industries, as these industries are critical to the economic vitality of kansas and the united states: now, therefore, be it resolved, by the house of representatives of the state of kansas: that we support the use of sound science to study and regulate modern agricultural technologies such as crop protection chemistries and genetically engineered or enhanced traits and nutrients; and be it further resolved, that we oppose legislative or regulatory action at any level that may result in unnecessary restrictions on the use of modern agricultural technologies. ____ pom-148. a concurrent resolution adopted by the legislature of the state of kansas urging the president of the united states to obey the united states constitution and declare that the detention facility at naval station guantanamo bay will remain; to the committee on armed services. house concurrent resolution no. 5024 whereas, the president of the united states, barack obama, has threatened to move the terrorist detainees currently held at naval station guantanamo bay to fort leavenworth without regard to the wishes or the safety of the people of kansas; and whereas, the president has threatened to close the detention facility at naval station guantanamo bay; and whereas, the threat of the transfer has been underscored by visits to fort leavenworth by officials of his administration, preparing for the threatened transfer; and whereas, many detainees that have been released have continued to fight against this country and its allies; and whereas, this president and others have insisted that the mere existence of the detention facility at guantanamo has inflamed terrorists around the world and aided in their recruitments; and whereas, transferring the detainees to fort leavenworth will only transfer the ire of terrorists worldwide from guantanamo to fort leavenworth; and whereas, this president has a demonstrated willingness to violate american law; and whereas, this president has said that he will go around the congress to accomplish his agenda; and whereas, closing the naval station at guantanamo has been high on this president's agenda since before he was first elected; and whereas, the president has continually sought to weaken our standing in the world; and whereas, the terrorists have demonstrated an ability and willingness to conduct attacks in america, in furtherance of their savage war against america; and whereas, detonating large bombs in civilian communities in the vicinity of fort leavenworth would be exactly the sort of demonstration that the terrorists would try; and whereas, fort leavenworth does not have the necessary facilities to hold and care for the detainees and would, for example, be forced to transport them through the city of leavenworth to access medical care, thereby presenting additional soft, tempting targets for attacks; and whereas, the surrounding community does not have the law enforcement, emergency response resources or the physical capability to harden potential civilian targets in the surrounding area. transferring detainees to fort leavenworth represents a predictable, direct and unnecessarily high risk to american citizens in the vicinity of fort leavenworth; and whereas, the naval station at guantanamo is a high security facility designed to both house high risk detainees and be secure from attack by external forces. this facility has not been the object of an external terrorist attack and, if it had been attacked, it would not have represented a threat to american civilians or communities; and whereas, the intentional placement of detainees on american soil, physically within an american community, would unnecessarily and intentionally put american citizens at much greater risk. it follows that any move by the president or other members of the federal, state or local government to move the detainees to fort leavenworth would mean intentionally and knowingly placing american citizens at greater risk, in violation of the government's sworn oath to support and defend them against enemies, foreign or domestic; and whereas, officers from over one hundred countries attend classes at fort leavenworth; and whereas, many of these officers would not bring their families nor be permitted by their countries to attend, if the detainees were transferred to fort leavenworth, thereby hurting the local economy; and whereas, these officers and their families represent an important bond and link among our nations. their loss will not just affect the local economy, but would potentially have grave impacts on our future ability to effectively and successfully find peaceful solutions to international problems: now, therefore, be it resolved by the house of representatives of the state of kansas, the senate concurring therein, that the legislature of the state of kansas urges the president of the united states to obey the constitution of the united states and the laws of this country, the people of which have placed him in a position of great trust and responsibility and depend upon him to ensure that the laws be upheld and that their security be maintained; and be it further resolved, that the president must declare that the detention facility at naval station guantanamo bay will remain, and that the detainees will continue to be held there, until said detainees are given proper, lawful disposition, in accordance with the laws of war and the best interests of the safety of the people of the united states and their allies. ____ pom-149. a resolution adopted by the senate of the commonwealth of pennsylvania urging the united states congress to modernize the federal cap on the locally set passenger facility charges user fee by setting it at $8.50 and adjusting it periodically to offset the impacts of inflation; to the committee on commerce, science, and transportation. senate resolution no. 261 whereas, in 2010, the commonwealth of pennsylvania's public use airports supported approximately 304,000 jobs, generated $9.2 billion in annual payroll and produced $23.6 billion in annual economic activities; and whereas, in 1990, the congress of the united states authorized passenger facility charges (pfcs), local user fees collected for every boarded passenger, to help airports of all sizes meet their capital needs to finance federal aviation administration (faa) approved projects such as terminals, parking and multimodal projects that enhance safety, security, capacity, noise reduction or increase air carrier competition; and whereas, pfcs are locally determined fees collected at the point of sale, which do not affect federal expenditures; and whereas, the pfc cap was last raised in 2000 when congress set it at $4.50; and whereas, inflation has eroded the buying power of pfcs by approximately one-half since then due to rising construction costs; and whereas, there is a growing recognition of the need for infrastructure finance and funding to keep pace with inflation and action for doing so such as the act of november 25, 2014 (p.l. 974, no. 89) in the commonwealth of pennsylvania; and whereas, modernizing the pfc cap to $8.50 now and indexing it for inflation would restore its original purchasing power and provide local communities with the ability to set their individual pfc user fees based on locally determined needs for ensuring the safety and security of their airports; and whereas, over the next five years, airports will require more than $75 billion to improve infrastructure to prevent passenger delays and congestion; and whereas, direct federal funding through the faa airport improvement program has declined 10% over the past six years and covers only a fraction of the total infrastructure projects required to upgrade and maintain the world-class aviation system: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the senate of the commonwealth of pennsylvania urge the congress of the united states to modernize the federal cap on the locally set pfc user fee by setting it at $8.50 and adjusting it periodically to offset the impacts of inflation; and be it further resolved, that a copy of this resolution to be sent to the president of the united states, the presiding officers of each house of [[page s2126]] congress and to each member of congress from pennsylvania. ____ pom-150. a joint memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of idaho urging the united states congress to ensure the continued appropriation of watercraft inspection station funding in the fiscal year 2017 budget to significantly enhance aquatic invasive species prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the water resources reform and development act; to the committee on environment and public works. senate joint memorial no. 104 whereas, maintaining a healthy suite of economic, environmental and social ecosystem services in aquatic systems is integral to the quality of life in the state of idaho; and whereas, healthy aquatic habitats provide clean drinking water, flood control, transportation, recreation, purification of human and industrial wastes, power generation, habitat for native plants and animals, production of fish and other foods, marketable goods and cultural benefits; and whereas, dreissenid mussels, specifically quagga mussels (dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra mussels (dreissena polymorpha), are aquatic invasive species that cause irreparable ecological damage to many waters in the united states; and whereas, dreissenids have not yet been detected in the pacific northwest. the estimated annual cost to address established populations of dreissenids in the pacific northwest economic region is almost $0.5 billion annually; and whereas, the water resources reform and development act was signed in june 2014. section 1039 of the act authorizes $20 million for columbia river basin watercraft inspection stations to prevent introduction of dreissenid mussels and other aquatic invasive species through the secretary of the army; and whereas, the fiscal year 2016 budget for the united states army corps of engineers includes $4 million in funding for watercraft inspection stations as authorized by the water resources reform and development act, and the state of idaho and pacific northwest economic region are grateful for the corps' recognition of the severity of the threat of aquatic invasive species to the region and dedication to assist the region in enhancing prevention efforts: now, therefore, be it resolved, by the members of the second regular session of the sixty-third idaho legislature, the senate and the house of representatives concurring therein, that we respectfully request that congress ensure the continued appropriation of these funds in the fiscal year 2017 budget to significantly enhance aquatic invasive species prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the water resources reform and development act; and be it further resolved, that the secretary of the senate be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this memorial to the president of the united states, the secretary of the army, the secretary of the interior, the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives of congress, and the congressional delegation representing the state of idaho in the congress of the united states. ____ pom-151. a resolution adopted by the house of representatives of the state of ohio encouraging the president of the united states, the united states congress, and the united states office of management and budget to support plans to upgrade the soo locks at sault ste. marie, michigan, and encourage the united states army corps of engineers to take expeditious action in preparing an economic reevaluation report; to the committee on environment and public works. house resolution number 263 whereas, the soo locks at sault ste. marie, michigan, are of the utmost importance to ohio and play a critical role in the nation's economy and security. each year, approximately 10,000 great lakes vessels, carrying 80 million tons of iron ore, coal, grain, and other cargo, safely and efficiently traverse the locks; and whereas, nearly 80% of all domestic iron ore, the primary material used to manufacture steel, travels from mines in minnesota and michigan's upper peninsula through the soo locks to steel producers in ohio; and whereas, only one of the four soo locks, the poe lock, is large enough to accommodate the modem vessels that commonly traverse the great lakes. 70% of cargo is carried on these large ships that can only pass through the poe lock, and the remaining cargo must pass through the smaller macarthur lock. the 100-year-old davis and sabin locks are rarely used as they are the smallest locks and cannot accommodate large modem vessels; and whereas, the continued reliance on only the poe lock poses a serious risk to national security and the economies of not only the state of ohio, but also the entire country. a long- term outage of the poe lock due to lock failure or a terrorist attack could cripple the economy and disrupt steel production in the united states. it is estimated that a 30- day outage of the poe lock would result in economic losses of $160 million; and whereas, upgrades to the soo locks are needed to ensure national security and unfettered commerce through the great lakes. the united states army corps of engineers acknowledges that the soo locks are a single point of failure for the great lakes navigation system; and whereas, the united states congress has authorized the construction of a second poe-sized lock, but a study that contains crucial errors is preventing the construction from proceeding: now, therefore, be it resolved, that we, the members of the house of representatives of the 131st general assembly of the state of ohio, encourage the president and the congress of the united states and the united states office of management and budget to support plans to upgrade the soo locks at sault ste. marie, michigan; and be it further resolved, that we encourage the united states army corps of engineers to take expeditious action in acknowledging the national security need for maintaining the great lakes navigation system in addition to properly accounting for the limitation of transportation resources if a lock outage occurs in the preparation of an economic reevaluation report; and be it further resolved, that the clerk of the house of representatives transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the president of the united states, the president pro tempore and secretary of the united states senate, the speaker and clerk of the united states house of representatives, the members of the ohio congressional delegation, the director of the united states office of management and budget, and the assistant secretary of the army for civil works. ____ pom-152. a joint resolution adopted by the legislature of the state of wyoming urging the united states congress to seek removal of the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations from listing under the endangered species act and to assist in funding programs and services for gray wolf and grizzly bear management; to the committee on environment and public works. house joint resolution 4 whereas, gray wolf and grizzly bear predation on livestock and big game species is resulting in economic losses in the state of wyoming; and whereas, the cost to manage gray wolves and grizzly bears and to compensate individuals and entities for damage caused by these species is significantly greater than can be sustained through existing budgets of the responsible state and federal agencies; and whereas, gray wolf and grizzly bear populations are recovered and these species should therefore be removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in wyoming in order for the state to effectively manage these species; and whereas, federal funding is essential to assist the state in compensating individuals and entities for losses caused by gray wolves and grizzly bears now and after the date these species are removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in wyoming; and whereas, such federal support in compensating individuals and entities for losses will increase acceptance of these wildlife species in wyoming and continue the healthy and self-sustaining populations of gray wolves and grizzly bears in the state: now, therefore, be it resolved, by the members of the legislature of the state of wyoming: section 1. that the wyoming legislature calls on congress and the united states fish and wildlife services to speedily seek removal of the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in wyoming, by all means available. section 2. that the wyoming legislature calls on congress to immediately and fully fund all necessary programs and services for gray wolf and grizzly bear management, particularly programs and services to compensate individuals and entities for losses caused by these wildlife species. section 3. that the wyoming legislature calls on congress to assist in funding the necessary programs and services indicated in section 2 of this resolution after the date the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations are removed from the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered species of threatened species in wyoming. section 4. that the secretary of state of wyoming transmit copies of this resolution to the president of the united states, to the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives of the united states congress, to the wyoming congressional delegation and to the director of the united states fish and wildlife service. ____ pom-153. a resolution adopted by the senate of the state of michigan supporting the recommendations of the chicago area waterway system advisory committee to prevent asian carp from entering the great lakes; to the committee on environment and public works. senate resolution no. 12 whereas, the chicago area waterway system serves as a pathway for aquatic invasive species to move between the great lakes and mississippi river basins. zebra mussels and other species spread from the great lakes to the mississippi river and its tributaries through this man-made connection. now, asian carp are on the brink of using this same route to invade the great lakes from the mississippi river basin; and [[page s2127]] whereas, asian carp continue to migrate upstream and are now within a day's swim of lake michigan. in the last year, juvenile asian carp have moved 66 miles closer to lake michigan, leaving them only 76 miles from the great lakes. while electrical barriers currently stand in their way, new research indicates that those barriers may not be effective at stopping small fish; and whereas, the impacts of asian carp to the ecosystems and economies of the great lakes states and local communities will be catastrophic. invasive species established in the great lakes already cost the region more than $100 million per year. asian carp could add dramatically to this cost if they move through the chicago area into the great lakes. these carp are voracious filter feeders and could out-compete the native fish of the great lakes, threatening a $7 billion sport and commercial fishery. history has demonstrated that, once established, aquatic invasive species like asian carp are nearly impossible to eradicate; and whereas, the chicago area waterway system advisory committee was formed in may 2014 with the goal of reaching consensus on a set of recommendations for elected and appointed local, state, and federal officials and the public on short- and long-term measures to prevent asian carp and other aquatic invasive species from moving between the great lakes and mississippi river basins through the chicago area waterway system; and whereas. the diverse, 32-member advisory committee reached consensus in a letter to the president of the united states on a specific system of control points to prevent the two-way interbasin transfer of aquatic invasive species. it also reached consensus on supporting immediate actions at the brandon road lock and dam in joliet, illinois, to prevent the risk of asian carp from migrating upstream while the system of control points is evaluated as a long-term solution for all aquatic invasive species; and whereas, the best long-term solution will prevent asian carp from entering the great lakes while preserving as much as possible the current uses of the chicago area waterways. options that would change shipping on these waterways should only be pursued after all other options have been exhausted; and whereas, the costs of preventing asian carp from entering the great lakes are substantially lower than the costs to the ecosystems and economies of the great lakes states if asian carp were to become established: now, therefore, be it resolved by the senate, that we support the chicago area waterway system advisory committee recommendations to implement immediate control technologies at brandon road lock and dam in joliet, illinois, and to further investigate the specific system of control points for long-term movement of aquatic invasive species into and out of the great lakes; and be it further resolved, that copies of this resolution be transmitted to the president of the united states, president of the united states senate, the speaker of the united states house of representatives, the members of the michigan congressional delegation, and the commanding general and chief of engineers of the united states army corps of engineers. ____ pom-154. a resolution adopted by the house of representatives of the state of michigan memorializing the united states congress to take actions necessary to help families enduring mental health crisis; to the committee on health, education, labor, and pensions. house resolution no. 169 whereas, according to the centers for disease control and prevention, mental illness is defined as ``health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired function.'' the national institute of mental health states, ``while mental disorders are common in the united states, the burden of illness is particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to serious mental illness (smi)''; and whereas, laws, regulations, and misinterpretations frequently shut out families attempting to get effective and appropriate treatment for their loved ones in a mental health crisis. in a given year, approximately ten million americans endure serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar disorder. approximately four million americans battle with serious mental illness do not receive treatment in a given year; and whereas, families struggling with mental illness must also grapple with the likelihood that their loved one will end up in jail or prison where there is virtually no mental health treatment. there are ten times more individuals with serious mental illness in jails and prisons than in state psychiatric hospitals. moreover, federal laws and billing policies restrict the ability of persons on medicaid to receive high- quality inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment; and whereas, current spending needs to be more focused on the most effective services and most severe mental illnesses. passage of federal legislation like the helping families in mental health crisis act of 2015 (h.r. 2646), sponsored by united states congressman tim murphy of pennsylvania, would be a positive first step. the bill would create a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use disorders to coordinate funding between agencies, collect increased data on treatment outcomes, and drive evidence- based care: now, therefore, be it resolved, by the house of representatives, that we memorialize the congress of the united states to take actions necessary to help families enduring mental health crisis; and be it further resolved, that copies of this resolution be transmitted to the president of the united states senate, the speaker of the united states house of representatives, and the members of the michigan congressional delegation. ____ pom-155. a joint memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of idaho urging the united states congress to restructure the united states postal service in a way that would reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the nation and provide acceptable delivery times; to the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs. senate joint memorial no. 105 whereas, the mail processing function of the post office in pocatello, idaho, was closed on or about april 19, 2015; and whereas, brian sperry, the regional spokesman for the united states postal service (usps) stated that the impacts would be that stamped ``first-class mail'' would take between two and three days to reach its destination; and whereas, mail delivery in eastern idaho is now significantly delayed, with delays ranging from a few days up to a few weeks; and whereas, usps has already closed or suspended services in many locations nationwide, including in twin falls, idaho, and is considering closing more; and whereas, usps can provide better delivery times while still cutting substantive costs by restructuring its pre-funding for retirement benefits: now, therefore, be it resolved, by the members of the second regular session of the sixty-third idaho legislature, the senate and the house of representatives concurring therein, that congress should pass legislation that would direct usps to restructure their budget priorities, rethink their administrative model, make appropriate budget cuts if necessary, focus on customer service and acceptable delivery times, and reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the united states; and be it further resolved, that the secretary of the senate be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this memorial to the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives of this congress, and the congressional delegation representing the state of idaho in the congress of the united states. ____________________",27980

CREC-2016-04-18-pt1-PgE499-2,CREC-2016-04-18,114,ADDING ZIKA VIRUS TO THE FDA PRIORITY REVIEW VOUCHER PROGRAM ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E499-E500] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDING ZIKA VIRUS TO THE FDA PRIORITY REVIEW VOUCHER PROGRAM ACT ______ speech of HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. of new jersey in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 12, 2016 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to S. 2512, which would add Zika to the list of qualified tropical diseases under the Food and Drug Administration's Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program. While I know that we would all agree that there is desperate need for a treatment for Zika, I do not believe that this legislation offers the solution that will help us to achieve that goal. Further, I am disappointed that this legislation has not had the benefit of any legislative action in our Committee where Members could discuss in greater detail the need for reforms to the currently flawed priority review voucher program. In 2007, Congress established the Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program at FDA to incentivize treatments for neglected tropical diseases for which there was no market incentives to develop. Sponsors that develop a treatment for a qualified tropical disease are awarded a priority review voucher and have the option of retaining this voucher for a shortened review of another product in their development pipeline, or can sell the voucher to another company to use. Since enactment, three vouchers have been awarded under this program, two of which sold for $67 million and $125 million respectively. The value of the vouchers to sponsors has led to the development of the priority review voucher as a financial incentive in other areas, such as rare pediatric diseases. However, this program is not without flaws. Use of priority review vouchers is not limited to additional tropical disease products, meaning that companies can use this voucher for a review in six months of any product of its choosing. This can result in new drug applications receiving priority review that would not otherwise qualify if they do not treat a serious disease or condition, or offer a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. In practice, this allows companies to ``purchase'' services from the agency at the expense of other important public health work, undermining FDA's mission and the morale of the agency's review staff. It also creates additional workload for the FDA by requiring a shortened review of applications for treatments that will be used in millions of patients and diverting review staff from other work. Finally, the additional priority review voucher fee associated with use of the voucher has not been effective in covering the full cost of the expedited review. In addition to effects on FDA, the current tropical disease priority review voucher program contains two additional flaws--eligibility for this program is not limited to novel therapies, nor are sponsors required to make the qualifying therapy available or accessible for those who are most in need. Two of the three priority review vouchers awarded under this program were awarded to therapies that were already in use in other countries prior to the program's establishment. Thus a voucher was awarded to sponsors without any new investment in tropical disease treatments. Similarly, patients and other organizations still struggle to access two of the three therapies awarded a priority review voucher either due to affordability or lack of availability. An award such as a priority review voucher should only be given to companies who are committed to making their therapy available to patients in disease- endemic countries for which the program is intended to help. As we consider the bill before us today, it is important to note that FDA has the authority to add Zika to the tropical diseases program administratively if there is no significant market in developed nations for that disease and the disease disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations. I will submit a letter from FDA noting that it is ``extremely unlikely that the Zika virus meets the criteria set out in the statute'' as there is a significant market for medical products for Zika virus currently. According to the agency, expanding the program to include Zika, which would be ineligible, would weaken the effectiveness of the priority review program and would create an undue burden on FDA. Mr. Speaker, it is for all of these reasons that I am opposing S. 2512 today. It is clear there are significant issues with the tropical disease priority review voucher program that should have been discussed and considered as a part of the Committee process. Unfortunately, we were not afforded that opportunity. If the goal of the House is to address the Zika crisis, we should not be expanding a flawed program that will provide incentives for which there is no need. Instead Congress should be working together, including with the Administration, to fully fund a comprehensive response to Zika. I submit the following letter: Department of Health & Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, February 29, 2016. Dear Member: Thank you for your letter of February 05, 2016, urging the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) to add Zika virus to the list of qualified tropical diseases under the Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) Program by issuing an order, as authorized by the Adding Ebola to the FDA Priority Review Program Act [PL 113- 233]. FDA is actively working on many fronts to help mitigate the Zika virus outbreak. The Agency's primary areas of activity include: (1) protecting the safety of the nation's blood supply and ensuring the safety of cell and tissue products; (2) facilitating the development and availability of blood donor screening and medical diagnostic tests for identification of the presence of, or prior exposure to, Zika virus; (3) supporting the development of investigational vaccines and therapeutics; (4) reviewing proposals for the use of innovative strategies to help suppress the population of virus-carrying mosquitoes; (5) protecting the public from fraudulent products that claim to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure Zika virus disease. Specific activities include issuing guidance to blood collection centers on safeguards to prevent transfusion transmission of Zika virus in areas of the U.S. and its territories with active mosquito borne transmission (currently Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and Marshall Islands), and in unaffected areas where the virus might be introduced by persons returning from affected areas. FDA is also developing guidance that will address appropriate donor screening for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products: concerns in this area have been highlighted by reported possible sexual transmission of the Zika virus. FDA is reaching out to potential commercial product manufacturers to encourage them to develop and submit applications for emergency use of diagnostic tests for the Zika virus. In addition, FDA is actively engaged with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to advance the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, therapeutics, and donor screening and pathogen-reduction technologies for blood products to help mitigate this outbreak. These efforts have already realized a major success. On February 26, 2016, under its Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority, FDA authorized the use of a Zika virus diagnostic test--developed by CDC-- for the qualitative detection of Zika virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies by qualified laboratories. This diagnostic test can help expand domestic readiness for Zika virus by enabling the identification of patients recently infected with Zika virus in support of response efforts. As you are aware, under section 524 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to add infectious diseases to the list of tropical diseases that would qualify the developer of a licensed or approved product to prevent or treat an identified tropical disease to receive a PRV under FDA's Tropical Disease PRV Program, if: (1) there is no significant market in developed nations for that disease; and (2) the disease disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations. This authority is delegated to FDA. FDA has provided a process for requesting that additional diseases be added to the PRV list through the submission of a request to a special docket set up to facilitate the consideration of such requests, accompanied by information to document that the disease meets the statutory criteria required to be added to the PRV list. While FDA has not received a request to add the Zika virus to the PRV list via the docket, the Agency does not want to foreclose anyone from following that process and will evaluate any submissions that are made with respect to the Zika virus. FDA wants to make it clear, however, that--based on the information currently available to FDA--it is extremely unlikely that the Zika virus meets the criteria set out in the [[Page E500]] statute. While it appears likely that the Zika virus disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations, it also appears that there is a significant market for the Zika virus medical products in developed nations, which would render the Zika virus ineligible for addition to the PRV list under the statute at this time. FDA agrees that we need to do all that we can to facilitate the development of and access to medical products as quickly as possible to respond to the Zika virus outbreak. We fully believe that the incentives currently available for the Zika product development--such as funding for research and development, and clinical trial costs from government and non-governmental organizations--as well as extensive HHS technical assistance for product developers, are sufficient to help bring Zika products to market. FDA is fully prepared to use its authorities to the fullest extent appropriate-- including proven mechanisms to speed the availability of medical products for serious diseases--to help facilitate the development and availability of products with the potential to mitigate this outbreak as quickly as the science will allow. However, expanding the PRV program by adding diseases or conditions that do not meet the criteria for inclusion is unnecessary, weakens the effectiveness of the PRV program, and creates an undue burden on FDA that can ultimately harm public health. As you are aware, the Administration has asked Congress for approximately $1.9 billion in emergency funding to enhance our ongoing efforts to prepare for and respond to the Zika virus, both domestically and internationally. Approving this funding request, which includes support for medical product development and procurement, is essential for sustaining HHS's effort to effectively incentivize the development and availability of medical products for the Zika virus. Thank you, again, for contacting us concerning this matter. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. The same letter has been sent to your cosigners. Sincerely, Dayle Cristinzio, Acting Associate Commissioner for Legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E499-E500] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDING ZIKA VIRUS TO THE FDA PRIORITY REVIEW VOUCHER PROGRAM ACT ______ speech of HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. of new jersey in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 12, 2016 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to S. 2512, which would add Zika to the list of qualified tropical diseases under the Food and Drug Administration's Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program. While I know that we would all agree that there is desperate need for a treatment for Zika, I do not believe that this legislation offers the solution that will help us to achieve that goal. Further, I am disappointed that this legislation has not had the benefit of any legislative action in our Committee where Members could discuss in greater detail the need for reforms to the currently flawed priority review voucher program. In 2007, Congress established the Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program at FDA to incentivize treatments for neglected tropical diseases for which there was no market incentives to develop. Sponsors that develop a treatment for a qualified tropical disease are awarded a priority review voucher and have the option of retaining this voucher for a shortened review of another product in their development pipeline, or can sell the voucher to another company to use. Since enactment, three vouchers have been awarded under this program, two of which sold for $67 million and $125 million respectively. The value of the vouchers to sponsors has led to the development of the priority review voucher as a financial incentive in other areas, such as rare pediatric diseases. However, this program is not without flaws. Use of priority review vouchers is not limited to additional tropical disease products, meaning that companies can use this voucher for a review in six months of any product of its choosing. This can result in new drug applications receiving priority review that would not otherwise qualify if they do not treat a serious disease or condition, or offer a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.

silver spring, md, february 29, 2016. dear member: thank you for your letter of february 05, 2016, urging the food and drug administration (fda or the agency) to add zika virus to the list of qualified tropical diseases under the tropical disease priority review voucher (prv) program by issuing an order, as authorized by the adding ebola to the fda priority review program act [pl 113- 233]. fda is actively working on many fronts to help mitigate the zika virus outbreak. the agency's primary areas of activity include: (1) protecting the safety of the nation's blood supply and ensuring the safety of cell and tissue products; (2) facilitating the development and availability of blood donor screening and medical diagnostic tests for identification of the presence of, or prior exposure to, zika virus; (3) supporting the development of investigational vaccines and therapeutics; (4) reviewing proposals for the use of innovative strategies to help suppress the population of virus-carrying mosquitoes; (5) protecting the public from fraudulent products that claim to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure zika virus disease. specific activities include issuing guidance to blood collection centers on safeguards to prevent transfusion transmission of zika virus in areas of the u.s. and its territories with active mosquito borne transmission (currently puerto rico, u.s. virgin islands, american samoa and marshall islands), and in unaffected areas where the virus might be introduced by persons returning from affected areas. fda is also developing guidance that will address appropriate donor screening for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products: concerns in this area have been highlighted by reported possible sexual transmission of the zika virus. fda is reaching out to potential commercial product manufacturers to encourage them to develop and submit applications for emergency use of diagnostic tests for the zika virus. in addition, fda is actively engaged with the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response (aspr), the biomedical advanced research and development authority (barda), the national institutes of health (nih), and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) to advance the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, therapeutics, and donor screening and pathogen-reduction technologies for blood products to help mitigate this outbreak. these efforts have already realized a major success. on february 26, 2016, under its emergency use authorization (eua) authority, fda authorized the use of a zika virus diagnostic test--developed by cdc-- for the qualitative detection of zika virus-specific immunoglobulin m (igm) antibodies by qualified laboratories. this diagnostic test can help expand domestic readiness for zika virus by enabling the identification of patients recently infected with zika virus in support of response efforts. as you are aware, under section 524 of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act, the secretary of health and human services is authorized to add infectious diseases to the list of tropical diseases that would qualify the developer of a licensed or approved product to prevent or treat an identified tropical disease to receive a prv under fda's tropical disease prv program, if: (1) there is no significant market in developed nations for that disease; and (2) the disease disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations. this authority is delegated to fda. fda has provided a process for requesting that additional diseases be added to the prv list through the submission of a request to a special docket set up to facilitate the consideration of such requests, accompanied by information to document that the disease meets the statutory criteria required to be added to the prv list. while fda has not received a request to add the zika virus to the prv list via the docket, the agency does not want to foreclose anyone from following that process and will evaluate any submissions that are made with respect to the zika virus. fda wants to make it clear, however, that--based on the information currently available to fda--it is extremely unlikely that the zika virus meets the criteria set out in the [[page e500]] statute. while it appears likely that the zika virus disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations, it also appears that there is a significant market for the zika virus medical products in developed nations, which would render the zika virus ineligible for addition to the prv list under the statute at this time. fda agrees that we need to do all that we can to facilitate the development of and access to medical products as quickly as possible to respond to the zika virus outbreak. we fully believe that the incentives currently available for the zika product development--such as funding for research and development, and clinical trial costs from government and non-governmental organizations--as well as extensive hhs technical assistance for product developers, are sufficient to help bring zika products to market. fda is fully prepared to use its authorities to the fullest extent appropriate-- including proven mechanisms to speed the availability of medical products for serious diseases--to help facilitate the development and availability of products with the potential to mitigate this outbreak as quickly as the science will allow. however, expanding the prv program by adding diseases or conditions that do not meet the criteria for inclusion is unnecessary, weakens the effectiveness of the prv program, and creates an undue burden on fda that can ultimately harm public health. as you are aware, the administration has asked congress for approximately $1.9 billion in emergency funding to enhance our ongoing efforts to prepare for and respond to the zika virus, both domestically and internationally. approving this funding request, which includes support for medical product development and procurement, is essential for sustaining hhs's effort to effectively incentivize the development and availability of medical products for the zika virus. thank you, again, for contacting us concerning this matter. if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. the same letter has been sent to your cosigners. sincerely, dayle cristinzio, acting associate commissioner for legislation. ____________________",11621
CREC-2016-04-18-pt1-PgE500,CREC-2016-04-18,114,NO RATE REGULATION OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E500] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NO RATE REGULATION OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS ACT ______ speech of HON. KATHY CASTOR of florida in the house of representatives Friday, April 15, 2016 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration of the bill (H.R. 2666) to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from regulating the rates charged for broadband Internet access service: Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation Act. Many small businesses and many of my neighbors in the Tampa Bay area have experienced loss of internet, TV and phone services. I want to ensure that my neighbors and businesses are protected--I am fighting for them to receive the services they paid for. The No Rate Regulation Act aims to dismantle the open internet and take the ``cop off the beat'' by hamstringing the FCC's ability to protect the consumer. Because of these concerns on behalf of my neighbors and small businesses, today I will vote against this bill. This is timely legislation for all the wrong reasons. On April 1 of this year, Frontier Communications assumed Verizon's TV, internet and land-line phone services in the Tampa Bay area. Since the transition, small businesses and individual consumers in Florida have experienced loss of internet, TV and phone services. Consumers are paying for services they are not receiving. Even now, customers are reporting waiting for Frontier's technicians that are ``no shows''. Frontier appears to be unable to provide the necessary services to my neighbors, at the present time. I am here today to ensure all customers are protected. I have been fighting to protect the consumer and for robust public interest reviews. On February 2nd I stated in my letter to the FCC regarding the proposed Bright House Networks/Time Warner Cable/Charter merger that it is appropriate for the FCC to investigate that ``best practices'' are present on behalf consumers. The awesome power of the internet should be used to build up our community and grow opportunity for our children. I am proud that last year Tampa was selected as one of only 27 communities nationwide to participate in ConnectHOME, which promotes locally tailored solutions to help bridge the gap in digital access for working-class households by addressing the barriers they have to high-speed broadband. We should be dedicated to significant community boosts in access to digital opportunities for our students. We should be working with all agencies to develop the types of skills needed to secure today's higher paying jobs for all our kids. Instead of inviting a promising tomorrow, Republicans have chosen to focus on a bad bill with no future today. On the House floor Republicans have offered the No Rate Regulation Act. If passed it could undermine key provisions in the FCC's Open Internet order and harm the Commission's ability to protect consumers. This bill simply fails to define a clear definition and experts assert that the bill could result in unintended consequences. The No Rate Regulation Act is overly broad and extends far beyond the goals of codifying the FCC's forbearance from applying provisions of the Communications Act related to tariffs, rate approval, or other forms of utility regulation. The FCC should not be stymied in their participation of mergers and acquisitions like the Bright House/TWC/ Charter proposal. For example, I have said that BHN's Connect2Compete Program should be maintained, but as written, this legislation could undermine the FCC's ability to encourage customer service agreements that protect the most vulnerable. We have seen the Comcast Universal merger approval include the supply of an affordable internet program called the Internet Essentials. These stipulations are important and should be maintained in other deals moving forward. Mr. Chair, today I will vote against this Republican bill that could undermine key provisions in the FCC's Open Internet Order and harm the FCC's ability to protect consumers. We should not be undermining the FCC. This legislation could exacerbate already negative consequences for my neighbors in the Tampa Bay area. I will continue work to protect consumers and neighbors in my community and vote no on the No Rate Regulation Act. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E500] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NO RATE REGULATION OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS ACT ______ speech of HON.

TREY GOWDY of south carolina in the house of representatives Monday, April 18, 2016 Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, today I commend President Betsy Fleming of Converse College for her service to higher education and her remarkable impact on South Carolina. After growing up in Spartanburg, President Fleming left in 1984 to embark on her journey to become a renowned art-historian. Throughout her career, she held curatorial positions at several prominent museums across the United States as well as overseas in London. Prior to being named President of Converse College in 2005, Fleming served as the executive director of the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina. Under President Fleming's eleven years of leadership, Converse College experienced incredible transformation. During her tenure, Converse reduced its tuition by 43 percent and celebrated its largest undergraduate enrollment in over 25 years, becoming a national leader in affordability and value. Furthermore, Converse gained full NCAA Division II membership in eleven sports programs and raised more than $76 million in support. In addition to her impact on the Converse College community, President Fleming's service extends above and beyond her commitment in Spartanburg. An Aspen Institute Liberty Fellow, President Fleming serves on the Council of Presidents for the Association of Governing Boards (AGB), the Council of Independent Colleges (CIC) Steering Committee in the Future of Higher Education, and on the Board of Directors for both the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Charlotte Branch and Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina. President Fleming's impact on students, staff, and faculty will always be remembered, and her legacy will transform the future of Converse College. I thank President Fleming for her extraordinary service and congratulate her on her retirement. We look forward to the next chapter of her remarkable life as she continues to serve our community, state and country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E500] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMENDING BETSY FLEMING FOR HER SERVICE AS PRESIDENT OF CONVERSE COLLEGE ______ HON.

A former legislative assistant in my office, Rachel passed away on April 10, 2016, at the far-too-young age of 32. Those of us who had the honor to know Rachel knew her kind heart, deep faith, and compassion for others. Friends and former co-workers remembered her as a ``wonderful'' and ``lovely person,'' and a ``soft, sweet spirit,'' with a ``bright smile, kind words, and warm heart.'' Rachel was that rare person who could reach out to someone new and make him or her feel welcomed, supported, and encouraged. Her kindness left a mark on all who [[Page E501]] knew and worked with her--whether for a short time, or over the course of years. In her professional life, Rachel exemplified qualities worth emulating. In her work for the people of New Jersey's 5th Congressional District, she demonstrated a commitment to excellence and always strove to give her best. Her colleagues and friends alike, both on and off Capitol Hill, recognized her for her sharp mind, loving spirit, and inner strength. Rachel was devoted to causes greater than herself and impacted many lives beyond her work in Congress. In 2006, she participated in the Family Research Council's Witherspoon Fellowship program to prepare for leadership and service in the public arena. She was an accomplished writer, and she also shared her faith, time, and talent through various mission trips as well as through her church family. Rachel was a blessing in the lives of all who knew her. She loved her God, her country, and her fellow man--and she will be missed. My prayer is that God will comfort her family and friends during this time, and that they will know that Rachel's life will be remembered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E500-E501] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF RACHEL HOUSTON ______ HON.

JEFF MILLER of florida in the house of representatives Monday, April 18, 2016 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor Colonel Rocky McPherson, United States Marine Corps (Ret), for his more than fifty years of dedicated service to the State of Florida and our great Nation. A 1966 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Rocky received his commission in the United States Marine Corps. For more than 30 years, his military career took him around the globe, which began upon commission with the first of two combat tours and included a myriad of command and leadership roles. In his first combat assignment, Rocky deployed to Vietnam and served as an Infantry Officer with A Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines. When he returned home, he attended the Air Force flight school at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas. Having earned his wings, he moved on to his next assignment, mission qualification in the all-weather attack aircraft A6 Intruder. As a newly minted pilot, Rocky returned to Vietnam aboard the USS Coral Sea (CVA-43) as a Squadron Landing Signal Officer. During this second combat tour, he recorded numerous sorties over Vietnam and had over 160 carrier landings. His two combat tours earned him the distinction as the only Marine officer with both ground and aviation combat tours during the Vietnam war. For the next several tours, Rocky remained stateside. He served as the Marine Corps Representative at the United States Air Force Academy and at Marine Headquarters in Washington, D.C. He then commanded the Marine All Weather Attack Squadron 121 aboard the USS Ranger (CV-61); took on the responsibility of training and operations for more than 400 tactical aircraft as Deputy Wings Operations Officer in El Toro, California; and commanded the Marine Air Training Support Group at Whidbey Island, Washington, before returning abroad as Chief of Staff to III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) in Okinawa, Japan. Rocky made his final stop at Marine Corps Headquarters as Manpower Division Deputy Director before retiring as Colonel in 1995. Colonel McPherson's commitment to public service did not end there, however. From 1999 to 2007, he continued to serve in support of our Nation's heroes and in particular the more than 1.5 million veterans and their families in Florida, as the Executive Director of Florida Department of Veterans Affairs. During his tenure, he oversaw the most significant expansion of state veterans' nursing homes and was a driving force behind the Florida World War II Memorial and monument and the expansion of Bushnell National Cemetery. Additionally, he helped to ensure that wounded service members returning home from the Global War on Terror received the support and care they had earned. Florida is proud of being home to our Nation's servicemembers and veterans, and Rocky understands the critical importance that the military missions based in the state play in providing for our strong national defense. To that end, he has spent the last decade of his career in support of Florida's military installations as part of Enterprise Florida, Inc. He played an integral role in standing up the Florida Defense Support Task Force, created by Florida Statute, to preserve, protect, and enhance Florida's military missions and installations and currently serves as its Vice President of Military and Defense Programs, Strategic Partnerships. Rocky also assisted in creating and publishing the Florida Military Friendly Guide, a summary of all laws and programs in Florida benefitting active duty, Reserve and National Guard personnel and their families, as well as production of the Florida Defense Industry Economic Impact Analysis. Furthermore, he played an integral role in establishing the first-ever program for applying state resources to non-conservation lands transactions in Florida Statute to protect military missions from non-compatible development and other encroachment threats to the military value of Florida installations. He has been an active and valued voice on the State Advisory Council for the Association of Defense Communities. Without question, Colonel Rocky McPherson can hang his hat up on a career he can be proud of. He has proven to be an accomplished leader who has dedicated his life to serving the State of Florida and the United States of America, and his unwavering commitment to men and women in the Armed [[Page E502]] Forces and veterans' community will be felt for years to come. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, it gives me great pleasure to honor Colonel Rocky McPherson, United States Marine Corps (retired). My wife Vicki joins me in thanking Rocky and his wife, Connie, for their dedicated service. This includes Connie's 12 years in the United States Marine Corps. We wish them; their three children, Ashley, Nathan, and Courtney; grandchild; and all of the McPherson family all the best for continued success.

MIKE COFFMAN of colorado in the house of representatives Monday, April 18, 2016 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, April 10th marked the 37th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act. This landmark legislation, one of Congress' great achievements, has guaranteed and continues to guarantee ongoing relations with our friend and partner, Taiwan. Taiwan's President Ma made a speech at the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) Hsie Nian Fan celebration on March 30th, 2016. In the speech, President Ma pointed out that in the US-based Global Finance magazine's ratings of the world's richest countries from November of last year, Taiwan ranked 19th out of 185 countries worldwide. That put Taiwan right behind Germany, and far ahead of countries like France, Great Britain, Japan, and South Korea. Additionally, in the 2015 global competitiveness ratings published by the Institute of Management Development (IMD), in Lausanne, Switzerland, Taiwan ranked No. 11 in the world and No. 3 in the Asia- Pacific Region. Taiwan has created an enviable and thriving innovative economy. I give praise to President Ma's leadership. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a longstanding relationship that stems from our shared values: democracy, the rule of law, and free enterprise. Taiwan is a strong economic partner--in fact they are now our 9th-largest trading partner. In 2014, Colorado's exports to Taiwan reached $191.5 million. Taiwan is Colorado's 7th largest export market in Asia, and 14th largest export market in the world. Colorado companies have substantial opportunities to expand their business and cooperation with Taiwan. Equally important are the Taiwanese-Americans living in Colorado and the wealth of knowledge and entrepreneurial energy they bring. I offer my warmest and best wishes to the people of Taiwan on this 37th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. I also extend my congratulations to Dr. Tsai Ing-wen on her victory in the Taiwanese Presidential election. I look forward to the continued and growing friendship and partnership between the United States and Taiwan. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E501] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE 37TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT ______ HON.

Taiwan's President Ma made a speech at the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) Hsie Nian Fan celebration on March 30th, 2016. In the speech, President Ma pointed out that in the US-based Global Finance magazine's ratings of the world's richest countries from November of last year, Taiwan ranked 19th out of 185 countries worldwide. That put Taiwan right behind Germany, and far ahead of countries like France, Great Britain, Japan, and South Korea. Additionally, in the 2015 global competitiveness ratings published by the Institute of Management Development (IMD), in Lausanne, Switzerland, Taiwan ranked No. 11 in the world and No. 3 in the Asia- Pacific Region. Taiwan has created an enviable and thriving innovative economy. I give praise to President Ma's leadership. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a longstanding relationship that stems from our shared values: democracy, the rule of law, and free enterprise. Taiwan is a strong economic partner--in fact they are now our 9th-largest trading partner. In 2014, Colorado's exports to Taiwan reached $191.5 million. Taiwan is Colorado's 7th largest export market in Asia, and 14th largest export market in the world. Colorado companies have substantial opportunities to expand their business and cooperation with Taiwan. Equally important are the Taiwanese-Americans living in Colorado and the wealth of knowledge and entrepreneurial energy they bring. I offer my warmest and best wishes to the people of Taiwan on this 37th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. I also extend my congratulations to Dr. Tsai Ing-wen on her victory in the Taiwanese Presidential election. I look forward to the continued and growing friendship and partnership between the United States and Taiwan. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 162 Issue 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016) [Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E501] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE 37TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT ______ HON.

ART NICHOLAS ______ HON. THOMAS J. ROONEY of florida in the house of representatives Monday, April 18, 2016 Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Art Nicholas of Englewood, Florida, who was recently awarded France's highest military decoration, the ``Knight of the Legion of Honor.'' Mr. Nicholas was honored, at a ceremony in Englewood, for his service to France and its people during World War II. The Knight's Cross award was established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. Since World War II approximately 93,000 of these medals have been presented to American servicemen who risked their lives fighting on French soil during the war. Mr. Nicholas served aboard a landing ship (LCT52) during D-Day, the Allied assault to free occupied Europe in June of 1944. The invasion along France's northern coast was the largest amphibious invasion in history and led to the liberation of France from Nazi forces. Mr. Nicholas held the rank of boatswain's mate first class and worked as an underwater demolition man at the Gold Beach landing area. Nicholas was also at both Juno Beach and Omaha Beach. Earlier in the war, he participated in the invasion of North Africa in November in 1942 and was also awarded a Purple Heart. In addition to his combat service, Mr. Nicholas helped build the Amphibious Warfare School in Fort Pierce, Florida as a member of the ``Scouts and Raiders.'' He trained members of the Underwater Demolition Team in Fort Pierce, Florida who were the forerunners of today's Navy SEALs, who conduct quiet forays into enemy territory during conflicts in which the U.S. is involved. Mr. Nicholas left the military in 1946. He returned to Michigan and married his wife, Hazel, whom he met in England and has been married to for 69 years. He opened a business named Corrugated Paper Products, which created shipping containers in Indiana before moving to Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Art Nicholas for his service and commend him on receiving the highest military commendation the French government awards an individual. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E502] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MR.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``Life's most persistent and urgent question is, `What are you doing for others?''' Dr. Glover undoubtedly lives by this philosophy. From her work as an educator to her involvement in missions, Dr. Glover has made a tremendous impact on the lives of others. She is a woman of integrity who exudes the genuine principles and values of Christian discipleship. A charismatic evangelical leader and pioneer, her spiritual zeal is both infectious and highly contagious.

JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Monday, April 18, 2016 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 37th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. The Republic of China (Taiwan) is not only our close economic and security partner but a friend with whom we share many principles and values. Signed into law in 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act established the legal basis for our bilateral relations with Taiwan. I am pleased to say the U.S.-Taiwan bilateral relationship has continued to expand and grow stronger over the past thirty-seven years. As President Ma Ying-jeou remarked during The American Chamber of Commerce 2016 Annual Hsieh Nien Fan Gala, this relationship has also reaped benefits for the peaceful state of the East Asia and Asia-Pacific regions: ``First, the development of Taiwan-U.S. relations and the trilateral interaction involving the U.S., Taiwan, and the mainland over the past eight years have led to the warmest relations in more than 60 years.'' In a recent trip to Taiwan, I had the opportunity to experience firsthand our shared values and our close economic ties. In 2015, Taiwan was the United States' 9th largest trading partner and the bilateral trade between the United States and Taiwan reached $67.4 billion. My home state of California has also benefited from the strong commercial partnership. For example, in 2014, California's export to Taiwan reached $7.46 billion, making Taiwan California's 5th largest export market in Asia and 7th largest export market in the world. Additionally, as we recently recognized the 70th Anniversary of the end of World War II, it is appropriate to remember Taiwan's important contributions to the alliance that defeated fascist militarism. The United States and Taiwan work closely and that partnership continued as the United States helped Taiwan to overcome challenges and thrive following the end of the fighting. As a friend of Taiwan, I look forward to continuing to promote policies that reaffirm our mutual commitment to democratic and economic development. I urge my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 37th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E504] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE 37TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize April 17 as World Hemophilia Day, a day where the international community speaks as one to honor the hundreds of thousands of people across the globe suffering from hemophilia. Now, more than ever, we must renew our commitment to hemophilia patients, ensure that they can receive the most advanced care known to modern medicine, and redouble our efforts to discovering new treatments--and ultimately a cure--for this dangerous condition. Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that prevents blood from clotting properly, making even seemingly slight injuries a terrifying prospect for a bleeding episode that can lead to serious injury and even death. While the disease is rare in statistical terms, an estimated 400 newborns are diagnosed with the disease every year, and approximately 20,000 hemophiliacs live in the United States at this very moment. And all too often, this vulnerable patient population is put into jeopardy by the financial hurdles obstructing access to the intensive care needed for combatting such a pervasive disease. Too many American families are faced with the daunting challenge of tackling the financial burden of hemophilia--a burden that can grow to $250,000 a year or more. This World Hemophilia Day, I stand to speak out on behalf of the patients battling this complicated disease and hope that by raising awareness in this body, we move closer to a day where the treatment of hemophilia is practical, sustainable, and accessible for all Americans. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E504] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING APRIL 17 AS WORLD HEMOPHILIA DAY ______ HON.

RYAN K. ZINKE of montana in the house of representatives Monday, April 18, 2016 Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deepest concern over the recent surge in hostilities along the Line of Contact between Armenia and Azerbaijan which needlessly claimed dozens of lives on both sides. These skirmishes come just days after a successful visit by Azerbaijani President Aliyev with Vice President Biden and Secretary Kerry. Azerbaijan has been a staunch ally to the United States. It is critical to regional stability and global security that the recent hostilities are deescalated. It is no secret that Russia does not support the Southern Gas Corridor Project. This pipeline has been championed by Azerbaijan and would provide critical energy security for America's friends and allies in Europe. Accordingly this latest upsurge in fighting is another sign of Moscow's meddling in the affairs of states along its borders. As we have seen in Eastern Ukraine and Georgia, Russia continues to exploit separatist movements along its periphery to pressure our friends and allies in the region. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Armenia, Russia's key regional ally, has been used as a proxy to intimidate our partners, including Azerbaijan and Georgia. These latest hostilities between Azerbaijan and Armenia remind us of the urgency to find a peaceful solution to the protracted conflict. I urge the Administration to step up its efforts towards a peaceful solution and work with both sides to stabilize the region. Meanwhile, in the face of increasing Russian interference and aggression against its neighbors, the United States must remain steadfast in its support of friends like Azerbaijan. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E505] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOSTILITIES BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mary Beth Radigan, an outstanding educator and Hillsborough County's 2016 Teacher of the Year. After graduating from Ohio University with a degree in Special Education, Ms. Radigan began her illustrious career in special- education classrooms, including nine years in Hillsborough County as an educator for autistic and intellectually delayed students. She currently serves as special education teacher at Plant High School in Tampa, Florida. As a proud parent of a Plant High School student, I know firsthand how invaluable an educator is in developing the potential in all children. Ms. Radigan's passion for education is so well established in our community that she was selected from a pool of hundreds of nominees as the Hillsborough County Teacher of the Year. Accompanying her passion in the classroom, Ms. Radigan serves as a Special Olympics coach. Students in her classroom learn important life skills through numerous additional programs that she has spearheaded. In 2012, Ms. Radigan's class founded Pawbucks coffee, a coffee service, where her students have the opportunity to improve their job skills, social skills and independence. They are responsible for managing the business by making coffee, setting up the carts, selling and delivering coffee, answering phone orders and counting the total daily sales. Beyond practical skills, Pawbucks coffee has given students the opportunity to feel a great pride and a part of the school community. In addition to the coffee service, she and her students founded an organic garden that recently received a Florida Agriculture in the Classroom grant to buy a hydroponic tower. You can also find her students leading the cheering section at the weekly football games through the Paw Prints Cheerleading. Hillsborough County Teacher of the Year Mary Beth Radigan has shown time and time again her unwavering commitment and compassion to go above and beyond for her students. She has created a meaningful and enriching experience for all of her students and will leave a lasting legacy as a teacher with endless compassion and drive. It is one of my greatest honors to champion our community's excellent students and educators in Congress. On behalf of the constituents of the Fourteenth District of Florida it is our honor to recognize Mary Beth Radigan for her exemplary career of educating our community's youth.

SEBASTIAN LUJAN ""BEN"" BENAVIDEZ","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E505] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. SEBASTIAN LUJAN ``BEN'' BENAVIDEZ ______ HON. JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Monday, April 18, 2016 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Sebastian Lujan ``Ben'' Benavidez, a longtime Fresno civil rights leader, who passed away on April 4, 2016, at the age of 69. Mr. Benavidez will undoubtedly be remembered by the legacy he created through serving the community as a positive role model to all of those he encountered. Born on November 4, 1946 in Miami, Arizona, Mr. Benavidez was the son of Arizona copper miners. He moved to Fresno, California in 1962. He graduated from Washington Union High School, and continued on to attend Fresno City College. After college Ben worked for Parlier Unified School District. Mr. Benavidez is appreciated by many individuals throughout California, but he is especially treasured in the San Joaquin Valley, where he worked tirelessly to improve civil and economic rights for individuals throughout the region. Mr. Benavidez was a leader and spent decades advocating and working to improve the lives of immigrant families in the rural communities of the San Joaquin Valley and California. He became actively involved in the Mexican American Political Association (MAPA), serving as President for 13 years. As President of MAPA, Mr. Benavidez fought to expand opportunities in education, and led an effort to increase minority participation in local government. In the 1980s and early 1990s, he led boycotts and walkouts that helped more Latinos win city and school board positions. His efforts to expand opportunities for minorities in education decisions led him to take on Dinuba, and Kings Canyon Unified School districts in a battle to eliminate at-large elections, to ensure that school boards were reflective of the communities they served. Mr. Benavidez's unrelenting pursuit for social justice made him known to be fearless, and he demanded fairness. He fought for equality and improved educational opportunities for immigrant, migrant and minority children. He educated parents about their civil rights and their enormous political potential. Mr. Benavidez's contributions to his community, his philanthropic endeavors, and his work to expand small minority owned businesses led him to be honored by Parlier Unified School District with an elementary school named after him. In 2007, The Fresno Bee recognized Mr. Benavidez with the Latino Legends of the 20th Century Award, and in 2011, Mr. Benavidez was honored for his civil rights work, in advocating for minority civil and economic rights by the Greenlining Institute. Without question, Mr. Benavidez's integrity, honor and long-lasting involvement in the Central Valley made him a reputable man. He was well known, beloved, and shown enormous appreciation by anyone who had the pleasure of calling him a friend. Mr. Benavidez leaves behind his loving family, including his wife of 49 years, Gloria, their two sons and two daughters, their respective spouses, twelve grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It is my honor to join his family in celebrating the life of this amazing man, who will never be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to honor the life of Mr. Ben Benavidez. He will be remembered for his contributions and service to our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E505] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF MR.

Bruce was a prominent Arizona political scientist and pollster who taught and conducted research at Arizona State University for the past forty years. Bruce was an Arizona native who taught political science and conducted regular opinion surveys of Arizona voters and provided political commentary to news outlets. No elected official in Arizona was elected to office without the knowledge of Merrill's research. He was a factual, objective voice focused on finding out what Arizonan's wanted from their leaders. His perspective and deep knowledge of the Arizona electorate will be deeply missed. Bruce was also a U.S. Navy veteran who served as a liaison officer to members of Congress and other political leaders. He studied political research at Brigham Young University and joined the faculty at ASU in 1970. He retired from the university in 1998 as a professor emeritus and served as a fellow for the Morrison Institute, a research center focused on public policy in Arizona. Bruce is survived by his wife, Janis, daughter Kathryn Sorensen, son Christopher and his wife's children, Laura Sonius, Brian Sandler and Heather Lautt and a host of grandchildren.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Walt Titus on his recent retirement from the Gravity, Iowa Fire Department. Walt served as a firefighter for more than 58 years. Walt became a volunteer firefighter in the mid-1950s in Kirkman, Iowa and has worked for the Sharpsburg and Gravity Fire Departments over the course of the next 58 years. He did anything that needed to be done in service to the department. He was quoted in the Bedford Times-Press stating that commitment is the key to a volunteer fire department. ``If a fire alarm goes off, there is a blizzard and it's 10 below zero, some want to stay home. When you're committed, you get up and go whether you feel like it or not.'' It is that attitude which exemplifies the Iowa spirit of volunteerism and pride. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the United States Congress join me in commending Walt for his service to Taylor County. I consider it an honor to represent Walt in United States House of Representatives and wish him the best in his retirement from his firefighting duties. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E506] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO WALT TITUS ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 18, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress we know well, perhaps better than most, how blessed our nation is to have in reserve such exceptional young men and women who will go on to become leaders in their local communities, states, and the nation in the areas of business, education, government, philanthropy, the arts and culture, and the military. We know this because we see them and benefit from their contributions every day. Many of them work for us in our offices as junior staff members, congressional fellows, or interns and they do amazing work for and on behalf of the constituents we are privileged to represent. Mr. Speaker, I believe there is no higher calling than the call to serve a cause larger than ourselves. That is why I ran for public office. I was inspired to serve by President Kennedy who said, ``Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,'' and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said: ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. . . . You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.'' By this measure, there are several other great young men and women who served as volunteers this year in my offices. They may toil in obscurity but their contributions to the constituents we serve are deeply appreciated. That is why today I rise to pay tribute to eight extraordinary young persons for their service to my constituents in the 18th Congressional District of Texas and to the American people. They are: Remmington Belford from Texas Southern University; Bianca Remmie from the University of Texas at Austin; Madelyn Wilson from the University of Houston; Promise Ukandu from Texas Tech University; Gabriela Irizarry from the George Washington University; Itzayana Lopez from the University of Houston-Downtown; Taylor Rainey from Howard University; and Karis Johnson, Esq. from St. Mary's Law School. Mr. Speaker, the energy, intelligence, and idealism these wonderful young people brought to my office and those interning in the offices of my colleagues help keep our democracy vibrant. The insights, skills, and knowledge of the governmental process they gain from their experiences will last a lifetime and prove invaluable to them as they go about making their mark in this world. Because of persons like them the future of our country is bright and its best days lie ahead. I wish them all well. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that such thoughtful committed young men and women can be found working in my office, those of my colleagues, and in every community in America. Their good works will keep America great, good, and forever young. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 162, Number 59 (Monday, April 18, 2016)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E507] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE 18TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES ______ HON.
